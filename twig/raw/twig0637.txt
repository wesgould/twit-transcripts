[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.000]   In an amazing place
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.640]   So Mike Elgin as many people know who was he was our news director for a couple of years
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.680]   I tied him down actually literally had to tie his leg down
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.400]   He's a nomad and made him live in Petaluma and for two years with his wife
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.960]   But as soon as I let him go he floated back up and he's now
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.080]   He and Amira go all over the world. They've lived all over the world and they decided to make
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.640]   You know some use of that by creating these gastro nomad
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.600]   Experiences if you go to gastronomad.net
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.680]   We did the one in Wohaka. They said this is the last one they're gonna do on day of the day
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.720]   Although they will do Christmas next year in Wohaka, Mexico. They do Provence

[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.280]   Mexico City there Proseco is coming up and
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:09.000]   Provence, I think I think it's last I think there's like a couple more seats left in the Proseco
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.760]   It's a small group. There were ten other couples many of whom listened to it. Hello. Mm-hmm. Hello all of you and
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.280]   We just had a blast they rented a villa
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.680]   And we all were in the same villa and we did all these exclusive things including my favorite, which was a cooking
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.680]   You would have loved this one Stacy
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.120]   So Amir never tells us what we're doing to do the day of the day up which drove Lisa crazy. Oh, yeah
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.760]   That was driving it. What do I wear? What do I bring? Nope? Just she says we're comfortable shoes. I
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.480]   Like that's how I should be some people well most of the people loved it. I was neutral. Mm-hmm Lisa was going
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.100]   So we just all they say is you know have breakfast
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.000]   We'll meet you downstairs at nine all right get in the van
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.320]   We show up at the about the big open-air market. There's several in Oaxaca. Oaxaca's a big foodie town in Mexico
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.960]   Mm-hmm
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.500]   So we go to the open-air market and we are met by chef Alejandro Ruiz chef Alex who was the best known
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.800]   He's actually put Oaxaca cuisine on the map
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.760]   He has three restaurants. He has a hotel, but he's also my chrstaiden is home, right?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.400]   Yeah, my their friends we yeah
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.680]   I didn't know we was but as we're going through the market with him and his
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.460]   Manuensis who was carrying bags and loading them with food people are you with chef Alex?
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.640]   Chef Alex he's like a celebrity. Oh man
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.440]   So we shopped for like three hours we stopped and we had tacos at Dunio Valle's
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.600]   which is apparently also famous because it was on Netflix street food and
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.880]   So they cleared it out the seats even though it's jammed and we sat down and then we shopped and we then we went out to chef
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.760]   Alex's boyhood home where he's built this complex including a
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.960]   They call him fire kitchens. It's all wood-fired
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.280]   Big kitchen with lots of workstations and we cooked for hours
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.720]   sat down among the things that we did while cooking was
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.280]   He's at one point chef Alex is okay. It's time to go get grasshoppers
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.640]   So
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:13.040]   That was kind of my way what so so we all go out to that they have the beautiful shoes to stop on them
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.600]   Well, I wish we don't I would have worn my grasshopper hunt and shoes
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:24.560]   But so we went out into the herb gardens apparently these grasshoppers taste like whatever they eat. Oh, okay, so
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.520]   Chicken that's it tastes like chicken. So we go out. Let me show you I'll show you pictures of
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.960]   of us

[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:02.880]   So you catch these grasshoppers and they roast them and then they put them on top of the guacamole

[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.080]   Rotating so you can think better on it. You can't edit it
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.480]   But at least you can pull it back before it goes into but all that means is they just are posting it
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   That's all I do it. Yeah, two is
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:33.280]   It's scroll brought to life in that links to various publishers like the Washington Post
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.800]   From the Twitter feed will go there without ads doesn't get your run the paywall or anything
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.640]   Mm-hmm. You would add free experience for that story and some and some of the revenue goes to those publications. Yeah. Oh, yes, absolutely
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:52.080]   And then three is the return of a form of nuzzle so hot news is whatever
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:57.440]   Your the people you follow on Twitter keeps have been linking to so that that's what got me
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:03.340]   I miss I miss nuzzles. I was a huge nuzzle fanatic so sad when they got bought by a Twitter
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.480]   So where do I go? There's a hot news?
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.960]   But if you go to the there's a little fire on your on your left
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.880]   margin at least that's on the web version when we see what oh on the web so we go on the web
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.400]   How do I give them money? I haven't seen any I mean I've seen you know, but I haven't you go to your profile
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.600]   I found it already and you'll see blue there's cold articles. It's in the menu, right?
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.480]   Okay, I don't know what I'm seeing
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.680]   Why to me this is why I'm not a fan of Twitter. It's a little random anyway
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:40.880]   Follow Chris Saliza. You deserve what you I deserve what I get your exact right top articles
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.080]   Is this what you're this is the new nuzzles top articles. Yes. Okay, so these are
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.760]   This is because I know well, it's the same as mine
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.760]   Yeah, cuz you know you follow the same people I do probably
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.640]   Also more I don't care about the Goddard school district ordering 29 books removed from circulation
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:06.000]   I don't even know where Goddard is how the media missed a New Jersey Senate candidates races social media posts
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.840]   Malala got married. Okay. That's nice. Yeah, it's nice
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.480]   Mark Ruffalo and Jonathan Scott have a leg tile dysfunction skip
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.680]   real earnings summary
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:26.160]   Don't know CNN poll skip 51 month sentence for QAnon shaman. Oh, yeah, that was an interesting
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.000]   They're going there through the I guess that's what you call throw in the book Adam
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.480]   Mm-hmm, and we'll see if he gets it if they get it, but that's what the prosecutors are asking for so these are so these are
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.120]   This is Nuzzle you're saying it's not as yeah
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.600]   It's not as good as Nuzzle was because I had different things and but these are articles most shared in my
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:53.800]   Network of people can I change it's only last 24 hours? There's no there's no settings. It looks like for this
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:00.000]   But that's okay. I'm gonna give it a try for a month. I love a nose for a miss for having Nuzzle like features
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.960]   That's worth three bucks. Well to me the best feature is look at my look
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:12.000]   I made my Twitter feed purple and I have a new Twitter icon. Oh about that. I ain't that cute. That's worth three bucks by itself
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.080]   Three bucks a month. I actually I have I have good stories in mine. Oh good
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:24.120]   I have Chris Dixon on the future of crypto. Although that's so old the Virgis background policy, which good for I have that at the top
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   I don't even know why I care about that
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:33.200]   The Virgis editor up policy. It's actually a really good policy. We can talk about it if you want to or on background means
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.520]   You you're talking to somebody, but you're not gonna quote him
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:42.480]   Yeah, but you know a lot of times like I've been getting pushback like Amazon Google or famous for this
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.520]   They'll just so on background. I'll bring up an issue right where and then they give you the most
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:53.000]   Jargony stupid non-answer and I'm like, yeah, it's not effing anything. That's just
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.960]   So I'm I clicked that by the way and now I got a special
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:04.760]   On top blue. Here's the verge of that in the ads start reading PS ad free articles doesn't include paywall access right now
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.360]   So this is the ad free version which I'm getting anyway because I use an ad blocker
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.600]   But still I'm glad the verge gets they could incorporate paywall stuff
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.560]   I mean like I mean I have 50 million subscriptions
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:22.920]   But for you if I could subscribe to Twitter blue for like 10 bucks a month and click on all the articles that I'm interested in
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.840]   Oh, that's actually a really interesting process
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.080]   So you'd pay more if it were more complete more
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:36.200]   comprehensive I can't seem to think normal people would if you pay like do you think normal people pay even three bucks for Twitter?
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.240]   If you could get access to the news articles that people are tweeting yes
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:47.360]   Because then it becomes like your gateway to all the media. Here's what your old buddy. Oh Malek has to say
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:54.200]   This would be good. He says when you subscribe
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.240]   I did you get additional icon the right hand menus his top articles
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.760]   I like the conversation panel that opens up when you highlight the article before clicking on the link to read it off
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.080]   Twitter the ad free readings
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:12.880]   Thus far underwhelmed me there were three articles in my entire 24-hour top news articles timeline
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.720]   No kids that we obviously are getting more maybe it just hasn't you know kind of
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.240]   Worked out yet
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.800]   Notice though. It wasn't just people we were following it was people we were following
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:31.160]   Divided by the the publications that would allow it to be ad-free which meant there was a lot of junk in there a lot of chaff in there
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.640]   For me well mine is looking okay so far as pulling up a lot of college football stuff because this season for me
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:44.000]   Home says despite the shortcomings. I'm willing to try this new offering at least for six months after all like most of us
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.040]   I don't want to sign up for individual magazine or newspaper subscriptions. I
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.400]   surprised at home does not because you and I mean it's
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.120]   Yeah, but I mean if you think about it, I pay probably I
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:04.120]   Pay at least a thousand dollars a year in subscription me to so New York Times Washington Post the Atlantic the New Yorker
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.600]   Bloomberg
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:14.120]   You know I the information alone is 400 bucks a year. I stopped that I got rid of the information this year
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:20.680]   I found Bloomberg way more interesting and relevant Bloomberg's expensive. It's even more, but it's worth it. It's 400
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.440]   It's the same as the is it the same. Oh, okay. I was paying the monthly which is like 39 bucks
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   Oh
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:33.600]   After all the bigger question home rights remains unanswered what percentage of
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.560]   397 million Twitter users will pay this is my question - will pay 36 dollars a year for these premium
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.560]   Features, I think people in our business will yeah, it won't be
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.760]   Yeah, it's hard to give people the pony up for something they perceive they've been getting for free
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.760]   Tell me about it. I know all about that
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.520]   Nevertheless Twitter should stick with it says home because in time people will start to see value in this premium upgrade. I
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.000]   Think so and if they get enough people who matter so journalists actually matter
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.040]   You know, you know you reach journalists on this platform and you can push stories, right?
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:14.480]   Who will then write about your stories? You could see some sort of like media subscription come from that and that's worthwhile or
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.160]   Twitter also has their newsletter things
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.680]   So maybe as an individual newsletter person if I write something really awesome
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:28.360]   I would love the chance to get a little bit of money from people reading it, you know, how would this affect your sub stack?
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.600]   prescription
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.960]   Only unless Twitter did a deal with sub stack. Yeah, how would it affect all of the independent folks out there using medium and
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:43.080]   Substacks let's say if I had a publication and I charge people five dollars a month for it
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.240]   And then maybe something and I had this and I was doing it through I can't what is Twitter's newsletter platform?
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   Does anyone remember what they buy no idea?
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.880]   Okay, whatever their platform is
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.600]   if I if I
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:01.240]   Had my regular subscription base, but then I did something that's a little bit more general interest and people wanted to read it I
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.160]   could
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:08.760]   Maybe click a button and Twitter would make it available through that and they could share some revenue back from the virality of it
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.120]   That would be really interesting to me what Aaron Rupar is doing on Twitter. It's kind of interesting
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.360]   He did he's a journalist. It just started. He is great
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.160]   He watches all the Fox News stuff for the Trump stuff and everything else and pulls up the videos
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.760]   He's invaluable so he watches so you don't have to Twitter is a perfect medium for him
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.840]   He just started a brand new newsletter
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.320]   So he tweeted the written house trial live tweeted it and then said I'm tapping out for now
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.240]   But if you appreciate it check out my newsletter for him. There's a lot of value
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.600]   Yeah
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.200]   Twitter is kind of the perfect medium for what he what he did with that, right?
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.760]   He is perfect for that because he pulls videos of everything and and makes it terribly shareable
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.800]   He's Aaron is is he deserves battle pay for what he does
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.080]   So we don't have to watch what he watches, but he's great
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:02.440]   But will this pull people off of Facebook for their news you think no Twitter
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.640]   To make Twitter is a very specialized audience. I mean 300 some million people tells you right there
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.320]   Compared to the winners for better for me for news
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.760]   Yeah, we're the exact news from Facebook. No, we're the exact
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:23.160]   Audience for Twitter, but that's not a big and that's fine. Well, but that's this it. That's that's
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:30.280]   What's gotten us in trouble is scale for scale sake scale for scale alone be as big as possible
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.780]   I agree and I agree
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:37.060]   This is where I love about project blue, but see to me Twitter's not niche enough
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:43.020]   Well, that's why blue matters not not this blue but the blue sky matters because
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:49.140]   You know if the if the speech layer becomes commodified, but the curation selection
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.580]   confirmation
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:56.540]   Authority layer becomes selective and you can pick who you want to define just the stuff you want
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:03.320]   Then maybe maybe Mirable dick to you stop complaining wouldn't it be interesting if somebody explained what Mirable dick to means?
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.260]   No, I wouldn't be interesting. No, I don't mean wouldn't it be interesting Phoenix Warps suggests this I think
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.820]   He's saying it may also filter out the crap on Twitter just like our discord
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.340]   No one's gonna pay to troll and just tweet out crap
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:22.600]   But right now I'm seeing stuff from people who pay and not pay wouldn't it be nice to have a setting that said only Twitter blue people
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.600]   Then it really becomes I think I get there
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.180]   Yeah, right now it's 10 people that's definitely maximizing
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:38.160]   Tony Hale Tony Hale alone is worth today in a month
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.900]   Yeah, Tony was the founder of scroll and chart beat before that well
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:47.100]   They bought okay, they bought scroll and I've been seeing that's one of the benefits of Twitter blue. What is scroll?
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.360]   So scroll was intended to say to publishers
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:57.000]   You're losing people you're losing money to add blockers. You're never gonna get money from them
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.980]   What we can do instead is we can offer a group subscription basically where somebody come in and they'll get an ad-free
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:10.200]   Experience legit and you'll get a kind of the revenue Tony never said it was gonna solve every problem the news industry
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.980]   We're gonna be helpful was gonna give them money. They weren't getting and so
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.980]   But he trying to get all the publishers to sign up was was torture
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:27.180]   So you got a lot of them but but still so then Twitter bought him and acquired him his brains and his team and they included that scroll-esque
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:32.740]   Feature into Twitter, but again all it does is give you I already subscribed to the Washington Post
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.820]   So I now get a page without ads the Washington Post. I actually be fine with the ads the Washington Post
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.460]   They're not awful. I don't subscribe anymore to the Atlantic because it overdose me
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:47.660]   And so if I go to the link to the Atlantic, I'll still hit my you know two a month and you're done, Bob
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.900]   But I'll get them without ads
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.380]   This is definitely getting better for me the more I scroll
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.980]   This just you just turn it on. Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely getting better
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.100]   I'm seeing of course
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:05.420]   I see a lot of twit content on there, but I'm seeing a lot of tech news in here now in addition in the in the
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.860]   Top stories from the top articles. Okay. Yeah, this is this is so much better
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:15.060]   So there's something on the right of top articles. I guess that's scroll conversation. Oh, I don't know
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.260]   I didn't even yeah. Oh, I guess that's a
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.260]   Whoa, not as cool. Oh
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.060]   So click on an article
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:29.860]   conversation about it. Oh dude. That's that's something that Nuzle did not have and I kind of like yes, they did. Yes, yes, Nuzle
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:35.060]   You could see well, you see all the names, but you wouldn't see it scrolling like this. But this is much better
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:43.020]   Yeah, this is cool. Oh, oh, yeah, give you some context. Yeah, here's Jason Howell. So I'm tweeting about it
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.780]   I do feel like this is an improvement
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.540]   In the Twitter experience
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:56.660]   So far, I don't mind spending so good on them good on this it's a it's a nice price point three bucks a month
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.660]   Yeah, so far. I don't mind it
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:03.620]   The Washington Post subscription for me was about the same price
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.700]   I believe because of pro four bucks a month
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.420]   I think 450 or something and I got nothing out of it, but this is so much more meat
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:16.380]   Now here's like the Washington Post I got nothing out of that subscription
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:21.260]   I would pull it up and it was it was almost like doom scrolling everything was just
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.200]   Sad news. I'm a little disappointed by the Washington Post - I agree with you
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.020]   But I individual are I wouldn't but I don't do that for the times either
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.740]   Just go to their site and scroll through it
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:36.940]   But I I pay for it because when individual articles show up in the other feeds, right then I want to be able to see that
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:43.460]   Without a paywall and I think enough and tech meme and other things that I'm gonna see those
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:48.300]   Yeah, so they'll scroll down on the left side until you find Washington Post or
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:54.860]   Verge one of those under top articles under top articles. You'll see a blue bar that says add free with Twitter blue
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.860]   Yeah, right here. Yeah, so click on the article click on the article. Okay, because you probably have an ad blocker
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:05.140]   Anyway, no, we already did that. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I was I remember that's why I was showing you the pop-up that said
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:10.340]   So is tweeting
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.900]   No, I wasn't I was screaming that I just spent a
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.340]   By the way, how do I look at one gig?
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:23.540]   Good good. It's actually better. Isn't it? He's still yellow. He's not as well. No, he was pink before
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:32.540]   Converts you to yellow, which is good. I think those of us who pay for one gig would prefer calling gold gold
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.740]   Delights balance
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.820]   Yeah, no, I didn't look you look good your smooth
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.340]   Frame rates good, but you're saying you dropped out for us
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.740]   Yeah, I dropped out they were supposed to give me eight boxes to replace my boxes
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.580]   I got two of the eight they're supposed to come Friday. They don't say Friday whoever told you Friday
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:56.340]   No Friday. They're supposed to do all this last Tuesday. They didn't do much of it. I'm screaming on the phone, but hey
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.340]   I look better. I
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.260]   Will say what you screaming on the corded telephone
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.780]   Yes, everybody that in case they forgot what you have a corded telephone that thing was awesome. Just pick that up
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.780]   It was like holy
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.920]   Where'd you get that? Was there an antique store in
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:18.700]   What the hell no, this is my line line children my land line line
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:24.340]   What is this what you're this weird thing? Yeah, it's called a dial tone
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:32.140]   So I will say Twitter is still the place to go for customer service
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:36.620]   How would you figure that well? Yeah, I just did that with I just did that with with Lisa
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.620]   We had
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:43.500]   So it was solar city we got our solar panels solar city now a Tesla company and we didn't know it
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.500]   But at the time they installed
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.800]   decorative
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:53.260]   triangular solar panels that aren't actually truss solar panels and you can see this is a picture the regular solar panels look fine
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:58.380]   But the one that cut the cosmetic solar panels are starting to look terrible
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.900]   Yeah, that might be a problem
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.740]   So we called and called and they said that's how we found out they're cosmetic
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:07.620]   But then we never heard from so finally Lisa tweeted the next day they came and took him
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.860]   So I agree with you on that if you want something done to him yep
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.340]   And that while Elon Musk is busy
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:20.620]   Destroying his stock with in a Twitter. So that was that was pretty good. They could do two things at once. I thought that was impressive
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.140]   very impressive
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.380]   What Elon what a character?
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.140]   Wow, how often is he find for he's very rarely
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.780]   Verit which is surprising right with a lot he should be fine more often. I think
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:40.500]   That's what gets me like this dude should be writing a lot of checks
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.900]   Because a lot happens just based on what he tweets and yet and this I was at this show
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:51.020]   It was I think was on Twitter it was on Twitter where somebody had called him a B. S. Or
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.100]   Who delivers yeah, and that's the thing
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.700]   I mean the the dragon reentry the crew survived crew two is doing great
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:02.740]   And now they've already turned it around for the next lunch. Yeah, so it's gotta give him that
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:09.860]   Yeah, I give him that but don't necessarily follow his cryptocurrency picks speaking of way pumping down baby
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.100]   Well, actually I don't think he's even doing that. I think he just enjoys
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:18.340]   Watching his stock price and his doge. Well, he's also paying a tax bill
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.260]   Yes, so that story so he's gonna trade in ten billion dollars
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:26.700]   Well, he knew what was gonna happen. He goes on Twitter and says should I sell yeah, they're completed
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.900]   Stop paying taxes on our assets. Should I just sell 10 trillion?
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.340]   You know, it's what's gonna happen people gonna say yeah, so he's gonna say I followed the market
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:38.700]   I sold the 10 trillion he has like a 10 trillion tax bill to 10 10 billion
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.860]   I know but it's what it gets that big what difference is it?
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.740]   And so it was all good, but he also depressed his stock
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.820]   Start just as he was selling it which I guess means he can't accuse him inside her trading where he does that
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:55.140]   So yeah, and he's got it though, man. Although somebody did somebody did tweet wouldn't it be nice
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:31:00.540]   If instead of having to take a Twitter poll on whether you should pay your taxes if if Congress actually made
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:09.420]   Right imagine that so Twitter this this was a little reported story is getting into crypto as well
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.580]   They've hired
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:17.340]   Tess Reinerson. She just tweeted I've thrilled to share I've joining Twitter to lead a new team focused on crypto blockchain
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.700]   and other decentralized
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.700]   technologies is she part of
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.580]   Project blue or what was blue sky I or it's unclear
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:31.180]   But what so what is I mean this is this is Jack Dorsey in a nutshell, right? He's
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:36.380]   Let's put your tweet on on on the blockchain. You're never gonna be able to edit it
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:46.340]   She says we know where we will be working closely with the blue sky team to help shape the future of decentralized social media
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:53.900]   Twitter crypto will underpin all this work and serve as a center of excellence for all things blockchain at Twitter
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.900]   So they're gonna build their own blockchain. I don't know
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:05.220]   But why first we'll be exploring how we could support the growing interest among creators to use decentralized apps to
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.860]   Mange virtual goods and currencies and to support their works and communities
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:13.700]   This is my only problem with blockchain and FT's and crypto is I understand the words
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.740]   But I understand what it means
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:23.980]   We'll be figuring out what crypto can do for Twitter as well as what Twitter can do for crypto oh
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.740]   hubris
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.260]   asked not what Twitter can do for crypto
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:35.180]   Twitter truly gets crypto hello Bitcoin tipping and NFTs
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:40.180]   But there's so much more to explore here. She has excellent credentials is an early
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:44.260]   Proponent of crypto has worked on a lot of interesting and the head of
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:48.300]   Blue sky also has
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:53.020]   That's right credentials. That's right and I think I'm very excited about blue sky
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.500]   I think I think that there is a there's a next generation
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:01.260]   So the one thing that I guess makes sense to me is crap blockchain is essentially about a
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.940]   decentralized ledger decentralized
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.380]   record
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:12.060]   So it gets it makes sense if you're talking about a decentralized social network that there might be some sort of synergy between blockchain
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.980]   I'm not sure exactly how that would work
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.460]   but
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.460]   It does make sense for instance
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:25.020]   We have a mastin on instance. Mm-hmm. That's a federated social media looks just like Twitter Twitter social
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.740]   No, there is one no no one central server on that
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.420]   Everybody runs a server as we do
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:41.140]   Has their copies of their content that their users have created which then gets shared to other people's is truly federated
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:47.660]   Without a centralized core. You don't need blockchain to do that. I don't know how blockchain would enhance that right?
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:55.540]   That's what I want to know. What's the point of it? We already have federated social in place. That's working just fine emails federated really
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.900]   I mean
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.620]   It look how well that was a lot of people's telling me he thinks it's gonna be a Twitter crypto wallet
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.660]   which is another problem because
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:09.020]   Well, Dorsey's already just a bit coin in a wallet that's
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:15.540]   For the masses and then you have some other blockchain that people know nothing about that's what's going on with all the NFTs
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:20.180]   Because there's so many different chains out there you can buy an NFT over here
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:25.740]   But you can't buy that same one over there unless you have this wallet this token so on this is too much
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:32.140]   Jack Dorsey's other company square has already announced. It's making a hardware wallet for Bitcoin
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:37.780]   So you can lose it. I keep forgetting that he and he and Square like yeah, you know
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:43.500]   That makes it. I mean Bitcoin crypto makes a lot of sense in in Square Square. Yeah
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:47.500]   Yo, I have some issues. I cannot work my phone
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:52.140]   You brand new pixel six
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:57.780]   My brand new pixel six here try this try to listen to y'all, but I'm having a hard time
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.300]   I'm trying try this just try this trying to this works so well
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.540]   This works so well for me just press and hold the volume up and down button
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:11.340]   You know, there's one button press and hold both ends of that and just keep holding that okay. Just try see what happens
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.180]   I don't want it to make a loud noise. I
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:20.420]   So I did this during Windows weekly and all of a sudden it's reading the screen reader comes on talk back
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.700]   I can't figure out how to turn it off because everything I touch because I
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:29.340]   Couldn't I was I had to turn off my mic and just stop participating in Windows weekly
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.860]   So don't do that Stacy please we want you to be part of the show was wrong
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.820]   What's wrong?
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:41.460]   Wait a minute. Let's take a break. I'm gonna do an ad we will help Stacy Higginbotham with her brand new
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.420]   Pixel 6 Pro when we come back see that's Google
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:51.300]   That is some Google service is and it's helpful. It just took us 33 minutes to get there some actual Google in this show
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.140]   This week in Google Pixel 6 Pro
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.940]   That's called that's we haven't talked about Google yet for quite a while
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:04.180]   So I think the ideas you go around all the time with a shot class and just whenever somebody is around you
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:10.080]   They pour meh's Callen to it. It's just it never it's always it's I've long said it should be a controlled substance
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:15.940]   We went to one place. There's three ways you can make meh's Cal industrial, which is how most liquors made a big
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:22.340]   Trans
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:31.060]   Unsestra which is everything's clay and it's like really like how it used to be made a hundred
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.900]   Years ago, so we went over to an asset austral place in the mezcalero
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.280]   Which is what you call the guy who makes me down. He's wearing a cowboy hat looks just like John Love
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.280]   It's just imagine John Love it's in a cowboy hat
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:49.060]   And and he's got a giant funnel I mean not I mean like a gallon
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:55.060]   Funnel and he's got his finger over the tip, right and he just goes around everybody goes mezcal
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:04.340]   Because I guess the reason for the fun was this just came out of the distillery out of the out of the still man
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.340]   So he captured it in his giant funnel
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.420]   Where our mask
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.940]   This was something usually
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.340]   me this
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.780]   of
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.060]   Gastronomad Mescal I did I have it and it's wonderful. I haven't opened it yet
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.220]   The other thing that happened at the same mez at the same ancestral
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.420]   It was a mez mezcal de los angeles
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:35.500]   The angels I don't know right was they had a medicine man come around and and cleanse us
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:41.060]   So they burnt this incense and they blew incense up and down our bodies. Oh wow he wiped us off with
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:46.780]   herbs and stuff and and he said by the way, he says I'm a medicine man
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:53.320]   But I'm also a chiropractor if you need a just and then and then and then he comes around and spits
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:38:00.100]   Mezcal down your front in the back as part. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. There's a picture. No
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:09.700]   Where are the mask and someone is spinning on your bread and alcohol it probably killed it's 50% alcohol
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.380]   It's 100 proof. So there's no COVID in that right, but I was a little damp
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:20.700]   What's the point it's a tradition it's ancient tradition we also
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.700]   face
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.700]   We each face each
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:30.700]   Direction is like really dumb convince them this is a tradition
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:34.220]   tradition
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.300]   tradition
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:42.620]   It was actually great fun and no when you when in Rome, you know actually Lisa said no no mezcal down my front
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.700]   But I thought I'm gonna play the game
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:51.740]   Thing of course you waited no, I wanted I wanted to do it our show today brought to you by
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.220]   Melissa

[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:08.540]   Yes, Melissa's data matching can eliminate clutter and duplicates increasing the accuracy of your database
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:13.020]   And reducing postage and mailing costs and it's by the way, it's not just addresses

[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:32.700]   Lot of Melissa's customers use their incredible API to build this into their customer service software
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:38.300]   To build this into their shopping carts because you know, honestly a lot of times the addresses get
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.940]   Miss entered, you know for a long time
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.740]   I I swapped the numbers on our street address
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:50.140]   So even your customers could be doing this and then you can even get information to complete your customer profiles better public

[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:06.060]   Well, it's very flexible. There's an on-prem software solution. There's a web service
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:10.220]   You they even have a secure ftp site. You can upload and download from
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:14.060]   You can use software as a service delivery. They have a new lookups app
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.300]   Check it out on iOS and google
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:21.100]   You can enter in addresses names and more at your fingertips and fix that onesie to see
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.740]   But probably the best way to do it is with their API
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:28.540]   You can just incorporate it right into your software and don't worry Melissa treats
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:34.300]   Your customer records as they should be treated like like gold they undergo
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:40.140]   continuous independent security audits to reinforce that commitment to data security

[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.700]   So what do you mean you changed your address numbers
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:21.980]   So we are at 2991. I would constantly type in 21 19
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:26.380]   Oh, I see how we first moved there. No, I just not a purpose. No, no, no
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:31.580]   Stupidly and stuff was getting misdelivered all the time. I screw up the studio address
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:36.780]   Uh go with 54 because that's the zip code here. Yeah, I mean it should be 51
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:41.660]   So I apple thought that's maybe why I didn't get the laptop, but I checked and know they had the right address
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.740]   I do that every single time
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:51.500]   So that's why you need melissa. That's all I could say big bill coming to google the eu anti trust fine
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:58.540]   2.7 billion dollars google appealed and lost this is such an old case
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.940]   It comes from a ridiculous case. There's other things to go after google on the ad business
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:08.540]   You can go after google on anti trust but the shopping case well, but this but it was like it's a 10 year old case
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:13.100]   That's why it takes a while to when it's way that even when it was done. It wasn't it wasn't right
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.740]   They don't even shop the little shopping anymore. No, but the the contention was that google
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.580]   Favor its own shopping service in its search results
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.340]   You know
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.900]   At the time we tried it it didn't seem to be the case
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:33.420]   But I think it's safe to say that it does sometimes look like google's youtube is at the top or if they still had google shopping
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:39.340]   It would be at the top amazon does the same thing on its platform. Well, everybody does it, but if you're supposed to be
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.900]   An agnostic search engine
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.900]   Whoever said that they were
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.140]   Whoever said that they were how they had to be
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.620]   That's interesting. Yeah, good point
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:55.580]   You know, it's any competitive because if you have an issue, you know, and this is by the way how this case came up is that
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.460]   a couple of pretty tiny
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.580]   Shopping services went out of business because google didn't rank them highly enough
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.740]   It's been a while since I've read the details
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:10.860]   Some of them were it was really hard to tell the difference between just a link farm and the real shopping
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.460]   Well, and that was google's really crap tension is it wasn't those guys work
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.300]   They were just a link farms. They were just links to to results
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.860]   And the other medical on the business, but fine
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.540]   Anyway 2.42 billion euros
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:27.820]   Um
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.700]   And there's no further appeals. This is that's it. It's the top is done
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:35.500]   And now the EU is energized. We got them. Yeah
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.220]   Yeah
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.220]   Uh, let's see what else here
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:46.780]   They're taking the dislike button away on youtube. That was announced this morning. That's fascinating
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:51.660]   I like I'm old enough to remember when people were clamoring to have it
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:57.580]   To have the dislike button. You mean they didn't used to have it. Oh, I didn't know they didn't have it
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.860]   And then they wanted it because they said I don't want to just react to things
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:05.020]   I want to be able to say no to things, but of course then that brings out animus and bile from people
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.500]   uh like the the
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:15.020]   You know anger button on on facebook and so with experience you learn so why do you like it stacy?
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:21.980]   I like it because I think things that produce less negativity
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:27.020]   Like here's the deal. I think we're so polarized as a company or as a
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:30.140]   people
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:36.140]   Even seeing things like I feel like there's people who feel like it does something to watch these crappy videos and like downvote them
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.780]   Or be you know negative about them
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:43.260]   But I just don't think it's a signal that's being used properly
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:49.100]   Like you're not doing anything and you're just I don't know adding more tears. It's still alive on mine
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:53.580]   Although supposedly it's going away pretty quickly. There's the thumbs up. I like this
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:58.540]   And five people didn't like last week to go and said I dislike this
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.140]   Um
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.140]   I don't even know I think you're right
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:06.220]   You know the the only time that I can really remember the dislike button being used
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:12.380]   Was on google's own google youtube rewind youtube rewind. Yeah, because it was so much more
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:20.300]   That's the thing people will go in and like do these campaigns to downvote that's part of the problem, isn't it? Yeah
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:28.380]   Vaccines, you know, uh downvote downvote. So look this is the rewind 2018. It had three million
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.980]   likes and 19 million dislikes
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.740]   And I think it was so embarrassing because google hired will smith
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:41.100]   And it was so embarrassing that google never did another rewind in fact they announced this year
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.180]   They were gonna do it again. Yeah
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.460]   So maybe that's why they got rid of the dislike. I think it also
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:51.020]   Facebook doesn't have a down thumbs down. They had to have an anger
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:57.900]   uh button and and part of the facebook the how can documents was that uh the the anger button got more
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.900]   um
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:05.500]   Juice than the the thumbs up, but what I just listened to a great mic mastic podcast
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.580]   um
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:12.140]   Just today that said well, but they didn't say in the media reports were number one that
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.580]   All the other like ones got more juice because they were new buttons
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:22.460]   Uh and number two when they discovered that that the anger button was getting too much juice. They reduced it to like zero they fixed it
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.940]   um, but
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.860]   I think if you give people the opportunity to express negative feelings
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:34.620]   Uh, there must be finding that it that it it has other impact
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:40.780]   So go to if they learn fine, but if all we can do is like things like it was stacy. We got to be grumpy sometimes, right?
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.660]   I there's two things on this. There's the
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.940]   creators perspective and there's a consumer's perspective or content consumer perspective
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:55.580]   As a creator sometimes it's nice to have those signals to see what's working and what's not working
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:01.900]   So you can make sure you're putting the content out there that not only your existing audience enjoys but potentially
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.460]   growing audience can enjoy and
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:06.140]   from a
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.980]   Viewers perspective. I like to have that button. So I'm not recommended
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:17.180]   Stuff that I'm not interested in the same way Netflix works for me. What if what if yelp what if or uh
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:20.780]   Amazon reviews took out the negatives
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:24.300]   That would be a problem
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.780]   So much bad stuff. This is this is just a fast like indicator
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:36.060]   And it can be used to game things so easily like if you really dislike something you will leave a comment lemme let me assure you that
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:43.500]   But who reads youtube comments? I believe they mentioned that a button will still be available privately for the creator to see
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:50.380]   What are clicking that they don't like it? It's just not necessarily showing up publicly is
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:55.180]   19 million people disliked it versus oh so okay, so the button's still there
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:59.260]   You just won't be able to see the count and the creators will be able to track this
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:02.860]   That's we were ponding in without knowing gosh. Oh
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.140]   dislike
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.300]   But that's useful that's useful stuff
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:11.020]   Exactly why I don't like this show
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:17.980]   You know what wait, you know why I don't like this show because you're not helping me with my phone
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:25.660]   Wait a minute. We were supposed to help Stacy with her pixel six. Did you get the what color did you get first of all?
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:27.500]   This is most important
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.420]   Okay, see foam with the fancy see phone and I got our insurance the rain back
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:34.940]   I went with the white and you got white so we get all three colors. What did you get to jeff?
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:38.940]   Oh, well, I will be getting some white black. That's why I thought black
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:42.700]   Because you know it get black what I wear. You know and we get black that heart
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:46.540]   um, so what is the pro so
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:49.260]   You have an existing and right phone
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:55.820]   I have an existing and right phone. So the finger thing the process is set up which was I thought very good
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:01.260]   Revolve connecting a usbc cable to the old phone. Mm-hmm very quickly copied everything over
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:07.340]   I thought that was a very easy way to set up. Yeah. Yeah, they've gotten rid of uh, you know, it's too bad because the sam san
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:11.500]   Uh flip for instance uses the fingerprint reader on the
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:19.100]   I really like that feature and I prefer a fingerprint reader face ID in the day and age of masks
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:24.620]   But what is the problem with it? So people been complaining about the fingerprint reader, but actually I found it to be quite
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:27.340]   I found it to be I said
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:32.620]   Okay, so the big problem is if you're not paying attention
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:37.740]   You it's fussy about you got to really hit it the right place that they're and the right pressure
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.660]   And you actually have to put pressure on it. That's what i'm fine. And there's a half the feed back. Yeah, the pressure is
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:46.780]   Yeah, I turned off my haptic feedback. So oh that's gonna make it hard. That's gonna make it
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.180]   I
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:55.900]   Hate having haptic when I touched my phone because I hate my phone like having this like it's like touching like a seer shouldn't or something
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:52:00.140]   Yeah, it's alive. Yeah, um, okay, so
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:03.340]   Seerchin phone
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:11.340]   But both both are out in marriage of fully complaining about the unpredictability of the fingerprint. I haven't found that issue but
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:17.660]   Let's say I'm hanging out here. Okay, every time I'm doing stuff. It's like so I'm in the google
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:23.580]   Like I'm hanging out in google for now. And I want to I want to get back to the home screen
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:30.300]   Oh, I it's hard. It's too hard. Okay. That's okay. You have a sucky case
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:34.060]   That's the problem the case the lip of the case is preventing that
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.500]   So this is not hard if you can really get it from the bottom
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.580]   But I think your case is the problem. Now. Here's the good news
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:44.460]   You can turn those button it is the google case
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:50.460]   It looks like a case. Oh, well, then I take it back. No, this is the okay. See look here's the g on the back
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:55.580]   Case yeah, yeah, yeah, this that's been doesn't make a difference without the case today. See
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:53:00.140]   Right without the case. Oh, yeah, I without the but I can't not have a case
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:03.260]   Good news. Good news. You can change
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.300]   You can put the buttons back if you like the
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.180]   Yeah, I do not like
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:15.180]   Button me. I do not like the gesture navigation. So I put the three buttons back
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.780]   So if you just go to the settings menu and type in navigation
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:24.620]   It'll take you to the gesture menu and you can disable gestures and get three buttons back
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:29.420]   I haven't used the gesture navigation since it came out umpteen years ago
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.300]   Yes, and I like it, but it's nice to have the choice. You have the choice
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:36.780]   I like the gesture thing, but I it doesn't work with that case very well. Yeah
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.940]   Well, isn't that that's it?
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.780]   It's partly why I don't really care for I quill
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.620]   That's not one of the reasons, but I don't like iOS because of the gestures
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:47.340]   And you don't get the choice in iOS to go to the buttons right
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:51.980]   You have no home screen like it used to have or home button. That's right
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.620]   What buttons what three buttons?
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:54:01.420]   The back recent and home button you serious, you know, I don't I haven't had those buttons at age
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.500]   Well, that's right, but you could put them there if you wanted them
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:07.180]   You see them at the bottom of my screen people don't care. See those three buttons
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:11.260]   It takes up a little screen real estate, but this screen is so big. I don't think that matters so much
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:14.220]   So navigations are all of them
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.220]   Oh
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:21.820]   Oh, because y'all have the pros and it's under system and gestures. I found it
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:25.820]   Yeah, and thank you so much for explaining this to me. I hope my pleasure
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.300]   Is there an over the shoulder?
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.300]   Somewhere we can yeah, there we go
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:34.620]   So under system navigation you can have gesture navigation, which is what Stacy was complaining about
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:42.060]   Swipe up swipe left swipe right or you can go back to three but kids love that from what I didn't tell then you then you'll have back
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:45.100]   Home and recent
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.780]   I like the gesture on and see if that helps. Oh, it should
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:55.980]   Are the own one but yeah on this one they changed the gesture Stacy the other thing is they changed gesture with the newest android
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:59.500]   version they did and I complained about that last week because I was
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:06.620]   That's like there's also I don't know if this will help you because it sounds like the one that you're having trouble with his swipe up
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:13.340]   But there is a sensitivity in the gesture settings. There's also sensitivity that you can change it, but that's for the back
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:16.460]   Sensitivity so left edge right edge not the bottom edge
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:19.580]   I'm not sure why they don't give you something for the bottom edge
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:25.340]   But I guess mainly because you often are moving around in the screen with the left and the right it's part of the
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:29.980]   Part of the thing. It's funny because I for years use a third party launcher
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.180]   Yeah, um, I like action launcher
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.180]   I know of a launcher. You know it was great
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:39.500]   I've paid for both of those and I'm just using the pixel launcher. I guess I'll survive
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:44.220]   It does it's not quite as flexible or as features rich, but
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:48.060]   At least it's it's you want another stupid stacey question sure
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:51.340]   It's not stupid. This is for the whole thing my department
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:55.420]   This dot. Yeah, what the heck is it?
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.060]   A dot
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:02.380]   You mean the camera? It's a whole punch is that the camera? Yeah, this is a selfie camera. Yeah
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:06.140]   Okay, now i'm done. They don't have a notch anymore
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:07.580]   Well, you might not
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:13.420]   And they might see at some point a colored dot like a I think it's a green dot when your mike or camera are on they put a little dot
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:15.420]   Up there to let you know that
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:20.300]   And android so that was a good feature. I really like that. I like that. Yeah apple does that like go google
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.100]   Yeah
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:26.300]   Oh, so the cameras behind the screen in the class. I just don't pay attention to cameras because I don't take selfies
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:29.740]   But that's just me. Yeah selfies are overrated
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:35.820]   Thank you so much. I know that was like we're glad to hell in your grandma how to work her phone, but
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:38.700]   Oh, I also do this on this show all the time
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:46.620]   Ask for help. I can do it more on windows weekly a poor paul thoratigo pepaul. I don't understand. How does windows work?
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:49.260]   I know i'm getting
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:56.780]   Apple's gonna have to change the way this will be very interesting in the long remember epic
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:00.220]   Who does fortnight sued both apple and google saying
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:04.220]   We want to be able to have our own payment options and not give you the 30
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:06.060]   Vig
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:10.460]   That was the one piece of the case that apple lost to epic they want everything else a judge
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:17.660]   Uh today or actually I guess it was yesterday ordered apple to fix it by december 9th apple
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:22.300]   And said please your honor give us a little more time apple says they'll appeal which means
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:27.340]   This could go on for you. Yours is still there's thumbing through all of the notes
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:32.380]   Uh, but I suspect that even with the appeal apple might have to do something by uh
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:37.180]   By december a judge against all us rogers kind of slapped him around
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:43.660]   They said she said apple's motion is based on a selective reading of this court's findings and ignores all the findings
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.620]   Which supported the injunctions. She was a little miffed
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:54.700]   Uh, this will be the first time according to apple attorney mark perry apple has ever allowed live links in an app for digital content
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:59.340]   It's going to take months to figure out the engineering economic business and others
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:05.820]   They have to it's exceedingly complicated. There have to be guardrails and guidelines
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:10.380]   Protect the children think of the children and they're just going to add a semicolon at the end
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:13.660]   It's not hard. It really is. It's not that hard. It's just a button
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:17.820]   Please and you don't even and guess what apple you don't even have to do it
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:22.780]   That developers in the apple do it apple. You just have to let them all right. How hard is that?
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:30.860]   They have to be written into guidelines that can be explained and enforced in a plot your other
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:33.340]   things i beg of you
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:36.460]   I look forward to december 9th. Yeah
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:40.060]   But remember at google oh by the way
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.580]   Tim cook the CEO of apple gave google a little gift
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:46.220]   Uh earlier this week
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:52.620]   When asked, uh, you know, apple's been on this campaign. They did it in europe and cook was doing it too in an interview
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:54.140]   I think with usa today
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:57.900]   He's you know, they said oh if we if we allow third-party app stores on the phone
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:05.260]   It just gives the criminals, you know access. Tim cooks it. Look you want a third party store buy an android phone. Mm
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.820]   Just buy an
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:12.860]   And all the android sales goes up. I well it was a little gift
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:20.460]   I don't think it has to be that black and white mr. Cook criminals already know that though. Yeah quite frankly
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:26.220]   Yeah, well, that's what uh one more thing about the pixel phone and then that's not like please no no no never stuff
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:30.860]   No, this is all all have double questions. Next week never stop. Well, these aren't these are questions
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:36.460]   I just want to make it note that this phone is really freaking heavy. Yes. It is compared to the previous models
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:38.540]   Is it really noticeably? Uh, have you oh yeah
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.100]   Yeah, it is like this is this that's that's the battery. I can play it
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.340]   That does it watch?
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.460]   Yeah, mine. Okay. I have an ad heat yet. So
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:53.340]   I thought oh crap. This phone is really hot in the first couple of days
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:58.700]   I don't know it was indexing or something it hasn't been bad since but the first couple of days it was hot
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:04.060]   I haven't had that yet and that also when it's hot means battery life's gonna be the point because it's wasting energy
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.380]   But I think the battery life is very good. It is I've gone all
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:16.700]   Day all day it may also have been hot because I was in Mexico and it was doing a lot of seeking one of the nice things about
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.020]   The pixel what's exactly is it has an e-sim
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:23.740]   So google phi was on the e-sim which meant I could put a Verizon sim in here and have both
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:27.500]   Really all the networks between Verizon and google phi
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:31.180]   So that was nice because data was spotty everywhere
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:36.380]   I found a 5g spot in Santa Rosa nice and how is it working?
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.380]   Oh, I didn't see much difference
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.380]   To download some movies
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:45.500]   You could you could go through your bandwidth in seconds wait a minute. That says 5g on this phone now
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:49.020]   Oh, I see that all the time. I believe it was in Santa Rosa. That's all the place I've seen
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.420]   Who are you real 5g or is it a c5g?
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:56.380]   Man, yeah, you're getting T-Mobile 5g and that's you know, it's mid band or low band
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:00.860]   I think it's low band 5g. It's not it's not mm. It's not millimeter wave
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.740]   Um, nobody's got that around here
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:09.820]   Verizon's doing it in 28 and 34. Where did T-Mobile do theirs?
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.940]   Mm-hmm
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.940]   No one knows never mind. Nope
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:18.860]   That was a question. I'll go back to asking about cameras on my phone. Yeah, you go
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:21.340]   Sometimes you're so smart. They see you
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:28.700]   You're talking about the frequencies. I take it. Yes. Yes. I'm talking about yes the frequency
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.820]   So sorry, Verizon's is the frequency. Yeah, 28
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:38.300]   All right, okay, let's talk about other things. Did you want to know anything else?
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:42.060]   I might come across a thing or two
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:50.060]   You've got the the experts you actually should go on all about Android. That's that would be fun. That's why oh, that's true. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.060]   An idiot discovers the pixel
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:57.900]   Stay tuned stay stay. Yes, Jason and michael all kinds of questions
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.940]   so um
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:05.020]   You remember this is prior to aunt and stacy, but you remember
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:09.180]   Jeff that I was in vane for a long time against amp
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:15.420]   Thinking it was really an hour. Oh, yes. I remember how our grab by google
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.260]   um
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:25.100]   And now I think we're starting to learn both from the unredacted complaint from the texas ag and and elsewhere that amp may not have been the
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.660]   innocent
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:34.460]   Improvement on web technologies that we uh, we were told is this sure I told you so moment. Yes. Oh, okay
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:37.020]   I told you so there you go. That's that's what we need to hear
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.660]   I told you so uh during
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.660]   The chrome dev some summit concluded last week
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.500]   uh
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.700]   Paul Kinlan who's lead for chrome developer relations
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:53.180]   Was speaking during and asked me anything q&a with chrome leadership
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.420]   former amp advisory board member jeremy keith
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:00.380]   asked a question
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:08.300]   Given the court proceedings against amp he said why should anyone trust flock or any which is google's, you know
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.020]   Federated learning of cohort
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:17.180]   Cookie sandbox right or any other google initiatives ostensibly focused on privacy
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:23.740]   Uh ben gallbraith from the chrome leadership said well, I can't comment about the amp proceedings
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.740]   But let's talk about privacy sandbox
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:30.300]   I think it's important to know we're not asking for blind trust with a sandbox effort
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:35.980]   Instead we're working in the open it means we're sharing ideas while they're in the early phase
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.460]   We're I don't know a lot of stuff
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:41.020]   We're transparent
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.020]   He said we're transparent
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:46.060]   But I think it's very telling
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:48.940]   Uh that he was faced with that fairly tough question
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:52.780]   Why should we trust you and really didn't make much of a argument?
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:57.500]   Uh, why we should trust them did you have you read the stuff about amp?
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:03.740]   Um, I didn't really dig into it and and depth because it's also kind of losing steam anyway
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:09.820]   Amp is you know, uh, in fact google's own internal documents according to this unsealed
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.460]   uh
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:16.540]   Lawsuit show that amp pages brought 40 less
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:21.020]   revenue to publishers, which might be a recent slipsing theme
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.900]   um
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:27.420]   And this one is really now again. This is an allegation
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:31.420]   This has not been proven in court. This just although it was a very I thought a very well
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:36.300]   argued and uh, and um, there was a lot of evidence in this
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.940]   pleading this speed this is from the
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:46.060]   The uh lawsuit the speed benefits google marketed for amp or also at least partly a result of google's throttling
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:50.620]   Whoops google throttles the load time of non amp ads by giving them
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:57.260]   artificial one second delays in order to give amp a quote nice comparative
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.420]   boost
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:01.740]   Well, well, hold on there. Hold on. Hold on
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:08.380]   What I don't know. I don't know the details here. This is part of the google's own documents by the way
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.700]   Yes, part of the area. I read the time was that
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:17.260]   amp forced publishers to speed up their editorial content, but the ad content remained
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:20.860]   horrible and so um
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:25.820]   There was an argument at the time that google should
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:33.420]   Advantage faster ads now so you could say did they did they throttle down the slow ones or throttle up the fast ones?
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:38.300]   Apparently they throttle down non amp ads by a second to make amp look good
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:45.980]   Plus and this is also from the the lawsuit throttling non amp ads slows down header bidding
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:49.180]   Which then google uses that's another issue. Yeah
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:52.220]   To denigrate header bidding for being too slow
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:57.580]   Google really it really looks like and a lot of this is coming from internal documents
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.740]   So it's kind of hard to argue that oh we didn't do that
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:06.700]   Uh google really did a lot to favor if you want to go after google go after their position and add networks
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.420]   That's that's where they're voting the shopping thing amp
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:15.660]   That's all small where google's an ad network company and that's where it has its its power
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:19.500]   Well, but they used but they used it. I think it's
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.220]   their issue
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:27.660]   the issue also anytime a big company that has a huge share in the market who
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.660]   Advantages their own technology or I mean in this sort of way
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.100]   I mean that's just self-dealing and even if it's not a big deal
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:41.260]   It's something that should be stopped simply to like prevent corruption and antitrust. Yeah, anyway
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:43.900]   um
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.980]   Yeah
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:47.900]   Look I love google
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:51.900]   We wouldn't be doing a show called this week in google if we didn't think they were important and there were stuff of interest
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.980]   We've been doing this show for 10 years and as there's always been a a matter of great interest
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:00.620]   We use a lot of google stuff. Mm-hmm. Um, I want google to do the right thing
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.820]   They don't think they need to do the wrong thing. They make plenty of money. They don't need
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:11.260]   To to cheat it's fair to challenge them. Yeah, I think it's fair to challenge them. Uh, I'm disappointed
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:15.660]   I'm a little disappointed and I think they they got aggressively competitive
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:20.540]   Look it happens in silicon valley all the time. It happens to almost every company. That's the thing
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:26.380]   I expected better. No, I shouldn't be surprised. I wouldn't be I believed them when they said don't be evil
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.620]   I really believed them that they wanted to be a better company
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:32.860]   And I think in the beginning larry and serge really did want to be a better company
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:40.380]   But nothing I also think it's the bigger you get the harder it is not to have more influence on people and to become evil
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.540]   Yes, someone. Yes
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:46.460]   What irritates me here in the case of amp itself is
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:50.140]   That they screwed up
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:57.500]   What should have been a holy cause which is to fix media's web pages the media media's web pages have gotten even worse
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:02.140]   Right, we used to we got rid of pop-ups for for a brief moment in history
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:05.180]   And then they invented all kinds of new pop-ups
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:07.820]   Partly partly just tell you it's okay to
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.460]   That you know, it's the click off for the privacy stuff
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:15.260]   But all the other stuff you have and all the stuff coming in and out media pages are terrible
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.580]   They're irritating they're slow
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.820]   They're they they move around
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:27.020]   They're awful and amp at one level was supposedly there to help speed up the web and get back to a purer web
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.780]   And that's why I was in favor of it and it did that to an extent
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:36.780]   But then it got obviously or apparently misused in other ways which then hurts the cause of a better web
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.020]   Yeah, which is a problem. Yeah
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.500]   Take a little break come back with more
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.740]   Jeff Jarvis
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:45.340]   Aunt Pruitt
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.180]   Stacy Higginbotham
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.540]   I miss serious. We were all serious. Don't say he smiled. I miss you guys
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:55.900]   Oh, well, I was caught looking at the size of my slippers because I was trying to order a new pair of slippers
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:58.860]   I
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:00.460]   Was during the ad
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:03.020]   Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So we were there
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:09.180]   We got one person that tweets all throughout the show and then someone else is
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:11.900]   buying slippers. What kind of slippers?
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:14.460]   Only turning the ad brick
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:17.180]   Yeah, I just wanted to recommend
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:21.340]   It's a christmas tradition in my house to update every year
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:24.460]   You got to get a new pair of wicked good slippers from LL Bean
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.460]   That's what I'm getting. I knew it
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:30.860]   How did I know that?
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:34.460]   I just somehow knew that
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:37.260]   I just had a feeling. I'm just
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:41.180]   I was hoping for buddies. I was so hoping for funnies
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:46.220]   Now you got to get a quality slipper when you're up in the Pacific Northwest
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.020]   Yeah, but you got it
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:51.820]   The only bad thing about wicked good slippers as good as they are is you do really have to buy a new one every year a new pair
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:56.220]   Every year because they we buy them every like two years. It's a traditional christmas gift
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:01.260]   Oh man, I think my son has a pair of those here wicked good wicked wicked good
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:04.060]   So I imagine the report house. It's oh
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:06.700]   Slippers. Yeah
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.900]   No, but I managed so last year I got them with kitty cats on them
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:15.340]   So I managed to dress it up a little bit so that it looks a little bit like i'm thinking about oh geez
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.620]   You know, thank you so much slippers
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.780]   How did you know?
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:22.780]   I was hoping for
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:26.140]   Let me see. I don't know if it was a special thing
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:30.620]   Oh, I have a I have a choice of plaids, but that's it
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:34.780]   Yeah, no, these were really grabbed. They don't see them anymore now. I used to get these
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:38.700]   I don't like them. You got to get the moccasin ones. I think my personally my
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.740]   Oh, yeah, they were the wicked good clogs
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:45.820]   Oh, yeah, no clogs. No, but they had but they had cats on them
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:50.380]   Yeah, I don't know maybe uh, I got a call mr. Bean
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.020]   and see what's going on because uh

[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.420]   See that yeah, I guess they don't have the uh
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.300]   kitty cats anymore and they only one color

[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:12.140]   Thank you akamai for your support and this week in google
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:16.940]   And uh, thank you twig listeners for using that address so they know you sign here
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:20.540]   Another good sponsor and I just know didn't know that
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:26.700]   That in the ad the akamai they were scrolling through l.o.p and slippers in that ad no
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:32.620]   Okay, that's creepy. Is that a glitch in the matrix? That's a glitch in the matrix. I think that's a glitch in the matrix
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:39.580]   I'm packing up a gong we are in a simulation. It's obvious
[01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:45.580]   Take it real musk was right don't kill us elon don't kill us
[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:50.940]   I'm not worried about elon. I'm worried about paul gozer actually, but that's another story for another day
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.580]   Uh
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:17:02.220]   So amazon not gonna derail anything else. Let's talk about it. No, that was interesting though. That was uh, I'm telling you good. I
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:08.220]   There's coincidences and then there's glitches in the matrix and then there's tre- then there's conspiracies
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:13.980]   I think there's just not enough bits and so sometimes they have to duplicate the bits
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.060]   Right
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:19.340]   They couldn't they couldn't have something different. They just ran out of bits
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:23.900]   I'm scared now. I'm saying did you take the blue pillow the red bill?
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:27.020]   Um, there was a pill
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.380]   Did you see the matrix?
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:35.260]   What does what does updating the verges background policy mean sacy?
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:43.180]   Wait, oh, I like this story. So the verge published a thing saying hey, we're ethical. This is how we're trying to be ethical
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:45.340]   And it's all about
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:51.020]   On background, which is what companies do when they want to tell you information that they want you to print
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:56.700]   But they don't want to be credited with it. It's kind of a way of of manipulating them the story. It's waffily
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:02.380]   Yeah, I think it's worse than that. I think it's spin it is it true. It is spin
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:03.260]   so
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:04.380]   when a
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:11.020]   And the thing is it used to be for like true sources like I used to have people who you know
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:17.020]   And sometimes those people did work for competitors and but sometimes people will go on background because they want you to have
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:19.980]   Context for something but they don't want to be it
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:24.860]   You have it. Yeah, sometimes could be informational, but but it's really up to the reporter to
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:28.140]   Sift through the spin to get to the facts
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:32.780]   And it is your responsibility when someone gives you something on background. You don't just print it
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.260]   You go check it out. Yeah, but anyway
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:42.700]   So what happens is spokespeople from companies tend to go on background to tell you things like I'll I'll say something about like
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:48.460]   We'll just use amazon because they do this a lot. Okay, talk about like yeah product
[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:52.940]   This product is behaving weird or actually I've gotten this
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:19:00.460]   Like this product is behaving weird and I don't understand why it's doing this and they're like well on background
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:03.740]   We're gonna issue an update, but you can't we print that
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:06.860]   Or can you
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:11.260]   Can you say I've been told by company sources? No, you can't even say that you can say
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:12.620]   Oh boy
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.420]   I
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:20.300]   I found that or I hear there's going to be a back like an update. I've heard but yeah, it's kind of weird
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:25.340]   Those are the vertices more than one big company and I know one big company in particular
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:30.700]   That does this insists on holding product briefings on background with no attribution
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:37.100]   Which means no one can properly report what company executives say about their own new products during marketing events
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.580]   We know exactly what company does that
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:41.900]   Uh
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.740]   A big tech company PR person emailed us. This is just stupid
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:49.420]   Email us a link to the company's own website on background
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.500]   That's just dope
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.140]   That's just useless. That's like that person just as useless
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:56.540]   A food company
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:00.460]   Food delivery company system on discussing the popularity of chicken wings on background
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.460]   I
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:07.580]   Don't by the way, this is one of the reasons actually one of the primary reasons
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:14.140]   I never talked to PR people because I don't I don't it's like I don't want to I don't want to have to sift through that in my head
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:16.540]   It's easier for me not to know it
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:23.180]   Then to figure out if it's if it's guff or if it's genuine valuable stuff and as a result
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.740]   I miss out app. I don't do apple briefings
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:29.500]   So I miss out on a lot of uh, maybe some factual stuff here
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:32.220]   But I also miss out on a lot of fluff
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:35.980]   Yeah, I get a lot of fluff, but there's probably
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:41.020]   Four PR people that I really enjoy here in front of me
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:44.620]   And so this is important to it. I don't have a policy for you
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:47.900]   You get to do whatever you want Jason gets to do whatever he wants Mike
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:49.580]   He gets to do whatever they want
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:53.180]   I have just because I've been in this business so way too long and I'm too old and cranky
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:56.780]   I just I don't I don't like loners. I don't want to talk to PR
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:01.740]   I've spent way too many hours at lunches with people who just don't want to do that anymore
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:07.980]   Yeah, and let's see. That's the thing. I'm pretty much right there with you the four PR people that I have the ones
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.540]   They they know all right aunt's gonna dig this
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:14.620]   Here we go. This is the information and as a result and and it works
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:15.740]   Yeah, and I get the benefit
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:16.140]   Thanks
[01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:20.940]   If having you mica and Jason around because you guys do that all right and I don't have to deal with it
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.700]   Because I hate embargoes
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:23.980]   I don't do bargoes
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:26.700]   And I need to end the A's I haven't done them in more than a decade
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:28.780]   They're so hard especially
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:34.220]   Most reporters don't do NDAs. I mean, I've never signed an NDA
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:38.140]   Even like sometimes when you show up to a company they're like sign a idea. You're like hi. I'm with the media
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:43.420]   I'm not gonna do that. I don't take questions. I don't I mean I don't say I'll submit questions to you
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:47.580]   I don't let them know what yeah questions. I'm gonna ask I don't take the questions they suggest
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:50.140]   What about clearing this is a different this is a cultural difference
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:55.500]   A clearing quotes. Yes. They don't have to do no because tell I say we won't do that
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:59.660]   But in Germany it is standard procedure. Yeah to call and clear the quotes
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:04.540]   I don't think it's unreasonable if you are quoting somebody to call not to clear them
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:07.020]   Just to make sure you're quoting it accurately because you've got you
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.060]   I think it's absolutely right to get this did I get this right? Yes
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:15.420]   But in this day of digital recording is that even necessary people record phone calls and
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:19.260]   Conversations on some type of digital recorder all the time, right?
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:23.580]   And it gives them the opportunity to change it when they realize they said something stupid. Yeah
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:27.500]   Yeah, you never want to clear quotes with people if you can avoid it
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:30.300]   And you can absolutely avoid it
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:36.300]   Um, I will call people and run by for clarification if I haven't done it in an interview
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:40.220]   Yeah, and I'm gonna use like a metaphor because you know, it's tech reporting someone
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:42.460]   It's like when you have a stack of pancakes, you know
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:45.500]   I'll run my metaphor by them sometimes just to make sure that it's
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.140]   Decent
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:50.140]   You clear the metaphor
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:52.300]   Said pancakes
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:57.420]   This is what's different about what we do from what you do jeff because when you're doing tech reporting
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:02.860]   You're what you're what you primary part of your job is communicating complex stuff to and do non
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:09.500]   Non-technical so you break it down. So you'd use metaphors and you want to just make sure you're not using a metaphor that's misrepresenting
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:13.980]   Yeah, the actual technical so pixels are like a waffle like it here's there we go
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:19.420]   I actually use baking a lot like when I talk about semiconductor manufacturing
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:22.780]   I'm like semiconductor manufacturing. It's like baking a layer cake. Oh, yeah
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:27.820]   Batch a cake that you just tell some of it that you put more frosting in you just don't want to make
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:31.820]   Same metaphor that makes sense to you, but in fact doesn't is misrepresented. Yes
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:34.780]   I say it's more like a Napoleon
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:38.060]   They were lasagna sometimes
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:44.940]   Sometimes cyber security is notorious for this sometimes you come up with the metaphor that you think rocks and then they're like well
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:49.900]   No, it's more like a lot of times when I'm doing this. I'm not doing this with the PR person
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.740]   I'm doing it with like the tech people. Okay, look our goal is the same
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:59.740]   Which is we want to accurately communicate the information without without fear of favor and
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:03.820]   So to the degree that you want to be accurate. I think it's appropriate to ask
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:10.780]   But we don't want to give them the chance to say no, please don't say that because that would hurt my feelings or my boss would get mad
[01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:12.860]   Yeah, now this one
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:18.380]   A lot more. Oh, yeah, they're coming in like they're empowered, baby. Oh, yeah. I have people in my interviews
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:20.300]   They're like hey, can you take that off the record? I hate that
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:23.500]   I don't hate
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.500]   If I may have a historic moment
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:29.740]   Um, I was a people magazine when that shift occurred
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:35.580]   The people magazine started it was all about the top stars and then and then the top shows and if you had a
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:39.660]   Dallas is number one you put Dallas in the cover Dallas cells and then one day
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:44.060]   I remember that my boss screaming down the hall because I was the tv critic tv's dead charters
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.340]   dead
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:51.020]   Because the cover had the soul because now we had more competition because now what matter was the event in the stars life
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:54.780]   And so the flak became uber important
[01:24:55.740 --> 01:25:00.380]   Because now we needed the stars face to sell the magazine and the flak to do that
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:03.980]   And so they would say no, no, no, we want a reporter approval
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.740]   Quote approval photo approval
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:11.500]   Uh cover guarantee all this stuff and they threw their way around quite a bit because they could because
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:16.060]   They controlled the commodity that matter we control the commodity matter the old days the audience
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:21.580]   Now to get the audience we needed the commodity they controlled which was the access to the star
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:27.100]   Is it okay for these people to say off the record versus on background?
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:31.580]   Is i'm assuming there's a nuance difference there. I'm not a journalist. So that's why i'm asking
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:34.220]   Yeah, do you do off the record stuff Stacey? You do don't you?
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:36.060]   I do
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:38.380]   only for people I know and trust
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:42.620]   Right. Okay. And again same thing and even then I bet you limited to
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:48.540]   Yeah, sir. What do you think is a legitimate let me ask this Stacy? What's the legitimate use of off the record?
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:53.500]   I have had people try to get me to like investigate like
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:59.340]   Pay disparities or like treatment issues when deep throat meets you in a garage
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:02.380]   And says you really need to follow the money
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:06.460]   Well, like if someone tells you something and they're gonna give you like internal memos
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:10.780]   Sometimes if they're like HR memos, I will take those off the record
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:12.540]   um
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:18.140]   Or in those cases I will run like things like quote approvals by them because like this is
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:20.860]   Personnel thing there
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:24.380]   Yeah, there are things you need more careful of I think that's smart. Yeah
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:30.460]   So you can be off the record if you're a valid source in putting you on the record hurts you
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:34.780]   Here's a challenging one and this is another one the verge brings up multiple big tech companies
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:38.300]   And I would say this is common practice in politics and other areas too
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:43.820]   Insist on having pr staffers quoted as quote sources familiar with the situation
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.780]   Even though they're paid spokespeople
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:48.940]   Yeah
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:52.300]   Politicians do this all the time too in regulatory agency
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:58.460]   So that's something that I was like stunned at when I first started reporting about politics, but it's correct into
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:01.580]   Tech
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:04.620]   Yeah, it's super stupid super frustrating
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:08.540]   And the only reason people do it is for access
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:11.180]   Yeah
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:13.420]   Um, so what is their new policy anyway?
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:16.860]   It's actually worth reading if even if you're not a journalist
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:19.660]   I I would suggest going to the verge.com and reading this
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:23.740]   Because it's interesting to hear all the manipulations that tech companies
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:27.420]   More than ever have started using
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:30.140]   Um, we we covered a story
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:32.940]   Remember the the car company that said
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:38.780]   Uh, we're gonna only what do they say? We're only gonna do electric vehicles from now and I can't remember what it was
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:44.700]   Oh the vaults the vaults wagon, but they were gonna rename themselves from vogue swag and devolt swag
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.540]   Oh, yeah
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:47.500]   It was April 1st
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:54.620]   They mentioned this a major car company's head of communications told us an april fools joke was actually real on background
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:59.260]   So that was the sneaky thing on background the joke obviously
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:02.380]   Was a joke it wasn't real
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:07.420]   Um, but on background so this that's nasty stupid. That's nasty
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:12.140]   When people do like what are you gonna do with that? You're like, oh, well, we're gonna believe him
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.620]   And then you're gonna get bit
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:17.740]   So by the way, this is a really good use of
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:21.580]   Sorry, I'm looking at twitter right now. I hope you'll forgive me for this. No, it's okay
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:25.100]   We know you've already tweeted about six times during the show i've counted
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:28.940]   If you go to top articles and then go to conversation
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:33.500]   The first thing under my list is the verge policy and you get really good tweets
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.220]   Yep, that are very relevant to that discussion
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:39.580]   I think this is a great use for twitter. This is an improved twitter
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:42.220]   Uh, I'm glad that they're doing this
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:48.540]   Any way, tony hale on by the way, no what we i'd love to maybe we didn't learn in years gone by we probably have yeah
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:52.460]   Um, so this is what the verge is saying. This is bad
[01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:56.300]   So we're going to reset these expectations as loudly as possible
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:29:03.340]   This is really a message to the tech companies and their pr firms from now on the default for communications professionals and people speaking to the verge
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:09.260]   In an official capacity will be on the record do it no more background no more off the record
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:10.460]   No, read the next paragraph
[01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:13.180]   But we will still honor some requests to be on background
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:18.940]   But at our discretion and only for specific reasons that we can articulate to read it should have been the case always
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:25.420]   Things should be the case in journal. I think what happens is you just kind of gradually fall into this because you're a person
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:29.420]   And these are people and you want to be nice to people and that's why i don't talk to it
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:31.900]   Because I don't want to be nice. These reporters hard
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.220]   I don't want honestly
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:36.860]   I'm a people pleacher and if I know these people
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:39.660]   It's bad for me because i'll try i'll
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:43.260]   I can't criticize microsoft there. I like that guy
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:48.860]   I love chris capisella and but I you know, that's the problem. He's their chief marketing officer
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:50.220]   He's a great guy
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:53.420]   But I don't want to let that make me be nice to microsoft
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:57.180]   That good journalist paul tharats have really and marigio for a really good example
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:01.820]   Yeah, they know all these people and they are completely willing to be very critical of
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:06.300]   Microsoft. I really respect that. Yeah, when when I started entertainment weekly
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:09.500]   I tried to have a policy, but I didn't last long enough to keep it in place
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:13.020]   I tried to have a policy that would forbade critics from doing features
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:19.740]   On stars and productions because they were to be an independent critic there as the eyes and voice that's fair the audience
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:23.900]   Not to become buddy buddy with the stars, but it didn't work
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:27.340]   Uh, so after I left it, you know, it all gets
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:34.540]   incestuous as hell so this this new policy was written by ny life at tell and I could just see you know, you're knowing him very well
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:38.700]   I could just see him finally. You're right. Yeah, and just getting so fed up with this
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:43.580]   That he finally said look i'm writing this and you're publishing it and this is our new policy
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.980]   Done
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:49.500]   But you know, that's I have to say this has been our policy here
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:55.420]   Since day one has been my policies since I started doing this in the 90s. I don't do background. I'm doing any of this stuff
[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:59.740]   I don't do off the that's you but do your employees have like
[01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:02.780]   I found it interesting that you said you didn't have like a company
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:06.940]   You don't tell them what to do, but I feel like I trust that the organization has to have a stand
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:11.500]   I'm very clear to them about what I do and that that is kind of the ethos of what we do
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:16.540]   And I trust them to do it right. We you know if if we were a bigger organization
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:18.540]   There's only four of us staff
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:20.860]   Hosts if we were a bigger organization
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:28.300]   Certainly we did detect tv jim ladderback wrote up a very clear policy. I completely respect and still adhere to
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:34.140]   Um, but I but I trust them and if ever by the way, I free and you'll do a vouch for this
[01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:37.820]   And if I think there's been a if a line's been crossed, I will let them know. Yep
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:43.340]   I will you you're not going for scoops as much as commentary and content as well as miss
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:45.740]   We can do yeah
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:47.740]   The reason we can do this
[01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:51.580]   Is because we have no we don't we're not publishing three months as fans
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:56.220]   You know and we so we don't and we're not uh, and but that's by the way where we don't have
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:32:05.020]   Well, I can't say we always don't I don't ever have advanced products. I know sometimes Jason frances. I'm six on embargo
[01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:10.460]   Um, I don't want to I don't want to get in the way of his ability to do what he considers to be his job
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:13.660]   And he and we're certainly forthright about that when that happens
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:18.940]   After the fact when Jason during our pixel six announcement goes, oh and I have one
[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:22.860]   We're very clear. Oh, you have had this for five days and it's a main blah blah blah
[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:25.100]   um
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:26.700]   Yeah, I just
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:29.980]   That comes more from my point of view that this is not a
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:37.660]   Uh, this is not a traditional editorial entity where you know, I'm the boss or and we have employees
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:43.020]   But I think of it more of a collegial consortium of people and even the staff hosts
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:45.980]   I don't want to treat them any differently than I do you and jeff for instance
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:49.180]   I don't say to you stacy. Here's our policy. Don't violate it because
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:54.940]   You don't work for me. You're a contract employee and and I trust you you wouldn't be on the show
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.900]   If I thought there were going to be an issue with that. Mm-hmm
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.140]   And there's certainly have people we do not let on our air
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:04.380]   For that reason let's go say I I'm getting a kickback on every slipper sold
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:11.580]   If I thought that were true, I would I would say oh, she has a waffle empire
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:13.740]   I said let me in on
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:17.900]   No, I think people know that that's one of the things that uh
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:23.020]   Uh, but we don't I don't think we have to put it in writing. I don't know. I don't think so
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:27.500]   If I believe all of us here, we have a set of moral standards
[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:33.500]   Yeah, we don't want to be I believe the term is on the take. Yeah, we have a lot. Yeah, we have a moral
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.140]   Confice yeah
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:41.020]   Uh, I love it case you knew it and immediately picked up on that car companies
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:47.580]   Uh, yeah, misrepresentation on twitter. Yeah, you're right. This is this is a good use of twitter blue
[01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:50.940]   It really is. Yeah, especially if you follow the right people
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:53.580]   Yeah
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:59.580]   Yeah, well, let's put it if you follow the topics and people or you follow the topics that are interesting to you and the people that I mean
[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:04.860]   We think it's good because we care about this but many other people are like well and all the people film nikinson
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:07.420]   Harry macraken did her bone
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:14.300]   I mean the people who are responding this not only the people I follow but but real journalists who agree. Yes. Yeah, that's what's my command
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:16.300]   I love it showing up on the screen. Love that
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:19.020]   Um, it's making twitter be
[01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:25.420]   What I think for a lot of journalists has been for a long time, but in a much more organized and useful fashion
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:28.380]   Definitely targeted. I don't feel like i'm having a stroke when i'm reading this
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:33.420]   Um, yes, yay, finally
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:39.740]   Uh, all right good conversation of I know sometimes we get into the weeds on the media
[01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:43.020]   But I think media literacy is really important for you our audience
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:47.020]   Um, it's certainly it's tech journalism. Yeah, you need to understand
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:49.820]   And I have been kind of
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:55.020]   Invaying against the lax standards in tech journalism now for some years. It really bugs me
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:35:00.860]   Uh, I mean youtube journalists. They don't there's no there's no standard at all
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:07.260]   Well, either way too it went from it went from full utopia to full dystopia as well
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:13.260]   And and I don't trust the level of reporting and context and so much of of tech journals, but especially
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:19.180]   I don't mean I mean that actually less about tech sites and more about tech coverage in mainstream sites. Yeah
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:21.820]   Well, it's always a problem
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:26.940]   It's a problem with belt weight journalism. It's a problem. It's always a problem when you covering a niche if you're covering autos
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:31.420]   It's always a problem and there's an access and one of you want access you have to
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:37.100]   And I and it's one of the things I wanted to fight against from day one because I know people don't trust auto
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:44.380]   magazines particularly they know they're kind of in the pocket and I and I thought the probably people felt the same way about tech
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:48.540]   They do coverage. So I really wanted to emphasize. We're not that we don't do that
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:52.620]   We that's not us and we're our job is to represent you the users
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:55.500]   So that's why we talk about it here and I think it's important
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:59.020]   I hope you as listeners and to our podcast understand
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:06.780]   And maybe take that knowledge out and to be more critical about the the material you you know you read and you see because a lot of it
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:14.460]   Something that comes to my mind is with with my show hands on photography. I have spoken a lot to
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:20.460]   Canon explorer of light photographers and everybody will say oh aunt. He's a cannon fanboy
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:27.260]   Quite frankly, yes, I am a cannon fanboy, but at the same time. I also deal with folks from Sony
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:33.020]   Or whoever else that has some interesting camera technology and I'll let it all be known right up front
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:36.460]   Hey, I'm here to talk about this particular piece of tech
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:42.220]   Regardless of what my affinity is for also though. You're not we're not quite reviewers as as jeff pointed out
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:44.780]   Right. We're we're we're we're a little bit different
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:48.220]   um eric in our eric techman in our chat room says youtube
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:52.460]   Our our youtubers are content creators not sure that's correct
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:57.020]   But that's problematic to me because they're behaving as journalists. They're reporting on
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:02.620]   They're refusing see this journal. Yeah by the masses. So that's problematic to me because
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:06.620]   I don't think I don't think they have the same standards many cases not I do
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:09.180]   But in many cases they don't when I see um
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:15.100]   Linus tech tips investing in framework. Are they covering framework? Yeah, that bugs me
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:19.260]   Yeah, it's not to impune him, but it bugs me
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:23.980]   Uh that that's not anything we would ever uh contemplate or allow
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:27.740]   Hey, here's a cool story brain implants
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:31.180]   Really cool. This is from science alert
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:39.180]   brain implant translates paralyzed man's thoughts into text with 94 accuracy
[01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:45.340]   Uh this fella has been paralyzed for the neck down doing uh during due to a spinal cord injury
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:47.900]   He sustained in 2007
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:54.620]   They put a uh a device in his brain called brain gator brain computer interface interface
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:38:01.260]   They they tell the fella and we don't know his name. They call him t5 in the study 65 years old. They say
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:04.140]   Even though he can't move any of his limbs
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:10.220]   Concentrate as if you're writing think about writing in your mind even though you can't
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:15.900]   And the the the interface was able to with 94 accuracy
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:21.740]   Using ai translate those brain impulses into actual text. That's so awesome
[01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:28.700]   What scares me? Where did it was a week trapped in the bell jar like that and and to be able to communicate that way is just amazing
[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:29.740]   Yeah
[01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:36.540]   Uh, where was it? We had a question. Let me see if they say that in tests the man was able to achieve writing speeds get this
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:40.860]   Of 90 characters a minute. That's 18 words a minute
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:47.180]   with a with a uh approximately 94 accuracy and up to 99 accuracy with auto correct enabled
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:50.300]   So maybe it was weak in misunderstanding
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:52.300]   No, no, no, I didn't mean that
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:58.140]   Oh, that's interesting like and so if you're thinking about spelling a word and you would misspell it in your head and you're typing
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:03.340]   Fixes it or maybe you didn't misspell it in your head, but the ai misinterpreted
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:06.700]   Said that's an oh not a like they're in there. Yeah
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:13.420]   The autocorrect fixed it that is that speed to give you an idea 18 words a minute is they say
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:17.980]   Almost on par with the typing speed of smartphone users in that man's age group
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:21.740]   So, I mean, it's not slow. That's awesome. It's not slow
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:26.780]   It is slow, but it's not like horribly slow. That's low people my age
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:31.580]   They say get about 23 words a minute on a smartphone
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:35.260]   I I've never timed myself. Yeah
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:39.340]   Um, so that's no mavis beacon teach us typing for your smart note
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:42.780]   No, look at this is the man's imagined
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:48.540]   handwriting as interpreted by the system. So again, this is not him moving his hand
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:51.180]   These letters are him thinking
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:54.060]   These letters. It's not the game curses
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:58.380]   Um, no, I guess not that's interesting
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:05.340]   Uh just in the earlier version they had the thing where you you know, you like like your cable tv you pointed the keyboard
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:09.980]   I repeat I wonder whether thinking that you were typing would work
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:14.140]   I bet it would but they have to train it for that. Yeah, yeah
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:21.020]   This is interesting because you know how some people there's like always a small set subset of the pop population like who don't see faces
[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:25.100]   For example when they're thinking right like when I so I think
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:29.900]   I explained that apanosia apanosia apanosia or something. Yeah
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:36.700]   Well, no, this is more like like some people like they don't hear a voice in their head, but some of us do right
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:39.820]   Oh, yeah, you never know what's in your pro pros. Oh pan
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:41.900]   I see that you want to talk about that
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:44.540]   I'd say that word
[01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:50.060]   No, I I can hear no I can hear sounds I can smell smells as if they were there and vivid
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:53.100]   But I can I close my eyes. I cannot see your face. Stacy
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:56.300]   Yeah, so that's like our brains are all a little wacky
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:41:01.500]   So I'm thinking about like for people like I can't see myself
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.340]   Writing
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:05.740]   I I've been trying really hard, but I can picture
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:12.060]   Be tight like not that physical act of typing but like that words on a screen. Here's what they said when they showed the handwriting
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:14.220]   It's kind of crazy. Here's what they said
[01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:18.700]   Uh, the researcher said we've learned the brain retains its ability to prescribe
[01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:24.300]   Fine movements a full decade after the body has lost its ability to execute those movements
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:26.780]   And we would learn that complicated
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:28.780]   intended motions
[01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:33.420]   involving changing speeds and curved trajectories like handwriting
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:42.620]   Can be interpreted more easily more rapidly by the AI we're using then can simpler intended motions like moving a cursor in a straight path at a steady speed
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:47.420]   Or I would predict typing. That's just it's a it's the fine motor
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:54.140]   Thing, but you remember enough about how to write you you don't need to be I have terrible penmanship
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:59.980]   Now yeah, but I learned to type it for the sixth grade because of that the good news about AI then care about your penmanship
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:06.300]   Thank you as long as you're consistent. Here's me. Right. It could be your a looks like this consistently illegible
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:13.020]   Uh, basically the researchers say alphabetic and i'm again reading from science alert.com
[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:15.980]   Alphabetic letters are very different from one another in shape
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:20.940]   So the AI can decode the user's intention more rapidly as the characters are drawn
[01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:25.500]   Compared to other systems that don't make use of dozens of different inputs in the same way
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:28.380]   So I guess what are things like mandarin would be
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:32.300]   Because that's the characters build on that's interesting
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:37.900]   Well, maybe not though because it's very prescribed when you write a chinese character the order of the strokes
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:44.780]   Is prescribed so you in fact when I was learning how to write mandarin if you write it in the wrong order they go
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:46.140]   Oh, that's
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:51.100]   They slap your hand you have to do it in the right and you it's actually more precise than one would think
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:56.940]   I think it's actually better than english cursive. It's very you're almost a painter. It's very interesting
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:01.020]   I bet you would work better. It's fine. Yeah. Yeah, and that cool
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:04.060]   So they also say look this is one guy
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:05.820]   It's just a proof of concept
[01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:08.220]   We were able to do it that doesn't mean we're going to have a product
[01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:13.500]   That you're going to be able to use anytime soon, but the research is starting which is very interesting
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:17.020]   um
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:22.300]   So can I mention a little one that you can't play it because please you mean adele's new
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:29.340]   Yeah, what's interesting about this is that john lewis. It's not tiktok john lewis and and other british
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:31.180]   um
[01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:36.060]   Mertians always have their special christmas adverts. Yeah, and they're about two minutes long
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:41.740]   You look for here jerky, you know, it's the same thing that microsoft has a regular google has a regular christmas and
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:43.020]   apples
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:46.700]   We wait for apples christmas ad every year. So that's happens to you do
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:52.780]   Maybe you just once a little but this is a british model of telling a story and no no that's totally it
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:56.140]   Really? Yeah. Yeah, you want to see apples christmas ad from last year
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:58.780]   It's a real heart
[01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:01.900]   Tugger a real hum bigger a real hum
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:08.860]   Hummed way, but this is 2021. Oh the new ones out new ones already out. Oh, you clearly weren't waiting that much
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:11.180]   Oh, no, no, no, this is
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:14.620]   Well, this was published in 2019, but it says 2021
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:19.820]   This is youtube probably screwing with me. I'm not gonna play that one just in case
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:27.420]   Please here's one from 2013. How about that? They've been doing this for a long time
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:30.940]   apples christmas commercial cars driving up
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:37.580]   There's a kid with a iPhone. Oh, I actually I love this that I remember this one grandpa comes to the door
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:44.460]   The grandkids the kids they're all the whole family's getting together, but there's you know the usual kind of
[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:48.620]   Emo 14 year old who spends a lot of time on his phone
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:52.860]   They're all having fun building a snowman. He's on his smartphone
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:55.340]   No Ralph Ralph
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:45:00.220]   They said rather throw something Ralph because Ralph's just can't he's the christmas tree. He's doing his phone
[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:03.180]   They think Ralph is a loser Ralph is pathetic
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:08.380]   2013 they send this kid to jail or there Ralph Ralph has really got problems and then
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:11.580]   Ralph turns on the tv
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:14.700]   And shares the video he's been making on his iphone
[01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:21.580]   This whole time ladies and gentlemen. We give you Ralph's movie a harris family holiday
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:27.340]   See see see what i'm saying that's in that tradition
[01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:32.620]   They do this every year and it's actually the best ads of the year
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:34.940]   Microsoft does the same thing
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:36.940]   Google does the same thing
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:40.860]   And now the family likes Ralph again because it turns out he's not a nerd
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:49.740]   He's gonna make millions. He's the next finalist our privacy and put this on youtube and how dare grandma's crying don't cry grandma
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:51.820]   Oh
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:56.540]   They're all crying old families crying and Ralph. I'm sorry. We thought you were a loser
[01:45:56.540 --> 01:46:01.820]   You're okay, man. You're okay. What you got two million subs on youtube what?
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:07.340]   This is the introverts holiday strategy right here. It is I do it
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:15.260]   Mike l get admitted. He said the reason I have a camera is because I can document the whole thing. Yeah
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:21.340]   So anyway, uh, Adele has a new album
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:24.060]   Wait a minute
[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:28.940]   She has a new album. She has a new single off the album and it's debuted as the commercial on amazon
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:31.020]   It's an amazon holiday ad
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:37.820]   Well, we don't say christmas here. Yes. Yeah, because we killed christmas and zenik laws at big bird too
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:40.060]   Oh, no, that's right big bird's evil. I guess I'm confused
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:43.420]   So here's a young woman walking
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:49.900]   In a city, but she's somehow underground. Is this a dystopian future or oh, she works for amazon
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:54.220]   I'm just got that color right in there dystopian. It does it's got the blue kind of dark
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:59.580]   The children of men coverage children of men coverage exactly exactly but wait
[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:03.260]   You always know when the hopeful music starts
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:07.980]   For all we can oh, she's a college kid. Okay. She's got to do math class
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:12.380]   She's under a lot of fun. She's typing the clock sticking backwards, which was weird
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:14.860]   Um
[01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:16.860]   Maybe that's just I don't know
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:22.220]   Uh, it was wasn't it was cool backwards wasn't it? Yeah, okay. I'm just it's just me. I don't know. I just thought that was on
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:26.380]   Just feels left out. Yeah, all the fun. They're all dancing. This is very similar
[01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:30.620]   To ralph and his uh, iphone experience in 2013. I don't know
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:35.980]   But here we go. Here we go. Here's the payoff down here. Here's the payoff. I mean amazon's gonna make it
[01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:40.780]   Oh, she's tapped. She's the neighbors put in mistletoe up on the door. No, it's a wreath up
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:46.140]   It's a wreath. The neighbor looks at her. They look at each other. The neighbor is her mother. No
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:51.020]   Now i'm depressed. Here's the two and a man's and 13 seconds of young woman
[01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:57.820]   Wednesday amazon delivery guy comes doing one nice neighbor. She's feeding birds the birds
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:01.340]   Toppins a bag the girl smiles
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:03.740]   It happens
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:05.740]   Toppins a bag the girl wait
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:10.140]   Just wait on sana's gonna come into here in a minute. Oh, they did this last year
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:16.220]   Remember the the covid thing they ballerina couldn't do her concert so she had to dance in the roof and then her neighbor
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:21.740]   Made a video out of her just to watch tv anymore. This is grim. This is just all right now
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:27.340]   Now she bought her a bird feeder from the neighbor so she doesn't have to go outside anymore to feed the birds
[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:30.700]   Thanks to the neighbor. It's now the neighbor's stuck in a hunt inside just like she is
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:35.020]   And now we're all in our dystopian boxes
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:42.140]   Is it is it is it really warming up? Oh the little nod
[01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:45.820]   The little that you see the little nod that was the entire acknowledgement
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:51.260]   The little nod that's a terrible ad just like green terrible ad
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:57.660]   Compare that to the apple at heartwarming loving all this was dystopian amazon blue
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:03.900]   Oh, you love dystopia you you spread dystopia all around you. I live in this law spreads presents
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:11.180]   How about meta did you guys have fun talking about meta last week?
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:17.820]   Um, oh, jesus. Bye. We are all sick of talking about them sick of we're confused
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:20.300]   Wait, are we talking about it again? No, no
[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:23.340]   You get to
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:27.980]   This is
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:35.340]   I gotta say though one of the guys on the trip was a facebook engineer. Oh, he said yeah, they're getting me my new cards
[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:41.820]   Um, and this is exactly why I don't want to know people in the business because now I like him and I can't say bad things about facebook
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:43.500]   Yeah, you can
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:45.500]   Yeah, you can
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:47.660]   Um
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:50.940]   There's nothing to say that's the new name. Oh, yeah, love it. Beautiful
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:52.780]   in the feud
[01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:55.980]   And the oh, yeah, I I do have in my hand
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:50:03.980]   What do you have? Well, there's a 26 page trademark applications. Oh, yeah, I'm talking about that
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:06.940]   Facebook file lorius
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:15.660]   Oh my god. They want so when you file a trademark application you say in what area what area like twit has a trademark application and like streaming
[01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:21.740]   Media and technology news that kind of thing you don't say in rubber shoes or slippers or anything like that
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:26.860]   So there could be a twit wicked good slipper. Mm-hmm. That wouldn't infringe right right?
[01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:29.020]   but apparently
[01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:32.060]   Metta wants to own there's 26 pages

[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:09.880]   Okay, so one long sentence. So this is sent for approval. This does this mean that this could be denied? Yes, okay
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:14.040]   So we actually had evan brown on twit. He's a lawyer and an ip lawyer to boot
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:17.320]   And I asked him that's one of the reasons we wanted to have him on and talk about it
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:23.560]   And he said yeah, this is just you know, you ask for the moon. Yeah, but the trademark examiner may say well, okay
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:26.520]   And again, then again, it's meta. They may not I don't know
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:29.960]   Software for file sharing messaging software

[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:56.840]   But wait a minute a lot of this almost sounds like deck you can't even say the word meta if you're just
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:52:02.840]   Speaking is what the way this reads if you're doing critical analysis. God help you. Yeah

[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:23.720]   No, dude. Anyway, I just I don't know if I'm gonna assume there's also lobbying in place when it comes to patent
[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:26.280]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, the examiner is some guy
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:30.520]   Little pin snake glasses. He's got a little sleeve cuffs
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:35.800]   He works in a darkened office on a wooden desk. So he didn't get a thousand nylon handshade. No, okay
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:37.800]   He's got a big rubber stamp and he goes
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:39.800]   So he's bitter he's angry
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:43.800]   Mad might like this he likes to feed the birds. It's that kind of thing
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:47.560]   Let's
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:53.560]   Let's do our tick tock segment of the week forget the google change log. It's time for the tick tock
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:56.200]   change log
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:58.360]   Now we need the 60 minutes clock
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.680]   Actually, I'd like to curious what you think about this stacy
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:07.560]   uh, maybe you've seen on tick tock a lot of uh domestic violence
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:08.440]   uh
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:13.720]   Prevention groups and so forth have promoted this idea that there's a hand gesture if you're feeling unsafe
[01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:18.360]   Maybe you're walking down the street and your boyfriend's got a hold of you and it's going to take you home
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:23.960]   And he's and you're scared to death you could do this hand signal i'm gonna show everybody because this is the new tick tock hand signal
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:26.920]   You bend your thumb and you close your fingers over the thumb
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:32.760]   That's the signal simple, but if you're doing that as you walk down the street your boyfriend may not know what you're doing
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:35.240]   They just look like you're clenching your fist
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:41.400]   I'm okay. That's not I I'm not saying that john slennia has trapped me john john is here
[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:47.800]   And i'm channore the desk nor has aunt prue it taking him hostage. Let's get that clear too. Okay. Let's make that thank you
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:49.320]   so
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:52.760]   A girl who's reported missing in ashfield, north carolina
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:57.000]   In distress in the passenger seat of a car driving through kentucky
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:03.960]   She appeared to be waving through the window to passing cars, but one person in a car nearby recognized
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:11.000]   One tick plus a soul the tick tock signal. That's awesome the girl 16 years old was using a new distress signal
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:16.280]   According to the laurel county sheriff's office the signal created by the canadian women's foundation
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:22.280]   For people to indicate they're at risk of abuse and need help has spread mostly through tick tock in the past year
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:25.800]   The person who saw it apparently a tick tock viewer
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:30.680]   Called 911 said I think this girl's in trouble. She's using the hand gesture
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:34.040]   The dispatcher and officers were unfamiliar with this signal
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:37.640]   But sheriff step eddie's pulled over the car to investigate
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:40.920]   And the person who's so called tracked the car
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:45.880]   Along for some considerable amount of time to an accent and stayed with her
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:48.360]   Which was really a lesson stayed on the phone with the cop
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:53.640]   Same here's where they are mile markers and they found out the girl's parents had reported her missing two days earlier
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:57.800]   They arrested the driver charged with unlawful imprisonment
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:05.880]   Uh, the girl is safe and back home. She'd been she said she'd been trying to get motorist attention as they traveled south from
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:07.720]   Ohio
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:10.200]   The whole time. Hey, so they're just
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:15.240]   Something this is just something it was come up with yeah, just somebody invented it
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:19.240]   Something easy to do that doesn't look like maybe you're doing a signal right?
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:24.200]   It could be a twitch kind of you know, yeah, or you're waving. Yeah, or you're waving. She thought
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:26.680]   I'm the queen. I'm the queen
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:32.600]   Actually, I think I was saying she's trapped in wizard cast. Yes, but that's another matter. Yeah, help me
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:35.400]   Do you know what the what the break in angel? Go ahead
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:41.240]   Sorry, I say so I was gonna say so this is like angel shots, which is exactly
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:43.240]   exactly
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:49.640]   What's what's the name please explain please? So I I wondered if you do so when you order an angel shot at a bar
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:52.600]   You're trying to indicate that the person next to you is
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:58.040]   Upsetting or cause problems for you or whatever. It's like help me. It's it's basically help me
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:55:59.640]   Help me angel shot
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:05.640]   And the idea is that the bartender knows and you don't but the hard thing about all of these is
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:12.920]   When it gets to widespread knowledge, right? Everybody also like the bad guys will also know. Yeah, so there's this weird
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:15.000]   like
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.280]   Not not saying that this is a good and this isn't but
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:21.960]   It's good. Just like a little bit at this time. Yeah
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:24.360]   There's not a kids to this news
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:30.840]   Yeah, more people will know about it to use it and recognize it but also more people who might be kidnapping
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:33.480]   Those people are there
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:41.320]   Anyway, it's a happy story. Yeah, here's an unhappy story the goddamn washington posted not call my son
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:43.800]   I know I was very upset
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:46.600]   This is a uh a trend story apparently
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:48.760]   food on tiktok
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:51.880]   Is just all the rage recipes quick
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:57.880]   Recipes just exactly like my son does salt hank does not do quick recipes
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:02.120]   salt underscore hank they featured uh some people
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:08.520]   But not mr. salt hank who is now at 1.3 million followers now?
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:13.160]   Yeah, his most recent he put it up a few days ago
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:17.560]   Uh, yeah, apparently mexican food is really big
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:22.280]   Uh, let me show you his most recent if it's his burrito. It's not mexican
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:28.280]   No, there's no burritos. Yeah, california. I think that's it. Is that it california burrito?
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:34.600]   Oh, he's at 1.4 million for his burrito. So he put it up four days ago 20 million views
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:40.040]   Um, but no washing the post maybe I should call them on deep background
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:42.840]   I could have said
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:46.920]   I know I know I know I used hank with one of my students this week
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:50.920]   He was talking about a desire to start things and I told and she wanted to do travel
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:54.520]   She wanted to gaster mat she wanted to do travel and and culture and food
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:59.640]   And I told her about salt hank. Yeah, I want to hook him up with uh chef Alex dad and uh
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:00.680]   mexican
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:04.040]   He could do some great tiktok for Alex who wants to get better social
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:07.080]   How does he shoot himself? I've been meaning to ask for that. He's got tripod
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:11.160]   Cannon 5d mark 4. Yeah, gave him that and he's got an iphone
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:12.520]   He's got various
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:18.440]   He's got lots of lights and he's got more clearly tail time. You can tell okay. You can't tell
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:19.880]   Um
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:23.800]   So a couple of success stories. I hope I'm not telling this out of school
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:30.440]   Uh lady gaga's people paid him money to put here her latest single and bond
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:36.520]   One of awesome one of their videos really wow. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think what's interesting
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:41.880]   Yeah, this is the one we can play can we play the music probably they played him a lot of money to do it
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:44.440]   um
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:50.040]   So but it's I think it's interesting that big big performers just like Adele
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:57.320]   Using the amazon ad are going to tiktokkers by the way that few I think that she got a deal 3.3 million on that video
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:04.600]   Nice um so I think lady gaga should give saw thanks more money and tiktok didn't necessarily know that was
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.640]   Ads so they were gonna downgrade it. They didn't
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:12.280]   That's a good point. They don't nobody tell tiktok. Please. Nobody told tiktok
[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:19.400]   Uh, let's see that was his Detroit pizza recipe. Um, he has been approached by cia
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:21.960]   Out of hollywood. Oh, that's the yeah
[01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:26.440]   Big hollywood agency. He's gonna have they're gonna call him. They have a name for it
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:31.960]   Like a shadow client. He doesn't have to sign a deal with them. Mm-hmm, but they've got a relationship
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:37.480]   He's gonna appear on some um syndicated daytime talk show. I can't remember the the host
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:42.920]   He's gonna explain to her today show has been booking the tiktokkers like I know everybody's doing it
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:47.000]   It's good time. You need tiktokker. I was gonna say regis and catholic but um
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:51.560]   Uh the next version you've got contacts. They are still huh? Yeah. Yeah, I should probably call
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:56.840]   They probably would love to do that actually. Yeah, they would. Um, but he's got big agents now
[01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.000]   He's under c a a
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:05.000]   No, I think what would you like to uh on deep background?
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:15.000]   Um what else a lot of success stories. He's he was he uh, he sold three ads for ten thousand dollars to uh, uh,
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:15.960]   Get it
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.000]   a
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:21.560]   Oh, oh the biggest one. I remember to solve the biggest one. He's make he's gonna make a salt
[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:23.800]   He's gonna make a line of salts
[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:29.320]   And the his biggest investor is the founder of f jerry, you know that
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:33.720]   Big big this is back in the day. This was a big social media thing
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:41.000]   Um apparently he made enough money that he's investing but uh, yeah, he's gonna do so stay tuned. I'll be hawking salt from salt
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:48.600]   In the future anyway, so do you know jacks on on tiktok jac dorsey?

[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:29.080]   Hey
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:33.960]   You're probably never gonna forgive me for what happened, but I wanted a chance to explain
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:38.520]   I know it wasn't right that I technically hooked up with your roommate
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:43.240]   But I've been going through a lot and that's not who I am
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:47.160]   I've been failing most of my classes
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:50.280]   You know, I just got fired
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:55.000]   So really appreciate it. It should be some sort of something. What a burn
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000]   Stop making me feel like I'm feeling
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:02.760]   Plus you've been really busy at work. I've been feeling really alone
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:07.080]   I was just really missing you. It was a one-time mistake
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:12.120]   I love you so much more than Emily
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:19.240]   I'm supposed to tell my family. I'm sorry. Okay
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:25.640]   Also, did you change the Netflix password?
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:33.800]   She's great
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:36.760]   Somehow it sounds real though. I don't think we made that one. Yeah
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:41.080]   No, the one with her she has one with her parents about not trying to get a scholarship or something that's hilarious too
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:43.080]   She's all right. I'll play a little bit
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:03:08.600]   Oh my cry
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:13.080]   That's pretty sweet
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:20.920]   Nice isn't that sweet
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:24.040]   See and tiktok is not so bad is it?
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:28.920]   And it's a musical and well, but that's the thing I wish I wish it
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:34.920]   The algorithm would do better for me on tiktok because you keep bringing cool stuff like that
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:38.760]   And I never get to see it but if you follow that and started watching it
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:40.680]   I have to see more of it same time
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:45.720]   I'm starting a lot of these videos. I've actually no not anymore because I've because I watch salt hank stuff
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:49.640]   Unfortunately, it's making me mad because all these people are copying and more
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:53.320]   Maybe they're just doing the same thing and we'll see for me all I see is him
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:57.640]   I don't see as many food things. I keep watching. I keep seeing him a little while
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:03.000]   Yeah, you have to watch things through and it helps if you interact with the type of content. Yes
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:08.840]   Yeah, at least like it. Yeah, that makes sense. I do hit like on it and come because I find
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:12.760]   And the weirdest thing is they're good tiktok days and bad tiktok days
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:19.800]   I'll go in one day and oh wow look at all this and the music that I like all this constant the next day every single thing is stupid and boring
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:25.640]   Maybe it's my mood. I don't know but I think it it I just try to test be or something. It's it does change
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:28.040]   Yeah, I get a lot of this stupid
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:34.520]   Mindless stuff that everybody thinks is funny. Did I never find funny and I'm constantly scrolling through that stuff
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:41.080]   You're a tough critic even within two seconds. I don't I don't care to see some of the two seconds good go
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:42.840]   I try
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:45.400]   I try because I don't want it to keep feeding it to me

[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:32.280]   Because I have a astute who's his name sex or his location
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:34.680]   Oh, that's neat
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:37.960]   Actually, that's a big thing right now and rene richy was talking about that on tuesday
[02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:40.680]   uh particularly on twitch
[02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:43.400]   But uh and youtube
[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:45.400]   Uh, but they're raising money to clean
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:48.120]   Sea garbage. Have you seen that?
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:51.880]   Yeah, I always wonder how real some of these are the garbage patch
[02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:56.200]   Well, no because well, yes, the garbage patch is one problem
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:08:01.560]   But let me show you that it's the hashtag. I'm trying to remember but I have it here in the rundown from
[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:03.400]   from uh
[02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:06.280]   It's sla hashtag team sees if you go to team
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:14.600]   seas they have raised 14.3 million dollars and removed 14.3 million pounds
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:19.160]   From out of how much I want the denominator. Well, that's a good question
[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:23.000]   But look even uh even susan wojiskey
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.960]   The ceo of youtube because it is a youtube kind of youtubers doing it
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:30.840]   Uh, she she gave 350 thousand dollars
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:35.080]   Uh, what do you do with this plastic? I mean, it's not like you put it in the
[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:37.960]   The dump land fell
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:45.080]   Well, they also make it. I'm not against the bracelet and it's yeah, you guys throw those away
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:47.880]   I'm just saying I know
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:52.520]   Yeah, the great mandala you can turn it into a mice for microsoft
[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:58.120]   Anyway, I think actually this is quite legitimate and uh and it's been doing very well
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:02.360]   Both through youtube and I think for three. That's awesome. Yep. They've started in uh
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:08.040]   They started not so long ago. They're already up to the 14.3 million, which is pretty good
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:11.080]   All right, let's do our google
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:17.080]   You know what play the drum you forgot only two weeks gone and you forgot already what they're calling
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:20.280]   Change log. I'm just waiting for him to press the button
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:25.320]   The google change log
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:35.800]   I think it wasn't I who forgot i'm just saying there were others involved in the change log
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:37.960]   Oh past the box
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:44.040]   Google is taking signups or something new a speech assistant that recognizes impaired speech
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:46.600]   They call it relate
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:53.160]   Uh, we saw this at google. I oh, I don't think it was last year. Was it maybe it was your before last? Yeah, it was a year before last
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:58.520]   Uh g dot c o slash project relate you can you can sign up
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000]   be included in beta
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:09.000]   You actually have to uh if you provide it with us examples of you talking they need at least 500 phrases to be trained
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.080]   So that's going to take you a while half an hour to an hour and a half to record
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:16.280]   You could do it at your own pace and need an android phone
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:19.320]   running android uh
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:21.320]   eight or later
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:26.120]   And uh you even can explain what it is. Is it your accent or there are other issues
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:31.880]   Uh making speech difficult what country do you live in? I think that's kind of going to be kind of interesting
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:36.680]   Yeah, google uh, yeah, they've been talking for a long time about this
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:39.560]   Uh because of course if you're scottish
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:42.840]   Uh, the google assistant has no idea what you're saying
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:45.800]   No, I don't do other people
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:53.400]   Let's be real. I'm joking google assistant no longer offers your news update audio digests
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:56.920]   No
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:02.520]   Uh as of uh, let's see they they started you could say hey, you know who play me the news
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:05.240]   They started this two years ago
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:11.960]   But as for always with google they got tired of it two years later shocking it's gone
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:14.920]   It's gone
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:22.440]   Uh, although I do I do want to mention they're showing in this uh a picture of the google home assistant
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:24.600]   speaker
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:30.120]   And paul tharratt reminded me that google's got some pretty good black friday deals coming up
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:33.320]   Including 50 bucks off or 40 bucks off
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:36.360]   Uh the google assistant the nice speaker
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:42.200]   So it'll be 59.99. Mm-hmm. So you might want to know those those yes
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:48.440]   That might be nice. Hey, that's a nice guy. They sound really good. They're my favorite of all the new generation
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:52.840]   $9 smart speakers that was my favorite because it wasn't super bassy
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:57.080]   And it paid attention to the mid range because that's why I was um
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:04.120]   Uh, that's why I was very uh sad about the google home max because which I love and I listen to every morning
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:10.520]   Um, they discontinued that but it sounds like it was pretty big. It sounds like these sound almost good. Right
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:15.560]   So I never had the max so I can't compare it. I just compared apples to apples
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:20.440]   50 dollars on a pixel 5a that'll be down to 399
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:24.920]   $10 in a chrome cast with google tv down to 40 dollars in nest cam
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:31.080]   30 off 150 150 instead of 180 dollars the nest doorbell the nest hub
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:35.800]   Which I really like by the way a big fan of the nest hub although I prefer the max
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:41.720]   Uh the nest cam with floodlight and then the nest audio is what they call that 40 dollars off
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:44.200]   That's 59. Uh, I'm thinking of buying a few of them
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:47.800]   I really think that's great the nest wifi router not a fan
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:52.120]   Those are on sale as is the nest thermostat down to a hundred dollars. So
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:58.520]   Uh those are those are the black friday deals. So I think it's the 18th
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:03.320]   Reverb might in the chat 50 dollars off didn't know discontinued them
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:09.080]   Yeah, it could be sounds about right. But you know what the google home max is discontinued still works
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:11.240]   I still love it. Yeah, still a great thing
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:18.120]   I still have my Lenovo google display running around after oh, that's great. Yeah, I think they're great there
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:25.160]   You know, I put all of the pictures we took in mexico plus all the pictures Mike took he created a google photos
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:32.520]   Uh, no album notebook album. Yes shared album and those are all going into my uh nest hub max
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:38.520]   So i've got a slideshow and it's like already in there. Nice. I love that. I think that's just a nice thing. I really like that
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:40.520]   So stacy
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:44.200]   Uh, I think i'm going through the same thing you went through on the phone. It was supposed to be delivered today

[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:37.720]   I mean, I don't actually know if that's what they are, but yeah, I've worn this before and y'all
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:41.560]   Yeah, I always like it. Yeah. Yeah. I remember it now google home
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:44.520]   2.46 for android
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:49.880]   finally the android google tv remote on the phone
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:57.640]   They actually have a very good remote for the google tv. I like it a lot, but it's nice because it's small easy to misplace
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:05.640]   Now they will be the google home app will have a built-in remote control for your android and google tv
[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:08.360]   Yay, that's good news
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:11.400]   Um, if you do get the nest hub
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:18.040]   The second generation there's going to be an update you said you were using it for sleep tracking right stacy
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:22.360]   Actually now it's on my desk, but I have used it on for sleep tracking
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:23.960]   What am I gonna get?
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:30.200]   Updates will add sleep stages and localize snore detection. I thought you already had that
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:37.000]   I have this localized protection and I oh now free until 2023. Maybe that's the new thing
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:43.640]   No longer well, they they know they said that they were gonna char they said when they launched it they said
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:46.520]   We don't know how
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:49.000]   Like it's free for now is what they said
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:54.120]   Well, and then when you've pushed them on that they said well, we don't know what's gonna happen, you know in the future
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:16:00.920]   And maybe they're basically saying they've improved it too because any coughing and snoring that happens outside your area
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:06.040]   Will not appear in your snoring timeline, but in the other sounds timeline
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:13.960]   So that's good like I mean if you're my husband like yeah doesn't well sometimes he snores he doesn't admit it
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:17.480]   But he's a nurse. Yeah, you'll be in the other section
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:20.840]   um
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:25.240]   Calm medication from calm calm a sponsor of our shows
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:32.200]   Sleep sensing free through 2022, but that it will become part of fit bit premium in 2023
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:37.320]   That's 10 bucks a month or $80 annually, but you like that sleep feature
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:41.240]   Stacy I have I have used it and I do like it. Yeah
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:44.360]   finally
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:51.480]   If you've got a pixel six, I don't know what to think about this stay tuned adaptive sound appears to be rolling out now
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:57.160]   Now i've had adaptive sound in my Samsung devices for a long time and actually it's a feature. I love
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:03.400]   What do you love about it? I I I have an experience that before all I know is these little speakers are
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:10.840]   Super duper tiny. They're good. I don't know what to expect, you know from a tiny tiny speaker from a
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:14.600]   But also will work. I think it'll work with headphones too. So I don't know
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:21.480]   Uh, bond maybe not to help combat adaptive sound feature uses your on device microphone assess surrounding
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:26.440]   You're right audio levels and acoustics and adjust the equalizer to produce better sounds
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:29.000]   But I mean it's tiny speakers
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.760]   I you know, let me play let me play some music
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:35.720]   Sound let me play some music because I I have to say
[02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:40.360]   These speakers on this phone are the best I've seen they are loud. I know that much. Yeah
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000]   What can I play that I won't get in trouble?
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:47.400]   Uh, nothing. Oh play the renaissance fair. Ren fair
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:50.520]   Yeah
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:57.480]   I love that song by the way mysterious moods
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:02.440]   Dinner music playlists. Yeah. No, I've tried that before. That's not my dinner party
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:08.040]   Uh, oh, I know a podcast would probably work wouldn't it? Iot podcast there we go
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:15.640]   You will you won't sue me if I play that, right? I promise I will not actually I think I'll just play uh this
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:21.080]   Show, let me see. How do I get it to play? Okay? I think this I don't know if this is going to communicate
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:28.280]   But I think the speakers are quite good on this there. I know they're loud and so loud they vibrate this the skin on my hand
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:34.680]   Also joining me stacey higgin boughton jeff jarvis and and prue it we talk about how I think it sounds pretty good
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:37.320]   Probably can't really tell
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:41.560]   Specifically about the photo cap clear
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:46.360]   It's better if I play some music, but I actually how do I stop it?
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:49.320]   Yeah, and 12
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:52.360]   Can't try 12. It's a learning curve
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:54.120]   12
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:58.440]   Adaptive sound I thought this was going to be the adaptive sound that it has I have on the Samsung which I love
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:03.560]   You put in headphones and it plays like an audiologist with tones left ear right ear
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:09.480]   You say I can hear that I don't hear that I hear that I hear that and then it adapts a curve for your particular hearing abilities
[02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:14.680]   And that would be awesome fantastic. This is not that now what the awesome. So I apologize. I thought my job is have that
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:18.440]   Your john john per job, bro. You wear john perse
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:22.200]   Job brass 19. I wear john perse
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:25.000]   Only when i'm writing which is never
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:29.400]   And that's the google change log
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:31.400]   Okay
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:36.840]   John's a little slow on the uptake today
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:41.560]   It's not
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:52.920]   Did you see the this is completely not germane to anything the grafting axios about the average wholesale
[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:56.520]   Used vehicle value look at that spike
[02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:03.400]   And this is that this is the same reason that pixel six is delayed. This is that supply chain thing
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:06.760]   and new cars are basically unattainable so
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:10.520]   Used vehicles have jumped 9.2
[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:15.800]   Over the last month man that means that the value of a used vehicle is 38
[02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:18.200]   Higher than the same car a year ago
[02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:23.400]   So wow, I should sell my car now. Yeah
[02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:25.640]   Yeah
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:29.720]   This is actually not a good time normally for used cars because this is when the new cars
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:34.840]   The new model year comes out and and use car sales plummet, but not so because you can't get anything
[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:37.640]   You can't get any super round out of my little scooter
[02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:42.520]   I got did you see uh, I haven't posted I should post it. I have a new tricycle
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:47.800]   Really you got a trike. I look like a dork. I had a uh recumbent trike that
[02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:52.520]   But the problem with that is you're really low to the ground and people would throw bottles of beer at me
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:54.760]   so
[02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:56.760]   And other things yeah
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:20:58.760]   So I bought a high up in the air
[02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:04.760]   Tricycle and now I just look like an old guy. What is that? Yeah, show you have a picture of that
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:08.920]   Um, well, I could show it on the website. I have not yet. That's what it means. I have not yet
[02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:12.280]   We want to see pictures of you. Yeah, I've not yet posted pictures. The discord is
[02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:16.680]   Delivering. I just want you to know that they have pictures of me running my drink
[02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:19.320]   nice for no
[02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:21.320]   No, they're just delivering some
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:26.840]   A little bit like that. I look a little bit like that. Yeah, uh, no, it's bigger
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:36.360]   It's bigger than that. This is it's pretty silly. There it is. This is this is what I guess. No, you got you got a roll
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:41.960]   But it's in look it's got to be basket. I can take both three ladies are
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:49.480]   Awesome. Well, I honestly thought that I'd be much less likely to beer bottles thrown at me because they'd be feel sorry for me
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:51.480]   No, now you're so sorry
[02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:54.040]   Sorry for you
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:57.400]   Because when you recumbent you look like there's like a toad going
[02:21:57.400 --> 02:22:02.760]   It's better than you because I pedaled forward instead of down. There's more
[02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:07.160]   I'm more more power plus you got flags and stuff and they throw butte bottles
[02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:11.000]   I know it's not all the people that pick up trucks instead of rolling cold. They just throw
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:16.920]   Bottles out the window. I this is like here the wicked mitts in the west and try to take total in the back of the bike
[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:19.480]   To the
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:21.960]   Yeah, I'm really literally like a fire
[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:23.880]   G bikes
[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:29.640]   They have the the big basket so you can actually carry so the bike becomes more you totally do that
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:30.840]   Yes
[02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:35.720]   Well, the reason I got it is because of the supply chain shortage because lisa's car has been delayed
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:39.560]   We've been in one car family. I thought well lisa don't worry. I'll ride my trike to work
[02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:44.520]   No, you don't want to yet not yet
[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:47.960]   Too soon. Did you see this? This will be my pick of the week
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:55.240]   Uh, I guess you put this in jeff. I don't know twitter tv. Yes, I did any twitter account into a screensaver
[02:22:55.240 --> 02:22:58.200]   So let's just do jeff javis
[02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:04.840]   Uh-oh. Yeah, we were finding how much you've been tweeting but hey, we're loading jeff javis just a second
[02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:12.840]   This is my new scowl my new screensaver. Yeah, what it does is a screensaver. It never static never sits still
[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:17.880]   You're gonna get an error for him. I'm pretty sure really really because you don't post enough photos
[02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:19.400]   Oh
[02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:21.400]   It's once photos. You want to photos
[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:27.320]   I said just I tried it santee photo or rick salmon rick salmon. I love it ricke
[02:23:27.320 --> 02:23:32.440]   S-a-l-m-o-n s-a-m-o-n. Oh, that's right salmon
[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:39.560]   Yeah, yeah, okay. This will be better because he's if one of my favorite stock. He does some great stuff still broken
[02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:42.680]   Oh, you broke it. We broke it
[02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:44.440]   You broke it
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:47.720]   So what it does is it takes photos out of your twitter feed makes it a screensaver
[02:23:47.720 --> 02:23:50.200]   I'm old enough to remember when we hear about screensavers
[02:23:50.200 --> 02:23:57.640]   I remember uber burdock tried to buy or by think he bought the company that the whole idea was we own the screensaver
[02:23:57.640 --> 02:24:01.640]   And I thought that's when you go to the bathroom
[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:05.320]   Who has no no no we're gonna put news on the screens. Oh
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:07.720]   Yeah
[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:14.680]   What was the name point cast remember that yeah, there was the idea was uh that point cast and this is
[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:17.220]   2004
[02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:20.520]   The point cast would download all your news
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:25.560]   And then put it up in a screensaver or some sort of former fashion season. Yeah, I think that was up
[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:27.400]   Yeah, it was and uh
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:31.160]   And uh, I remember we all had it at the site on msnbc
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:35.880]   And so when you first came in and turn on your computer everybody turn on the computer at the same time in the morning
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:38.440]   The unit just just was to a crawl
[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:44.360]   Was everybody's point cast is downloading the latest news. They would see st operations in 2000
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:48.360]   Swearcon found in 1982. Oh, you know what? I'm on the Linux. Oh
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:51.000]   Imagine that
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.160]   It's where let me just open the terminal here
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:25:01.160]   Yeah, news corp did buy point cast. Oh, there you go. So that was
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:05.080]   Many many internet failures. He's just never ever
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:08.040]   So I've got a chip question
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:11.560]   Can I go ahead and do that? Yeah, you can talk about far-hod. Yeah
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:18.040]   So he fails over apples chip and how important it is because how fast it is
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:18.920]   Yeah
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:24.280]   And I was just wondering whether whether speed and power is what matters or what whether i'm interested in the tensor
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:25.880]   for what
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:30.920]   specific functionality of ai and such that brings down to the device level
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:37.880]   What's the more important thing going for well actually apples doing exactly the same thing with their chips that that google's doing with theirs
[02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:43.160]   Both companies are designing chips specifically for the hardware and software platform
[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:45.800]   So in fact
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:50.760]   There is the same kind of ai in apples chips. They have a whole module devoted to it
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:54.920]   What's happening? It's it that is in dry. I don't try to agree with with far-hod
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:56.920]   Who's really going crazy?
[02:25:56.920 --> 02:25:58.920]   But what's interesting is because we're down to
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:01.720]   Such chip densities now
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:04.920]   Literally billions of transistors on a chip in these new apple chips
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:11.320]   I think it was 57 billion on top of the line chip because they're five nanometer the next generation will be three nanometer
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:15.000]   So such density there's there's a lot of room
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.440]   So what they're doing on these on these big
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:21.560]   Systems on a chip is they're putting the ram in there
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:27.160]   Which means the ram's available to both the graphics processor and the cpu and at high speed
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:31.000]   So instead of being a limp kind of a graphics card that maybe has
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.400]   25 or 64
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:37.880]   You know as a limited amount of room on it now it's a all the memory is available to it
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:44.440]   It's not being used by the operating system or your apps and it's operating at a much higher speed because it's on the chips itself
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:50.120]   There's all these units that apples putting in high performance and high efficiency cores
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:55.400]   It is I think it's a big breakthrough compared with what until an AMD you're doing but more importantly
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:26:59.560]   It's doing it a very much lower power now. We've only seen the laptop chips
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:03.560]   I think apple's gonna do desktop chips that are just gonna blow these away. There'll be a three nanometers
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:07.320]   They'll have 40 cores. They'll be very very powerful chips
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:11.800]   It's gonna be very hard for anybody else to come close cools tensor is similar
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:13.480]   but uh
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:17.880]   Apple's been doing you know apple's been creating these chips for more than 10 years when the iPhone came out
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:21.560]   I'm starting making their own chips. So apple has a little bit of a head start in this
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:23.960]   So i'm not i don't know. I haven't read this article
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:25.960]   Been making their own networking
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:27.400]   Sure these tpus
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:31.880]   Tensor is based on the cpus. Yeah tpus. Yeah, never mind. I would
[02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:34.760]   Go all I know is this pixel six pro is
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:41.800]   Way faster than the fus it knows partly that's the 120 Hertz too though, right? It's so much more responsive. Yeah
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:44.840]   Way better. I like it
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:47.880]   It's interesting that far had wrote this opinion piece in the New York times
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:53.240]   Of what's you know chip nerds like stacy geek out over this stuff
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:56.680]   That's why I was asking and i'm surprised that he thinks that anybody cares
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:02.760]   Then read the op-ed gauge so no people people some of my biggest chip stories have been
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:07.160]   When you explain what it means? I don't think he actually did the best job explaining it
[02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:11.080]   I think if you look at the architecture shift here
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:16.120]   The biggest thing and I said this when when a couple shows ago when we talked about this
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:20.600]   This is a chip designed for graphical workloads
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:29.000]   And it's a chip designed to process in parallel and that's a big shift from how chips were made in the past unless you were doing a graphics chip
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:33.000]   But AI requires parallelization as to graphics
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:38.280]   Message here is if you look at chips as tea leaves to see what's happening
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:41.080]   Is that everything we're going to put computing in?
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:48.120]   Needs to be able to do and perform robust graphics and make its own like run neural networks
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:51.320]   That's that's it. So where we're going is
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:56.680]   Every computer become I mean if you're doing the metaverse, it's going to be part of computing
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:00.840]   That sort of thing if you're thinking simple just ar or vr
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:09.720]   Simple ar it's for that. I mean, that's the big c change that's happened here. I don't think he does a good job articulating it
[02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:15.720]   I think he's he's right in one regard, which is there there is something happening
[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:18.200]   You know
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:21.640]   There's there's definitely something happening and you make a really good point
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:26.760]   And I think this is we talk about this a lot of Mac break weekly, but I think what you're really seeing is apple
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:29.160]   moving along
[02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:35.320]   With chips that are very specific to the hardware and software they have the advantage of making the whole stack
[02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:37.960]   And that's gonna give them for years
[02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:43.320]   Here the real advantage here is they have a buy off the shelf parts from intel though
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:46.040]   Which we're not as tuned to what they wanted to do
[02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:51.640]   What they did here the significant thing that they did though is they built a
[02:29:51.640 --> 02:29:58.760]   A network fabric for the system on a chip that handles the data in parallel and pulls for that code
[02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:00.760]   Absolutely the co-operating
[02:30:00.760 --> 02:30:06.280]   Co-located ram. Yeah, so that's that's what's exciting here and it's not that
[02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:11.240]   It's designed for the hardware because we've actually been designing chips
[02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:13.320]   for
[02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:16.200]   Specific apps and for hardware for quite some time
[02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:21.320]   What's cool here is the memory bandwidth constraint like we've been fighting
[02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:28.920]   When I started covering supercomputers two decades ago, that was our big issue right that they were trying to solve the memory bandwidth problem
[02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:34.680]   But now every computer that we have is computing like a freaking supercomputer because we've got
[02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:39.000]   AI that's ubiquitous and because we need it for the graphics profiles
[02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:45.800]   And it's awesome and that's the cool thing that they did. I'm so sorry, but this is like stacy's favorite thing
[02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:47.800]   This is why I put it in there. I want to hear you said
[02:30:47.800 --> 02:30:49.960]   Thank you
[02:30:49.960 --> 02:30:51.400]   memory bandwidth
[02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:54.840]   Solving a huge problem with building his network fabric
[02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:58.200]   Okay, no one would ever read my column in the new york times
[02:30:58.200 --> 02:31:03.400]   But yeah, it's actually I think it's even more than that it's low power
[02:31:04.280 --> 02:31:11.320]   That's massively parallel. You're right. The low the incredible bandwidth is just out of out of the out of the park
[02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:16.280]   But I also I don't think you can uh disregard the fact that apples in owns the whole stack
[02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:23.720]   And a company that can make everything instead of buying off the shelf parts, which is unfortunately what google still does
[02:31:23.720 --> 02:31:28.680]   Um for I mean who knew who made this tensor chip. We're not sure, but it's probably samson
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:31.720]   Um, it's a different it's a different
[02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:36.520]   Uh, deal. I mean, I'm sure google designed the tensor chip, but they still had to use
[02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:40.200]   I don't know what probably an exenos is the cpu
[02:31:40.200 --> 02:31:46.680]   It's not it's not yet to that level of integration that apple is I think completely owns at this point at this point
[02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:48.680]   There's no one else who's doing it all
[02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:51.240]   In fact, some have said this chip is essentially a swift machine
[02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:54.120]   And it's it's designed to run swift
[02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:58.520]   Which is what they want
[02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:03.640]   Server companies have been building chips for their workloads
[02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:09.560]   And if you think of the way the servers with the opc the open compute foundation or opf
[02:32:09.560 --> 02:32:15.160]   Open compute foundation. Yeah, so all that's basically commodity
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:23.400]   Um hardware, but they've designed the chips specific to the workload not the hardware and that's been happening for a decade
[02:32:23.800 --> 02:32:29.720]   So I yes, I get what you're saying here, but we don't have commodity hardware and phones really yet
[02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:31.880]   Um
[02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:33.640]   I don't know
[02:32:33.640 --> 02:32:39.880]   I I basically i'm politely saying I disagree with your assessment that the big thing is apples building their chips for the hardware
[02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:43.320]   I think it's well, I agree. I completely agree with you as memory bandwidth, but it's not just memory
[02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:45.320]   But there's a whole lot of other things
[02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:52.520]   Uh going on here for instance when you're writing and swift there's certain instructions that you use a lot and apple literally made this chip
[02:32:52.600 --> 02:32:57.480]   Optimized for those particular instructions that means performance through the roof
[02:32:57.480 --> 02:33:01.720]   And that's something that somebody doesn't make the chips open computes fine. I mean, that's a server platform
[02:33:01.720 --> 02:33:06.200]   That's a very narrow slice of I mean we're talking about general purpose computing too
[02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:09.640]   So but I know but on the on the server side
[02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:13.720]   They've been designing the chips for the application because they don't have to care about the hardware
[02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:18.920]   So and you could argue that you know apples designing for the hardware
[02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:28.840]   And the applications they're dividing for the whole stack the hardware the software the programming language the uses and furthermore they're planning for things like AI
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:35.160]   Uh ar they're planning for advanced uses and because they are designing the whole thing
[02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:41.240]   They have a huge advantage that no one who's buying off the shelf parts can can meet and that's why amdian intel
[02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:45.560]   Just can't compete they have to design a general purpose chip. They're not building open compute chips
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:48.120]   Specifically they're building general purpose chips
[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:55.320]   Uh, in fact alder lake which competes I guess to some degree in in terms of pure clock speed
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:34:05.240]   And and performance does it at 250 watts. So yeah, it's not a but intel has been sucking at price performance per watt since like
[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:10.040]   Oh, but that's like the number one guy right that oh I know they just but they've
[02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:13.880]   They optimized for the wrong things as we moved into
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:19.800]   Server computing with monolithic apps right and that was a big problem for them then they tried to course correct
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:40.320]   But then they had brian crescresc
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:45.640]   All right, let's uh take a break when we come back. We are going to get your picks of the week because it is late
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:51.000]   It is time to wrap this up. Wow puppy up. I hate to stop. I love the conversation
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:55.160]   Uh, if you follow our conversations and you're interested in this kind of stuff
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:35:00.520]   Perhaps you've been thinking if there were only some way I could capitalize on my knowledge of the tech industry
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:07.320]   If I only had the access to the deal flow that that these top investors have I would probably
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:09.320]   be
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:11.960]   Buying an island in hawaii right about now
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:18.280]   Well, I want to tell you about our crowd because this is exactly what our crowd is all about our crowd is
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:24.520]   A an investment company vc's they have their own portfolio. They have their own investments
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:26.600]   But they also have deal flow
[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:33.480]   And they're willing to let you in on it. Go ahead. You just go down the go down and ask uh john dor if he'll let you in on his next big
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:35.480]   Deal. No, he won't but our crowd will
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:40.680]   All around the world there are amazing startups amazing technet companies that are
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:46.440]   Innovating driving returns for investors the problem is we only learn about them when they go public when they make an exit
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:52.360]   Our crowd is analyzing companies across the global private market
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:59.720]   Looking at companies with the greatest growth potential early stage companies then brings them to you from personalized medicine
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:02.120]   That's going to be very hot in the next few years
[02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:07.800]   Cyber security that's hot today robotics even things like quantum computing and more
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:13.560]   In state of the art labs and startup garages anywhere in between our crowd is identifying innovators
[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:17.560]   So you can invest when the growth potential is the greatest early
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:22.200]   Our crowd is the fastest growing venture capital investment community in the world
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:27.240]   There are accredited investors have already invested over a billion dollars in growing tech companies
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:31.000]   29 of their portfolio companies are unicorns
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:33.640]   Worth a billion or more
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:37.960]   Many of our crowd members have benefited from over 40 ipos or sale exits
[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:44.440]   Of portfolio companies if you go to the website you can see the companies and the exits and you'll see some big big name
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:47.240]   Exis now it's too late to get in on those but now
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:52.840]   Is time to get in on some new deals now? I have to say there's some limitations. So I really
[02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:58.200]   Uh, you need to be an accredited investor. You need to know what you're doing in every country has different rules
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:02.920]   For accredited investors. So I want you to go to our crowd.com/twig
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:07.640]   And you can say what country you're in and you can say and you'll see what the rules are
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:10.600]   But once you're in a once you're an accredited investor
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:15.240]   You can participate in single company deals for as little as $10,000
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:18.440]   They have funds you can buy in for as little as $50,000
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:23.800]   But a minimum of 10 I just want to be upfront with you a minute of 10 10,000 is required to invest
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:28.840]   And again, you have to qualify you have to have a certain net worth and so forth
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:30.280]   because
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:32.920]   People they don't want you spending the rent money on this
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:37.960]   Uh, go to the site and in the country you're visiting from you can see what the requirements are
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:42.600]   I'll give you an example though of some of the investments. This one is is available right now
[02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:46.280]   You can invest right now an intel act i n t e l l a c t
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:51.720]   Their transportation innovation could save the airline industry $3 billion a year
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:58.440]   What are they doing? They're using machine learning to improve safety to recognize hazards and reduce delays
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:01.080]   Already in use at major international airports
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:04.600]   Serving over 100 million passengers annually
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:12.120]   But they're still very early stage now is the time to get in and you can at our crowd. Oh, you are
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:19.640]   CR o wd. This is just one of a number of investments again. This is intended for savvy
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:25.960]   Investors, uh, but if you're looking for a little something extra to do beyond, you know buying stocks
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:31.800]   You have diamond hands with your amc stock. This is a this is something I always wanted to do
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:35.160]   I can't because I can't invest in anything that we might cover
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:41.560]   But I always felt like gosh i'm watching all these companies and all my friends investing these companies and they're all
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:47.800]   Making lots of money. How do you get in? How do you get this deal flow? This is a way to do it our crowd.com
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:50.600]   Slash to a gig by the way, it's free to join
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:55.400]   Find out if you're uh, you know, you reach the threshold for accredited investor
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:39:00.440]   And then read up on all this stuff you can completely do it as a tourist and just enjoy it
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:04.200]   But you might find something that you go, you know, I really want to get in on that one
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:08.840]   Our crowd. Oh, you are cr o wd.com slash
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:14.760]   Twig. It's the fastest growing venture capital investment community out there. Our crowd.com slash
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:16.840]   Twig
[02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:22.280]   And uh, you know, I thought this is something I think I should tell people about I think it's pretty cool our crowd
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:25.240]   now it's time
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:28.280]   For stasis thing of the week
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:34.840]   Or jeff just jeff you should hear vertko
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:42.760]   I'm sorry. No, that's not it press that other button birth. What do you got there press a button come on any button
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:45.800]   There it is stacy
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:51.800]   Stacy and iot.com at gigastacy this iot podcast chip guru
[02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:54.840]   and robot lover
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:59.720]   Oh, okay. Yes, this week my pick is I'm just going to tell you something
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:04.360]   This is your last minute christmas gift for me to you info so we
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:11.640]   We did our gift guide and one of the things given the supply chain issues that we're having if you've need a last minute gift
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:14.120]   might I suggest
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:15.960]   subscriptions
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:17.960]   and unfortunately
[02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:21.960]   I was thinking about like all the smart home things or a peloton subscription
[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:25.160]   None of these people make it easy because it's all tied to your account
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:33.960]   So the best way to do this and to make a cute gift is to buy a v-scard or master card gift card in a prepaid amount
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:37.880]   Set that up for and tell them what it's for
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:43.960]   Um for the amount of the subscription so they will enter that in as they're basically their credit card for that
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:45.640]   um and then
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:51.480]   I would wrap it with like a water bottle if you're gonna give someone is like a sporting app or a thing of popcorn
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:56.040]   If you're gonna do a streaming subscription those do have gift cards available by the way
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:40:57.640]   um
[02:40:57.640 --> 02:41:02.920]   And yeah, so I just wanted to like throw that out there because these are dead easy to find
[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:07.320]   It's a little bit less, you know, you're not buying someone cash you're recognizing that hey
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:11.800]   I know you have this nest cam and maybe you don't want to buy the nest for a subscription
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:18.040]   So that was my it was one of our gift tips, but I do think it's actually a really useful one
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:20.200]   I like this one. It smells like vanilla
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:22.920]   Oh
[02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:28.120]   It's a vanilla flavored prepaid card. I like it. You could find a lot of crazy ones
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:36.040]   So and you do have other suggestions, which is great books thermometers also. Yeah, this was the dystopian
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:42.760]   Uh gift guide. I was not feeling I didn't want to tell people to go but oh actually y'all would love this on this show
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:49.320]   This is the uh, it's a book how they built the android operating system. I've read an excerpt from it
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:54.600]   It's really good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so yeah go out and get that for any android lovers out there
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:42:00.200]   Um, we threw it on there because half the internet of things runs on android. Right. Um, it's a great book
[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:03.560]   There's your apple layer tags if you can this is a problem though
[02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:07.240]   I mean it's probably already too late to get a lot of things you might want to get because of the
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:12.920]   Chip shortage and so forth. Well, that's that's why I was like, oh, let's come up with some things plus
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:17.720]   I just don't feel like given the privacy concerns. We have climate change
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:22.200]   I'm like, god, do we really want to buy another gadget that's going to spy on you and contribute to like
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:28.280]   Plastic waste in the ocean. That's true. And if you give somebody socks, you can say I'm giving you the gift of privacy
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:34.360]   These are private socks and then you may you wear them only you're ever no one will ever know
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:39.080]   You're wearing these and it was it's good everybody. I bought them with bighoints. So no one knows
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:41.640]   That's good. I like it
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:44.440]   What's a big one? Stacy holding up her new phone that just arrived

[02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:07.640]   And now mr. And prill it's pick all right. I forgot what my picks were had to look down at sheet first one
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:11.080]   That happens to me all the time. That's what we put all the other ones
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:13.720]   I'm looking at it. Did I put that in there? Oh
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:17.320]   I'm I'm sitting here looking at this and thinking you know
[02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:24.200]   This is my pick but I'm sure I'm behind the times when it comes to the popular tv shows and popular movies and all of that
[02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:28.840]   Well, I recently watched the harder they fall starring edris elba
[02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:34.600]   And regina king and several other notable actors, but you had me at regina king
[02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:41.240]   And it's a um a western. I never watched westerns my dad did he used to watch the rifleman and all of that
[02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:46.040]   Oh, yeah back in days. I've never had an interest in that. What do you do when you're bonded and you know you're a man
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:48.760]   What is that?

[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:02.680]   Great ending great color grading
[02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:06.840]   Um, and it looks like there's probably going to be a second second one
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:11.480]   For this movie the harder they fall in its the netflix production
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:13.560]   Um
