[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.360]   We got the old gang back together. I'm so happy to see Gina Tarpani in her offices. Hi, Gina.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.280]   Hi. It's great to be here. I saw you yesterday in all about Android looking at that one plus one
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.840]   phone that Jason had. Dang, that is a nice-looking phone. I don't know. I really was like, I like
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.560]   seeing CyanogenMod on the back of a phone. Is that kind of cool? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I made me really
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.960]   happy. I was like, "Oh, hackers legitimize that I want that phone. I think that's one of the few
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.000]   non-pure Google phones. Technically non-pure Google phone that I really want." It's a great slice.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It's a nice, unbelievable. Yeah. Also here, Jeff Jarvis, that's him. You hear that baritone.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.440]   That's JJ. He's a professor. I'm so profundo. Boss, I'm sorry, the boss so profundo of Jeff
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.640]   Ridge Arvis. He is, he's, he's, well, look at him. He's a professor of journalism at a university,
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.360]   City University of New York, the author. He's a published author of public parts and what would
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.520]   Google do and Gutenberg the geek. Blogs at Buzz Machine. Actually, your latest post will be
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.760]   fodder for today's conversation. Also with us, good to have him, Mr. Kevin Marks in his garden.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.800]   Hi, Kevin. Nice to see you. I actually even have honest use of my tree to drink today.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.920]   Oh, that looks delicious. Oh, you are so obnoxious, Marks. You're outside. You have the breeze,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.520]   the good weather. It is me. You have your smoke. This is how my mom got us to move to California
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.280]   from Rhode Island. She said you can go out on the porch and pick an orange from the tree.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.360]   You can go out for it, yeah. Little did I know that's how they got the jodes to move from Oklahoma
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:30.880]   and grapes of rats. Didn't work out so well. I miss it. I miss the weather and picking oranges
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.640]   off the trees. I have to admit, I really do. What's the weather in Brooklyn?
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.880]   What's the weather in Brooklyn? Well, you know, the temperature, it's fine. It's just if you
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.360]   walk two blocks and you're like instantly soaked and then you're getting on the subway and like
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.520]   surrounded by smelly people. Like it's just it's just a different lifestyle. It's a different way
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.240]   of life. My office is right on Times Square and I had a lunch the other side of Times Square and
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.080]   trying. You know, I always said San Francisco was brilliant because there are two San Francisco.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.120]   The San Francisco the tourist sees the one the residents never go to. Folks, no San Francisco
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.880]   ever goes to Fisherman's War for Geordelian Square. Of course not. They don't ride the cable car,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.520]   right? So it's a separate city just for the tourists kind of brilliant. New York now has
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.760]   that separate city. It's called Times Square. No New Yorker walks through Times Square and hugs
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.880]   a Guatemalan refugee in an Elmo suit. No New Yorker, you know,
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.280]   except that one radio has a slice. Yeah. For the naked cowboy.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.640]   Oh, you're right. You're naked. That's the other one, right? No New Yorker doesn't need that,
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.600]   but I had to actually walk through its day and it's torture. We don't go to bubble gum shrimp.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.240]   Oh, any of that. It's true. That's the one's best McDonald's they didn't they?
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.400]   You know, we have in studio with us today, Ranger Craig. He's the ranger at Alcatraz,
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.360]   one of the Rangers and Craig do a lot of locals visit Alcatraz or is it mostly out of towners?
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.680]   Only when they have someone from out of town. If they're there, they're towing somebody from
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.520]   out of town along with them. He's been I've been of course to Alcatraz, which is a wonderful
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.400]   tour. Highly recommended. But Ray Craig has always said, you know, come for this. I'll give you a
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.280]   special behind the scenes tour and I keep meaning to drag the kids there and some I just never
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.000]   have gotten around to it. But I think we should try to do the show from there. One of the sales.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.960]   Yeah. Don't they let you in there in night tour where they let you kind of spend some time like
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.520]   extended time in the cells. Is there a there's a night tour? Yeah. I don't know.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.120]   Anyway, enough of that. Let's talk about this. The first phone with the word cyanogen
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.960]   on the back. This is the one plus one. The phone you cannot get from one plus.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:49.680]   They just put 5000 more invites on out. I don't. What do you say? What's your speculation, Gina?
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.680]   Maybe you guys have talked about this on all about Android. This is you know, they call it the
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:05.040]   what do they call it? The killer, the high end phone killer. But it's 300 bucks, 350 bucks for the
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:12.000]   64 gig version, which this one is I think. And it has all the all the specs of a high end phone.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:21.360]   I think this has a shot of becoming the new Nexus. And when I say that, I mean, the phone of choice
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.080]   for power users who want the kind of pure experience with a few extra settings, right? Like,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.800]   Sanogen is basically like stock plus a little extra, but not no crappy extras, right? And you
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.880]   still somehow and I don't really understand this. Maybe you can explain it. You still get Google
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.200]   services. There's the Google apps are on your play stores on here. Yeah, they clearly got Google
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.720]   certification, right? Because Google doesn't let any phone carry the play store or any of the
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.600]   proprietary Google apps unless they're they're Google certified. And with that agreement, I don't
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.200]   think all the terms of that agreement have been disclosed, but there's certain home screen placement
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.280]   and that kind of thing, right? So you're not dealing with an alternate app store, you get the play
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.440]   store and all that stuff. But it's cyanogen and I mean, the phone itself is actually, it's pretty,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.320]   it's gimmick free. I mean, it's a pretty straightforward phone. There aren't 17 front facing in for red
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   cameras. There's no scrolling on the back. There's no crazy. I mean, it's just it's just a flat phone,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.000]   but it's it's it's a high end phone. It's a beautiful phone and it's it's sleek and it doesn't
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.040]   have a lot of extra crap where and it's pretty pretty plain looking, but the geeks will love it.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.760]   It's like a Nexus five, doesn't it? Basically, it looks like a Nexus five, but it's
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:43.600]   bigger. It's five and a half inches. It has that silver ring. Okay. The back feels good, right? I mean,
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.120]   in the sandwich and branding, I think is powerful for for Android, you know,
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.920]   hackers and nerds. Now what we put what I don't know and I don't know if Jason knows this yet,
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.640]   is the bootloader unlocked on this? Is it unlocked? You know, yeah, Jason. He's not there.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:02.480]   He says he's pretty sure it is, but so it's kind of it's hard to figure out exact,
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.440]   you know, can you mind if I put it in a recovery mode, Jason? Let me let me let me try rebooting
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.840]   it because does it reboot into clockwork mod or or Torp or what? I mean,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.960]   Gina, for for I'm not saying that this is ever going to be a big phone with regular consumers,
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.600]   but if a regular consumer happens to pick one up and get it, are they going to be
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.920]   befuddled by any of this or to them, it looks like an Android phone that just happens to be different.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.000]   The bootloader is not unlocked, but unlockable says Jason. Okay, so it has go ahead.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.040]   It's a straightforward Android phone, you know, that that I think will be pretty self-explanatory.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.120]   The issue is how you can't get it. You have to get an invite or say it's weird.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.840]   Right now, I can find a few places. Expansis US apparently has it, right? And so does Panda Will.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.080]   Yeah, and then also, yeah, I found a few places at a premium.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:02.080]   Yeah. So what sounds like, I don't know how much the availability is. It sounds like they're
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.320]   somehow getting it from somebody got an invite maybe and reselling it. I don't know.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.600]   How does this need to be any reputable places yet?
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.880]   Right. Well, Expansis is reputable, but I by the way, don't see it on Expansis's front page.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.600]   I don't know. The scarcity is certainly working their favor in marketing.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.960]   It's a marketing thing.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.120]   Would you get this over the...
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.480]   The total starting from Q2.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.200]   Oh, yeah. It's been available like in onesies, two Zs. I can't figure it out.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:37.760]   Is there some constrainer manufacturer? It was at all marketing. It's all marketing is it.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.840]   And yet at some point, you've got to open up the pipes. There's no point in
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.000]   great marketing if you're not going to sell millions of these.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.960]   Well, right. Yeah. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.920]   We may be around about things as well. Maybe they're hand making them one by one, the small
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:10:09.080]   sweatsh
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.720]   may have, because I think the fine seven is the same phone.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.040]   If you put this exact phone out without any of the marketing hype and you just put it in the market
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:22.760]   with all the other flagship phones, does it stand out? I guess price wise.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.400]   Well, it stands out price wise because it looks like the other ones, but it's a lot cheaper.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.040]   Yeah. So half the price of the Samsung flagships.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.400]   The market price on eBay is running $450.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:39.560]   Even then, it's still a great deal. It's $150, $200 less than a comparable flagship phone.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.200]   I love seeing the signage and mind logo on it when you're booting it up. Now, this is, of course,
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.400]   we, anybody's rooted in phone and put on custom firmware is used to this, but it still, it's
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.280]   kind of cool to see it on a phone. And signage and stands to make some money because they're selling
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:01.240]   themes. So you can customize this with signage and themes.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.280]   It feels very much how are they selling those themes? Are those themes?
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.000]   They're not in the place. There's an app called Themes Showcase.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.280]   Gotcha. And they're typically a buck.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.880]   Well, wait a minute. Not here's a buck 99. Here's $2.23. Here's $3.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.480]   Maybe it's third parties that are selling this and maybe there's a signage.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.600]   So I had to quit the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 Google+ groups as all people did was say,
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.600]   "Look at my theme." I know, so boring. It's so boring. And when they say theme, they show the
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:37.640]   lock screen, often with a scantily clad woman on it. And icons that are look good, but you could
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:44.360]   never use. It's like, come on. You know, this is the problem when I get on the show. So now I'm
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:50.120]   ready to go buy this phone somewhere. No, no, stop. Stop. Stop. Because the Moto X plus one,
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:57.480]   someday soon, they said summer. That gives them till a couple months. The LG G3, a lot of people
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.720]   raving over this phone. It's got some it's the first Ultra HD phone.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.960]   Access six. Are we that's a good question. Are we going to see an X6 in the next in sometime?
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.480]   I mean, our dear friend Matt cuts and others said, don't don't don't despair the Nexus line.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.800]   Yeah, but that didn't mean we're going to make one. That's worrying because my
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.720]   sign just brought an X is five like yesterday. So he's going to be grumpy with me.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.520]   I see no evidence that there's a Nexus 6. I don't know. He's previous film was a Galaxy Nexus,
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.720]   which was three years old. So he's actually very happy with his phone. But he's yeah,
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.040]   if they come up with a better one tomorrow, he'll be gross.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.720]   Actually, I have to say, if this were in widespread, if the one plus one were in
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.960]   widespread distribution, easy to get, you could walk into a phone store. This is the
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.920]   replacement for the Nexus 5, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm saying it looks like an
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.560]   Nexus 5. It's that bit cheaper. It's cheaper and it's better screen.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:56.680]   It's supposed to be storage. 64 gigs. 64 with a price. So it's twice the storage. Okay. Yeah.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:02.680]   Then that's good for 350. How is time for an update? Right. Regular consumer buys the phone.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.400]   It works with Android. How does it get updated? Is it an automatic update or they have to go through?
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.840]   They've promised automatic updates. They've promised that within a few months of the L release
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:18.840]   that they will have L for it. A few months. Okay. What release means I would guess and
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.840]   Gina's going to correct me on this. But release means when the source code for L is released,
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.640]   not when the L is released, because then because they can't get to work on that until the source
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.960]   is released. Which is what is the lag? What is the lag? We don't know. It's been sold long
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.200]   since we've had a major release. It's a few months after they actually release it at the point
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.880]   where it's it's available to the public, then they release the source. That's the use model.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.480]   Yeah. There's the Google consumer release. There's the AOSP release and then there's
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.320]   cyanogen's release of their software on the OSP. Right. So there's going to be a little bit of lag.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   But I imagine that the moment that the cyanogen has been updated for L this moment, we'll get the
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:03.240]   updates, right? Well, the other thing with my son buying a new Nexus 5 was that it then said
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.240]   there's a software update. There's a software update. It basically made him run three software
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.240]   updates in a row to get up to four, four, four, four. That's frustrating. It's like windows all
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.600]   over again. Yeah. Badly done. So this pack three, it's like make all the diffs Google. It's not that
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:22.840]   hard. I have to say though, there's only one phone that allows you to get a digital tattoo to unlock
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:33.320]   the phone. This is so weird. It's a tattoo. Temporary admittedly that you put on your skin,
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:40.920]   they say it lasts five days. Like you unlock your phone, your Moto X only by tapping it to your
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:52.040]   flesh. Wait, what? Are we sure this isn't a real you could buy it now? Pack a 10. Yeah, from VivaLink.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:59.720]   Is it magnetic? What is it? No, it's an NFC tag in a it's really it's a sticker. Okay. And
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.840]   Motorola has done this for a while. So they've had the clip. That's the clip. And if you buy a set of
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:12.200]   these stickers, which I have all over the place, but there's the tattoo and it looks cool. It's a
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:19.480]   tattoo is a wort. It's a wart. I'm waiting for them to inject something subcutaneously that will
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:27.800]   let me prove your identity. It's really just an NFC. What was the science fiction movie where
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.520]   you had the port and you're in your wrist? Well, there were a couple of those wasn't there.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.680]   And the one where Logan's run where you had a little guy that would tell you, but then there was more
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.400]   recently one that actually would give you a countdown. Well, there was existence where there was like
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.880]   a port in the back of your neck and then insects went in and out. That was that was a good.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:56.600]   I don't want insects in my port. I saw a discussion on the Google plus Chromebook
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.640]   discussion that in dev, there were the flag you could set so that you do the unlock your computer
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.440]   with your phone that wasn't working yet. But I think it was that old too.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:11.560]   That's actually very risky. There's an app for the Mac called knock that lets you knock with your
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:17.960]   iPhone on your Mac and then unlocks the Mac. But it's very risky because unfortunately,
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:23.080]   when I installed on my Mac, Sarah Lane got permission to unlock my Mac. I don't know how,
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   but it's not what I would call secure. So that's a bummer. The movie was in time and then you were
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.440]   thinking of Johnny Mnemonic that I think was the one with a port where the insects could get in that.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:43.480]   Was I was I don't know Johnny Mnemonic. That was the cano Reeves is a
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.000]   Burke says it's existence existence. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Sounds creepy.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Existence. Oh, that's going back. 1999. Yeah. Okay. I'm old.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.120]   Johnny Mnemonic. He could still jack in. There were no insects involved. They didn't. Oh,
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.600]   so the insects was the key. Yeah. This is Cronenberg. This is Cronenberg said, okay,
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:09.800]   you are your body. We're going to send insects into there. David Cronenberg has a fascination
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:15.480]   with insects starting with the fly. Something creepy about Cronenberg.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   All right. A weapon against trolls. Could it be? Matt Cutt says he's created a patent or there is
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:31.240]   a patent troll solution called license. Yeah, he's not responsible. He's just explaining it.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:41.880]   License on transfer at LOT net.com. Companies like Newegg Dropbox, Canon, Google have agreed if they
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.360]   sell a patent, the other companies in the group will get a license to that patent. Oh, so it only
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:52.840]   protects you if you're in the group. I don't understand this. If you sell a patent depends on the license
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:59.880]   group, right? Splain it. And I need to read this now.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:07.800]   Well, I thought that was a huge explain to me. So this is what they write in there on their front
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:15.560]   page. Dear industry colleagues, had we formed LOT network in 2005? And if every operating company
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   had joined that year, approximately 10,000 folks actually becoming a cartel.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.960]   Yeah, I think this has got to be illegal. And how much does it cost to join?
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.760]   I kind of don't trust them because it's written in cold fusion. Oh my God.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:38.280]   Really? That's depressing. Look at the CFM.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.520]   JUDGE about programming. Listen, I program in PHP. So on the last person to be
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.080]   judgy about programming languages. But this website, I don't know, I spent some time on it.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.960]   And I still kind of don't get. So the idea is you sign an agreement, you execute it,
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.840]   you send it to them in Beaverton, Oregon. There is a modest, they say administrative fee.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:08.920]   Let's see how much it costs. Oh, well, depends on revenue. If you're a small company, less than
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:15.400]   $10 million in revenue, it's only $1,500 a year. If you're a billion-dollar company, it's $20,000 a year.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:25.560]   So the idea is this is defraze costs for anybody in the group that gets sued around patents.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.000]   No, they say they won't sue you. They say, it's not, they say we,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.120]   you have, you're basically buying a license. It reduces the value of trying to sue over a patent
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.360]   because so many people have licenses to it. Well, that's the other cost is if you join,
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:47.560]   you are now a member and you have to adhere to these terms. So when you sell your, if you sell a patent,
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.040]   absolutely, they'll reduce the value of that. This is like secondary blackmail. Okay.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.880]   So if they sell a patent to a troll, then you get, you get, you get,
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:01.160]   potentially against the troll for your 1500 a year. So it's a, it's a protection racket for
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:06.200]   people who like, large companies who have lots of old crappy patents that they want to sell off
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:11.000]   to trolls. Now, Google has joined it. Like Blackberry, for example. Blackberry is about to be this
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.680]   problem because they're, they're, they're going down the toilet, but they have patents. So they're
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.960]   going to sell the patents off to trolls. Right. And if, and in fact, if they had, they'd been a
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.400]   member of this group, they, they, they might have gone down the toilet sooner. But if they do that,
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.600]   then the patent trolls will pay less for the patents. Right. Well, that's exactly it.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.800]   Because they're going to say like the people in the identification,
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:38.440]   Matt cuts has, has stopped his run, has pulled over. He's, he's,
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.520]   there's steam coming out of his ears. You don't understand this.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.600]   Oh, he's on leave. He's hanging out with his wife. I hope he's on a beach somewhere.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.720]   I hope Matt's not listening. You know, we'll get a call from him in three months.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.440]   He'll say, Hey, I just listened to that. He put up a big picture of roses that he gave his wife
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:00.680]   and my response was just simply, well, so you did stop to smell them. Nice. Isn't that great?
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:05.400]   Good news. Google's bringing free Wi-Fi to New York City phone booths.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:13.320]   I was like, I don't remember where the closest phone booth is to me. And I have no idea.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.000]   I didn't. I didn't. They're still around.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.360]   Is it onion article?
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.720]   If you look at the picture, Gina, it'll, you realize that there are ads all around the streets
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.800]   of New York. And that's what a phone booth is now. See that? No, she doesn't. That look familiar.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   You see, you don't think of it as a phone booth. You think of it as a billboard.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:36.440]   Right. Now you're right. You're absolutely right. I guess Sandy did sort of make phone booths useful.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.400]   Oh, yeah. You need phone.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.080]   Well, there's no phones in any of them.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.720]   Because when I was working at BT, this was one of the things that I was saying is like,
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.560]   Oh, we have all these like big red boxes in the street. Wouldn't be great if they were Wi-Fi
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.480]   hotspots. They were like, yeah, that could work. But it's going to take a lot of changes to the
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.880]   phone booths. But it actually makes a certain amount of sense because the phone booths are in the places
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.120]   that they haven't been. They've been taken out of all the upscow neighborhoods already,
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.920]   but they're in the places where people still actually use them. So there will be a good place
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:10.200]   to fill in the Wi-Fi hotspot. And you get Wi-Fi for 85 feet at least around each site.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:17.560]   And phone service, 3911 and 311 calls. 311 is information.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.920]   The city is also encouraging people who want to do this to offer cell phone charging stations.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.040]   That would be useful. Short local calls for free.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.640]   I'm going to stand there and go to the street with my phone plugged in in time to square.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.240]   I'm not. And then I'm going to get have Elmo's coming up trying to hug me and get paid. No.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:38.200]   So you may wonder, you may think, hey, doesn't Bell Atlantic or actually it's now Verizon own
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:44.120]   those phones? No Verizon. And all the big telcos long ago gave up pay phones and sold them off to
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.600]   smaller companies. Currently the pay phones in New York City are owned by 10 different companies.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.200]   And the companies do have to French. I actually know one of the guys who does this. It's a very
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:59.000]   interesting business. He bought his his phones from AT&T AT&T. It was a small enough business
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   and growing smaller all the time. AT&T just didn't want to deal with it. He says for me,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.280]   it's still a billion dollar business. But for AT&T, it's like, who cares?
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:11.560]   And he says almost all these he's he's he's he services phones all over the country.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.320]   He's almost all of them are now cell phones. They're not connected to a landline network.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:22.120]   They look like a pay phone. They. Yeah, isn't it? It's an interesting business. He says, you know,
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.920]   he said, I said, we're nobody has, he says, well, look in front of Walmart in lower income
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.800]   communities in the Bodegas in the small stores. How do you use a phone card?
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.600]   He used to sell phone card. In fact, I think he still does phone cards. That's how he got
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:42.200]   into the cell phone or the, I'm sorry, the the pay phone business. And he says, really, this is
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.800]   what was really interesting to me. The real business is how do you collect the coins?
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:52.520]   Because people are using coins. So where this guy has this guy's great. I don't remember the
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:57.720]   name of the company or I give him a plug. He's he's the father of one of Henry's best friends at
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:02.280]   college. And so I was visiting Henry and I sat and talked to this guy for a couple of hours
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:08.440]   about the business. And I was fascinated. He makes a very good living on this. And what happened
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.360]   is that the key is being efficiently picking up the coins.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.600]   Well, there's the first user case I've heard from Bitcoin.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:22.200]   Maybe. I mean, I think you probably can use cards and so forth. But remember where these are
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.880]   and what and how they're used. People still want to drop a quarter and make a call.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:32.280]   You don't have a phone or you lost your phone or whatever. You need to use a phone. It's basically
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:39.160]   it's basically a loning you a cell phone for a fee. And he's he's actually developed algorithms.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.200]   He says very much like UPS, our trucks don't turn left. They've developed algorithms to
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.880]   efficiently collect the coins the more efficiently the more money you make. And now he's branched out.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:56.440]   He has become in many states the guy who services the Nestle's freezer cases.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:03.960]   Because the same algorithm used to pick up coins from coin payphones have become very useful in
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:11.800]   delivering ice cream sandwiches. And actually, this is the other thing. Those freezers are heavily
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:17.320]   instrumented. He says, I said, well, he said, we need to know when to bring ice cream and how
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.280]   much ice cream. And I said, well, you count them or something? He said, well, we do have sensors
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.360]   inside the thing. But mostly we just weigh the thing. There's a little. Yeah, you weigh it.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.520]   There's a little sensor and when it gets when it gets light enough, time to send a truck because
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:39.000]   we have all the flavors. Wow, that is interesting. The world is an amazing place.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.600]   And and there are all the I think there's lots of businesses like these where people, you know,
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.880]   say, Oh, that's not exciting or cool. I don't want to visit an entrepreneur. I mean, it's the
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.800]   real way we get so caught up with Silicon Valley entrepreneurship. This is a real
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.360]   opportunity. A real entrepreneur who sees an opportunity. Brilliant guy. Yeah. And and
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.400]   software is what made him successful because it's the software that tells the trucks where to go.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:12.040]   By the way, it's true. UPS does not turn left. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Because a left turn is time
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.880]   consuming because you get I imagine the UK where they don't turn right. Well, then they don't
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.200]   turn right. No, and they do it sometimes they're places they'll turn left, but the software that's
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:25.560]   routing the UPS driver or the ice cream truck guy is smart enough to let it turn left somewhere
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.440]   where it can be done easily and effectively like a one way street, but not where it will be turning
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.440]   left on a two way street onto a two way street because that's you got to wait till traffic gets by.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:40.600]   I imagine a guy in brown shorts who just decides I'm gonna I'm gonna be right. Turn here.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:48.040]   I'm gonna take a little break in the intersection. Yeah. Yeah, really. So
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:55.320]   related to yes, Google is offering free Wi-Fi and Uber black cars in Philadelphia.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:02.440]   It's in the rundown somewhere. This is smart. Google's Google's doing the little the breadcrumbs
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.280]   thing. You know, you don't have to make a whole loaf just add up enough crumbs and you get Wi-Fi
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.800]   everywhere, but you don't want to come up against regulators. Hey, it's just in the phone booths.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:18.040]   It's just in the Ubers. Well, I remember when we got to Metro wide Wi-Fi,
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:23.880]   Philadelphia went through a big project where the right string for starters at every phone poll
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.880]   and the government got involved and there were like five bidders and then it never happened. You
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:35.000]   know what happened? Comcast and Verizon and AT&T went to the state legislatures. They got laws
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.960]   passed in more than 30 states banning municipal Wi-Fi. Your old podcast Verizon speaking of phone
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.760]   companies, just Josh Marshall, who's a wonderful, wonderful journalist talking points memo was online.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:52.920]   He has a great tale today. He got a $5,000 bill, I think it was, for Verizon and he's not a Verizon
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:58.440]   customer. So then he tries to help Verizon to say, well, what is this? And he has to verify that he,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.560]   his number, but of course, he doesn't have a number to verify he's a customer to say,
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.520]   I'm not a customer. So we can get the bill. So it goes this whole day. They try to say,
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.720]   well, this is a government requirement to have an emergency phone line.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.120]   Say what? And then they gave that up. And then when he canceled two years ago,
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:18.760]   two of the lines self replicated. What? And they're saying that it's Josh's
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.280]   responsibility to pay the money. This is a sequence that's going to keep going on.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.560]   This is like slamming. Yeah, it's a it's a Verizon equivalent of the Comcast call we talked about.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:33.080]   Good. These companies are not. And people complain about Google.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:39.000]   Yeah, I've got to go through Fios. I just realized I was saying, one, a little slow at home.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.680]   I pay for 50 mags. It was the story that they're now going to go symmetrical,
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.240]   the same up, same down. Well, yeah, let me do a little talk check here and I can, I can, I can
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.640]   do a screenshot and put that up and be happy. But I'm paying for 50. I got 25.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.840]   No, now I got to go to the home again.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:04.520]   I'm convinced that Ryan Block Comcast call is something Comcast likes because they don't want
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:10.520]   to talk to you. And so what they really want you to do is dread getting on the phone.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.400]   They, I mean, we know this is true. They get, they get those Comcast reps get ranked down if the
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.240]   calls get too long. If they take too many calls, the worst thing that can happen is somebody calls
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:24.120]   once and then calls back again, because it wasn't resolved. Best thing to do, just don't call us.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.640]   And generally that's going to make a money because what do you do to call?
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   I need to call the bastards up because my phone, my comp cost bill is now $300 a month.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.280]   And do you not dread them? Do you not dread that call?
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:41.000]   God, do I actually want to go and do this today? No, I don't.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.840]   It's not worth my health. Literally.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.520]   I have what we're on the air and then we can troll them up.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:54.200]   I'm going to call Comcast tomorrow. I'm saving it up for a day off because no, I'll be on the
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.360]   phone all day. No, do it on the show. There you go. Yeah.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:03.560]   This is the courage for the service reasons. I will. Well, yeah, and by the way, you do have
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.120]   to say that in some states in California is one of those states you have to tell them. It's a two
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.640]   party state you have to tell them you're recording. I want to, I want to give them more money. I want
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:18.680]   to add Turner Classic movies. You've been trying to do it for weeks. You know, I do.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.480]   I tried on the website. Okay. There's no way to do it on the website. You can upgrade your
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.760]   package, which I have. I want to do. But as soon as you do that on the website, it says,
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:34.120]   okay, make your installation appointment. Oh, and but I don't need an installation. I just,
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:38.840]   so I, okay, I clearly the website, they want you to call them or something.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.360]   So, but I didn't want to call them because of Ryan Block. So I did a chat
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.800]   and I chatted, I explained with the guy and the guy said, okay,
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:50.440]   well, I walked the little thing. He said, now, and now this is half an hour later through this
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:55.320]   chat because you could tell the guy's doing 30 calls at once on the chat because there's long
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:01.800]   pauses and he said, you still there? And then, and then, and then he says, okay, now log into
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:07.960]   the website and add the package. I said, but I did that. Now it's going to want an installation.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.920]   He says, oh, just ignore that. Okay. He says, schedule an appointment. It doesn't matter when.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.920]   Okay. Now I'm very nervous because I know a truck is going to show up tomorrow.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:25.080]   So I schedule an appointment and then he says, okay, now, this is the Comcast chat representative.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.920]   He says, now, now that you've scheduled appointment, you're going to get a new chat with somebody else.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:35.640]   Tell him what you told me. I said, but I just told you. So now I tell him.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:41.640]   And so, and he says, okay, I understand. He doesn't say there's not going to be a service call.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.480]   He just says, okay, I understand. The other guy says, okay, first guy says, bye.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.640]   Bye. No, and then,
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:55.880]   another half hour goes by. This isn't chat. Another half hour goes by and they say,
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.280]   so you want to downgrade your service.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:05.960]   Ah, oh my god. No, and I'm so afraid that they're going to cut off my internet or they're going to
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:12.600]   do something bad that I just, I just connected. You should have just been like, OMG, FML, KMM,
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:20.920]   you're killing me. Chat that. So I think Comcast wants us to have PTSD.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:28.760]   They really don't want us to have any interaction at all because the likelihood is for them to,
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.760]   for me to go, oh god, 300 bucks a month. Okay, but can I face calling them this month?
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.600]   It's worth it not to talk to them.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.600]   A twin city's man is upset about the way his family was tweet tweeted on a Southwest Airlines
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.880]   flight. He was asked, he was on a flight from Denver to Minneapolis with his kids on Sunday.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:58.600]   He was asked to get off the flight because the gate agent didn't like a tweet he wrote about her
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:07.720]   service before boarding. The man Duff Watson and the agent had a disagreement. Watson says,
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.720]   I was left, you know, very upset, very embarrassed, very humiliated. He's an A-list passenger. That
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.720]   means he gets priority boarding, but the agent wouldn't let his kids board with him. Six-year-old
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:24.600]   nine-year-old, he said, well, you can get on, but your kids can't. And Duff said, all right,
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.200]   real nice way to, this is literally a quote, real nice way to treat an A-list. That's their,
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:34.520]   you know, priority guys. I'll be sure to tweet about it. And he did. He tweeted, wow,
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:43.160]   rudest agent in Denver, Kimberly S, gate C 39, not happy at SWA got down, sat down, the family
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:53.480]   sat down, they kicked him off the plane. On what? I mean, and then, and then they forced him to erase
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   the tweet before they would allow him back on. What?
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:05.000]   His kids are crying, literally six and nine years old. He said, there was no use of profanity,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.200]   there were no threats made, there was nothing other than, you know, a tense exchange between
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:14.760]   a customer service agent and a customer and a tweet. The customer service agent said,
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.040]   I'm going to call the cops. I feel, I feel threatened.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:23.480]   She said, you cannot board the plane until you delete the tweet.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.680]   Wow. Took about a piece of authority.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.760]   Scurice and effect for that one.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.280]   Southwest has apologized for the incident.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:36.760]   And the passenger says he's never flying Southwest again.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.240]   Apparently, oh, well, they gave him, I'm sorry, they gave him $50 vouchers,
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   which he can never use because he's never flying the airline again.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:52.360]   The new, the new corporate misbehavior is screw your customer,
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.440]   then apologize, say we're going to investigate this.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.560]   Yeah. That's crazy.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:04.600]   Well, no, but that's in it. The point is that they use the Twitter stuff for reaction.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:10.040]   No, that was my, yeah, I clicked on a link this morning and I got fished by Yahoo ads.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.680]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:15.560]   No, but that was lovely. So I tweeted about it. Now Yahoo, Yahoo, Concierge Services,
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.520]   even me saying we had tried to explain about fishing to you, it's like, no,
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.120]   this is what happens now. If you do.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   No, you are serving fishing ads. You need to fix this.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.280]   At first, when you tweeted, you know, Frank Elias and then the Comcast cares,
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.960]   at first when you tweeted, they, they, they jumped and they did something.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.640]   Now, and I, this happened about a year ago, because I remember I tweeted about Comcast
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.720]   and I got a call from Comcast executive, whatever.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.960]   And it wasn't a call to say, we're sorry, we're going to fix this. It was a, it was,
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:48.120]   it was berating me. It was like, yeah. And, and so that's the new thing is, oh my God,
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.480]   let's not fix the problem. Let's just.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.080]   Under what basis? What do they say?
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.640]   Oh, I can't remember. She was mad that I, I don't know. I hung up on her.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:03.400]   Jesus. Let's move on. I don't want to talk anymore about this.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.920]   I just feel like there is some, there is some trend here that is not a pleasant trend.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.040]   Everybody watch Twitter tomorrow for Leo's Comcast call.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:16.040]   No, I stopped tweeting because I don't want the, I don't want the executives to call me and yell at me.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:21.000]   I was just to, well, then recall that as well. It's just like, oh, it's an endless thing.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.200]   They're going to win because they're a monopoly. There's nowhere I can go.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   So we are held hostage.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.880]   There really is a fear that they would just cut you off just, just, just to, just to,
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.400]   just to F you. It's worth $300 a month not to get cut off.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.400]   See, I'm paying. Okay. So one of the things I, that's true. I don't, I don't come as a company
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.400]   or because I would be annoying. I spent a lot of money, $200 a month to go to Comcast business
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.280]   so that we would have unmetered 100 megabit service with no bandwidth shaping.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.200]   Oh, that's 200 a month. 200 a month.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.360]   I'm, I'm kind of seeing my domestic one and paying that.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:55.800]   It's great. It's worth it. And then, but, well, don't, wait because I thought, well, of course,
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.280]   Comcast, one company, they'll cancel the domestic.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:03.960]   So now I'm paying, even though I don't have a router, they came, they took the router,
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:09.320]   they put the business router in, but they didn't cancel my regular internet.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.680]   So I'm paying for 200.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.480]   It's not partial. Yeah.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.880]   And then I have to make a call.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:23.720]   And I'm not gonna, because I'm deathly afraid that they will, you'll can call, but I'm deathly
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:28.040]   afraid, at least at least who will yell at herself. But I'm afraid, see, what I don't want to do is
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.760]   come home and Lisa says the internet's not working because I canceled the, you know,
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.960]   you know, that's what's going to happen.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:39.640]   It happened to, it happened to, it happened here when I was in Paris.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:44.840]   I could call for my wife saying, the internet stopped working. I had to do with that Comcast
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.600]   chat thing in Paris going worst thing.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.280]   No, I do not have that information.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.920]   I can tell you where to get that information in, but I'm in Paris.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.760]   You just cut my family off the internet, stop it.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:38:00.200]   Coming home to Spouse Ridge, while like the Netflix spinner on your TV is going like this.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.120]   It's the worst way to come home from work.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.560]   It's not happening last night.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.560]   After all that Android, I went home and I was like, oh, I got the f*ck.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.360]   Why the internet sucks so bad?
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.000]   Yeah, get that one too.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.120]   Couple weeks ago, we actually called the Comcast out because the TV stopped working
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:24.360]   and the guy who came found that under the house, the hub that they plugged the
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:30.040]   UHF connectors in, who'd been under there for so long that like rats had nibbled it or something.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.040]   It had just got to the point where the TV stopped working because, you know,
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.000]   it's digital TV now.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.520]   So it just hit that point where there were enough bits being dropped that it could no
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.400]   longer send us TV.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.520]   We were wondering, well, I'm just kind of a bit slow.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.080]   And he said, yeah, this is what happened.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.440]   We're like, oh rats.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.480]   Rats.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.160]   So now they charge you for the service call?
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.920]   They didn't charge for the service call.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.800]   They replaced that piece and they unplugged the cables that were going to the rooms
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.840]   and they're only using so on.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.680]   Occasionally, you know, it does happen.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.720]   And I've had this happen.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.600]   You get that service.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.120]   And they're great.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.320]   And so it's not universal.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:01.880]   And I don't know.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.520]   I mean, Jeff, you got contacted.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:09.080]   I'm sure, but I got contacted by Comcast reps who anonymously said, well, let's, you know,
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.920]   it's not completely our fault.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.880]   They sent you to do this.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.560]   You know, your pay is dependent on it.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:22.920]   One guy contacted Mike Elgin and said, you know, what you don't also know and don't hear
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.240]   about is the software that where Comcast grew by acquisition and none of the software
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.200]   talks to anything else.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:28.520]   Right.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.120]   Yeah, that was the guy who said to me, right.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:30.920]   Oh, was that you?
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.040]   Yeah, it was a mess.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.960]   And so what you don't know is our systems are crashing as we're talking to you.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.160]   We're not allowed to say that.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.480]   Go.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.040]   Yes.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:40.680]   That's great.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.080]   That's about right.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.200]   The wrap in the field is not only untrained, but we can't even interact with them
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.600]   and give them what they, it's just a mess.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.160]   It's a systems problem.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.800]   Google is the, here's a good thing coming out of the EU.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:04.920]   I think Google has been told by the EU to stop calling games within that purchase is free.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:10.920]   Apple has also been told the same thing, but Apple hasn't done anything about it yet.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:17.000]   But we know these in-app purchases are really the big cost of games and sometimes
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.680]   cost a lot more than upfront costs.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:25.080]   So starting in September, the Google Play Store will no longer use the word free for any game
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.480]   that requires in-app purchases.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.320]   It also is going to come up with some targeted guidelines for games to prevent
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.400]   encouragement of children to buy items.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.440]   This is an ongoing problem. Apple got sued and settled a class action lawsuit by
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.800]   sending us all gift cards because of in-app purchases by kids.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:51.080]   The EU says Apple has regrettably not provided any solution or timetable.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:56.360]   Apple's response, Apple takes great pride in leading the industry in parental controls that
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.800]   are incredibly easy to use.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.880]   We over the last year would make sure any app which enables customers to make in-app purchases
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.280]   clearly marked by court order.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.040]   We've also created a kids section of the app store.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.640]   We've even stronger protections.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:12.200]   Our goal, blah, blah, blah, and we will continue to work with the EC member states to respond to their concerns.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.520]   So Apple's not too-
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.680]   Well, I mean, this is a, you know, a plague on gameplay, isn't it?
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.680]   That's really the larger one.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.440]   I mean, yeah, kids are going out and buying fish and, you know, every once in a while,
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:29.400]   I'll get about 10 emails from the iTunes store, each of them $2.99.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.800]   And, you know, these things happen.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.360]   The worst plague is you think you're getting a free app, and it's just unplayable unless you give them more money.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.560]   Yeah, it feels like we were talking about this last night.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.120]   There's kind of a difference between the apps that are,
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:46.760]   you know, effectively impossible to play unless you pace for something, right?
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:52.360]   Like you can do very, very limited, you know, stuff in it versus the apps that you can do,
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.800]   you know, a fair amount, but then, you know, but there's the-
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.040]   the word is the line, you know, how do you-
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.480]   how do you draw the line between those two?
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.120]   Well, we, in our reviews from F-
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.080]   I think we might be doing this in a more formal way, but have always,
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.680]   when I review a quote free app, I'll explain in that purchases,
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.800]   and I'll review it with a point of view of how playable is it if you don't.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:16.280]   I have- after my bad experiences with The Simpsons tapped out, I-
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.520]   It's not just- it's just not those games either, right?
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.200]   I just- Tim will rightly recommend an app, which is a very good app, and I'll probably pay for it.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.880]   I'm not going to resent the money I'm going to pay.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   I just want to be upfront called Sleep at Android, I think it's called.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.920]   What does it do?
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.800]   Well, I know.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.760]   It monitors your sleep sleep as Android, and you know, I've got, I've got, you know,
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:43.000]   these things on my wrist, I can't get to do that, but, but, but this, you put-
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:43.800]   this is wacky.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.920]   You put the phone on the mattress.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.480]   It's better. It could be worse. It could be in your underpants.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.200]   Let me go ahead.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:52.520]   Okay.
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.200]   And so because of motion and noise and the sensors,
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.640]   is the power of these things with sensors?
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:07.960]   It sees whether you- how much you slept, and the great thing is I compared it to my wearable,
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.560]   and it's pretty similar.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.240]   So it gives me- here's- let me see if I can find a graph.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.840]   So here's a graph of my sleep.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.360]   This is like the- you fit better.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.600]   Yeah, but it's- I don't have to wear anything.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:20.840]   Right.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.240]   It's interesting.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:21.640]   Here she is.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.600]   She's putting it in her bed.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.040]   Well, she's-
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.640]   Yeah, here's the- here's the other thing about it.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.320]   Wait a minute. She's sleeping on the bed.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.680]   So you don't put it like under the mattress.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.720]   You have to put it next to you?
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.560]   So it's on the mattress.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.040]   Next to you.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.520]   All the mattress.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.240]   How do we all the mattress?
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:33.800]   I tried it-
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.360]   So it's so weird.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:34.520]   It's a bit weird.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.280]   And I put it on the nightstand.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.080]   No.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:37.880]   Didn't work as well.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.760]   Oh, it has to be on the mattress.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:39.320]   Like not on the mattress.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.240]   It's best to see if you- if you wiggle here.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.120]   That's creepy.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.600]   And if you want-
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.000]   This doesn't really work if you have dogs, does it?
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   Or anybody in bed with you.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:49.960]   This is for the loner.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.080]   You're gonna be- that's true.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:55.240]   Here's the- if you want to, it will record your snoring.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.200]   Oh, I do want that.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   Go up.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.720]   Is it no who's snoring them?
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:43:59.880]   Yes.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.680]   Who said on that argument?
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.880]   It's you.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.400]   You're another question I have.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.440]   So I don't know-
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.760]   And any of these apps, I haven't-
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.160]   You know, tells me how much of my sleep is deep.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.640]   Nobody tells me what I should have, how normal it is.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.040]   Yeah, they-
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:12.840]   They're so funny.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.920]   They all say- like I've done this and it says,
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.320]   "You were restless 89 times."
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.040]   Is that a lot?
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:18.680]   Is that a little?
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.160]   I don't know.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.640]   It gives you zero data.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.640]   So I had- this was a good night.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.200]   I had 52% deep sleep cycles.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:26.680]   That's good.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.400]   That's very good.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:27.960]   You slept well.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.600]   Is it good?
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.760]   Yeah, what you're supposed to do now, but everybody's different.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.960]   Everybody's snoring.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.200]   You're supposed to say to yourself,
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.640]   "How do I feel today?
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.840]   Do I feel good?"
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.200]   Well, then that's a good number.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.240]   Do I feel tired?
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.200]   Oh, then that's why.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.960]   I always feel crappy and tired.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:42.680]   Me too.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.160]   But they don't take-
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.920]   What do you expect?
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.040]   Those of us over a certain age are tired all the time.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.960]   It feels like they could put those numbers in a context
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.320]   based on other users' data.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:54.920]   And that they should.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.400]   I'm going to say that it's the responsibility to do that.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.240]   I have a deeper version of apps.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.560]   I mean, I build an app that shows numbers.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.880]   But my argument against so many insights and think up is like,
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.920]   "What does this number mean?"
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.280]   Like, it's a tough D thing, right?
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.040]   Like without context.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:08.600]   Right.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.800]   What does 12 mean?
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.520]   You know, is that a little-
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.440]   Here's a nice feature.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.320]   So if the alarm goes off,
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.400]   it gets you out of bed.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.440]   You have a giant QR code next to the mirror in the bathroom.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.000]   And you can stop the alarm.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.800]   Or you can have an asterisk.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:31.000]   The alarm gets you out of bed.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.680]   You unplug the phone.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.960]   You go in the bathroom and you show it your QR code.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:36.840]   That's your wake.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.800]   Your wake.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.360]   Otherwise, you couldn't do that if you were asleep.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.160]   Like other things.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.600]   It'll pick the moment to wake you up.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.320]   So the other morning, it woke me up a half hour earlier than I wanted.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   Yeah, no, that's not cool.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.160]   Not cool.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.600]   It plays you lullabies?
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.960]   It's a cool app.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.560]   I'm playing so presumably a lot of these are in app purchases.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.520]   Well, so anyway, yeah.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.280]   So if you want to hold on to do something like,
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.320]   it's 4.95.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.520]   And again, not much money.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.920]   And I wouldn't resent that, but I just want to be upfront.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.280]   It will work with your hue,
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.360]   so you can have the hue slowly wake you up.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.320]   The hue lights could slowly come up.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:13.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.120]   The hue lights.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:14.760]   That's cool.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.800]   It'll work with your pebble.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.880]   So if you have a pebble, you can just wear the pebble Chad.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.800]   I wonder if it worked with Android.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:20.600]   Where that would be cool.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.400]   Yeah, I already have this app.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:21.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:22.680]   Oh, you already have it.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:27.000]   But there's a chance you can't wait to see this.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.360]   I don't use it.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.720]   The thing is, for a while, it's funny, though.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.640]   You mentioned it waking you up 30 minutes early.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:40.600]   There's kind of an idea that you should be woken up when you're in the light sleep cycle.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.400]   And so that was actually what I was looking for.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.760]   I just kind of got over that.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.840]   Well, just don't know.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.080]   You said what you're going to do is set a range.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:49.400]   Right.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.240]   And if you set the range, don't set it before you want to wake up.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:58.200]   Set it so that it'll wake you up sometime in a half an hour after you want to be woken up.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.880]   Otherwise, it'll wake you up earlier.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:00.680]   Exactly.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.160]   Exactly.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.920]   And that's what the gear 4 did, and I had an iPad app set up for that.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.160]   I just kind of grew out of that.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:12.680]   Now I just want to wake up when I need to wake up and monitor what time I go to sleep.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.280]   QR code just one of seats.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.840]   This is the problem is, and I know people like this,
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.880]   but they'll hit the alarm unconsciously, it turns it off.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.320]   And then you go back to sleep.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.480]   So they give you, you could do math problems.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:31.400]   You could shake the phone a certain amount, or you can find sheep, or you could do the QR code.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:35.800]   So it forces you to get, I think this is kind of cool.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.320]   So, but now I got to point out, I'm in the Google Play Store.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.520]   Maybe it's different on the phone, but here it doesn't show me what the
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.440]   in-app purchases are on the website.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:45.160]   That's my point.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.600]   It should.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.720]   It should.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.200]   It should.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.680]   The difference between this and spending $600 playing the Kardashian game, right?
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.720]   By the way, great game.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.040]   Because you can do anything unless you have the Kardashian game, is it?
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.960]   It's amazing how well it's done.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.640]   Yeah, it's wonderful.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.600]   I just read about Jezebel and thought $500 on that.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.240]   It's easy.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:03.960]   Well, that's right.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.720]   That Jezebel writer, it's easy, right?
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.840]   But you basically can't do anything unless you buy the K-Stars.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.840]   Abby's trying not to buy K-Stars.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.800]   My daughter is playing it.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.640]   She says a really annoying thing is it keeps any notifications.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.320]   Your fans are losing interest.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:17.480]   Quick.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:22.120]   Do something Kardashian like, you're not playing, by the way,
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.520]   you're not playing Kim Kardashian, you're playing her friend.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.720]   Or actually, you're not even her friend, you have to get to know her.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.280]   You're selling it yourself.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.640]   It's like Sim Kardashian.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:30.520]   Sim Kardashian.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.120]   I am so proud to say I have the faintest freaking idea, which we're all talking about.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:34.680]   Yes, you do.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.400]   I'm staying that way.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.040]   You know, you know who the car, who was it?
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.640]   Was it the, was there was a member of the-
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.120]   Right over there.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.080]   I don't know what this is.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.400]   There was a member of Congress who said,
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.440]   "What's a Kardashian?
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.320]   Is that a machine?"
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:50.120]   They're actually, for you, just like, they're an amazing brand.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.880]   Like, that's just erased every single platform, right?
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:57.960]   Like, reality TV, books, and then this app, the fact that this app is doing so well,
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.960]   it challenges my notion that these are not smart people, right?
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.400]   Like, these are smart people.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.880]   Yes, but it proved that foul split.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:06.360]   It's not a button on this app.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:13.080]   So it's John Dingell, who is among the oldest members of Congress.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.040]   He's 88 years old, apparently.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:23.400]   Doesn't know anything about the Kardashians, but it's fun to follow him on Twitter, I guess.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:29.000]   Yeah, I mean, Instagram is like, you know, is their thing, like they're-
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.840]   Here's, I'm the last original author of the Clean Water Act, but I have no idea who or
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.560]   what a Kardashian is, and I rarely play games.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.160]   Staff has now informed me of what a Kardashian is.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.320]   I'm only left with more questions.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:49.080]   I'm following him.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.360]   I love him.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.800]   Oh, this is good.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:50:00.120]   So, yeah, now what- now, I was going to check this on the phone.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.320]   Do they tell you on the phone whether there's an app purchases?
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.560]   Like on the phone entry?
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:09.000]   I just found another app for these people called Mindroid.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.160]   Yeah, what's that do?
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:16.680]   That it's an audio auditory visual stimulation device.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.240]   I need that.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.640]   A mind machine or a psycho walkman.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:25.000]   It provides each of your brain hemispheres with a signal, either audible or visual,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.840]   with a slightly different frequency in order to stimulate your brain waves.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:29.160]   Wow.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:35.480]   Then it says at the bottom, "Cautian shall not be used by users suffering any epileptic
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.520]   or cardiac symptoms."
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.480]   Oh, dear.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:38.760]   I don't think I'm bellowing that.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.000]   No.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.240]   Hey, we got to take a break.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.440]   I forgot that we have-
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.280]   This is a show to do.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:44.840]   I've just been-
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.640]   I'm just having so much fun talking with you.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.320]   This is really just like sitting around having a beer talking with friends.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.560]   Kim Kardashian, by the way,
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:58.120]   made 80- will make $81 million on that app this year.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.240]   You know, that's amazing.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.800]   See, that's the redistribution of wealth.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.720]   It's like the lottery.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.960]   Yes, there are no kind of wrong ways.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.680]   People are stupid enough to play the lottery, suddenly get lots of money.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.720]   She won the lottery when she was named Kardashian.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.720]   Yes, that's true.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.560]   You know what my daughter did not know,
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.600]   and what I think a lot of people who know who the Kardashians are,
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   because they got famous because of reality television,
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.920]   but you and I know that the reason that their dad-
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.120]   Yes.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.440]   Was the first Kardashian became famous because he-
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.680]   Was he on the defense team for O.J. Simpson?
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:33.800]   Yes.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.600]   I think that's what it was, yes.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.240]   So that's-
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.320]   I am in the midst of watching season eight.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.120]   I have just watched all eight seasons of the Kardashians.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:42.600]   Oh!
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.720]   Jada!
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.680]   Jada!
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.320]   Is it good?
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:45.720]   Yes.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:49.400]   It is- it is great trash TV.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.840]   I mean, it just is.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.400]   I- I-
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.040]   Shocked!
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.400]   I'm just shocked!
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.960]   You- you- you crushed me.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.920]   I thought you were so much above the-
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.480]   the- the- the-
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.160]   The flotsam of the world, Gina.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.320]   Oh no, you're human!
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.040]   I'm trying not to be-
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:09.480]   I'm trying not to be judgmental or-
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.240]   Oh, Heidi, Toni, you're over-intellectual.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.040]   I mean, the Kardashian-
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.640]   the Kardashians are a huge brand.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.720]   I didn't understand who or what they were,
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.240]   why people cared about them.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.880]   I started watching the show, and yeah,
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.200]   I mean, I sort of get- I get the appeal.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.600]   I won't go into my Kardashian thing,
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.840]   but I- I- but particularly with this app,
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.600]   I- I find them a fascinating brand.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.680]   I think that they've done an amazing thing
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.680]   across lots of different platforms.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.640]   I think there's like really interesting sort of interplay
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.160]   of like gender and media and like who's a personality
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.640]   and publicity and privacy and like just, you know,
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.360]   I mean, they made a show.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.480]   Oh, yes, Gina.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:44.040]   Oh, yes, Gina.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.560]   You've justified it all just now.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.920]   You got a wonder-
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.560]   You got a wonder-
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.120]   Hey, Kia.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.600]   What- I mean, their father, Robert Kardashian,
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.360]   was the first celebrity in the family.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.680]   Friend and defender of OJ Simpson.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.200]   He died in 2003.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.400]   You got to wonder what he-
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.560]   By the way, at the age of 59.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:05.000]   So- but you got to wonder what he would have thought of all this.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.040]   What are you- Yeah, and that sort of-
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.160]   That's a different theme.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.680]   Do they- Well, they were free to him.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.760]   Yes, they talked about him a lot.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.560]   Oh, interesting.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:18.200]   And so I guess so- so the mom was actually friends
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.680]   with Nicole Sipson, and was really upset.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.720]   It sort of contributed to their-
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.080]   Whatever, I'm not going to get into it.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.600]   [laughter]
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.480]   So they were-
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.640]   So then, and when-
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.040]   And then she married in Jenner,
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.480]   and then Kendall and Kylie were-
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.080]   Women, she married Bruce Jenner?
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:41.640]   Yeah, Bruce Jenner is like-
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.560]   Is her current husband.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.920]   Yeah, and then they had two kids.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.200]   Bruce Jenner the swimmer?
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.880]   No, the swimmer-
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.080]   Not triathlete, the race guy, the track guy,
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.320]   the 76 Olympic medalist.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.120]   Oh, he's a swimmer.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.160]   He's a swimmer.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:55.720]   He's a swimmer.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.760]   He- I remember the-
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.400]   And-
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.320]   Have you looked at his plastic surgery recently?
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.920]   Way out of control.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.800]   Oh.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.080]   Oh.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:06.280]   Okay, now we got to look up through his Jenner.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:10.440]   He is- according to his website,
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.200]   the world's greatest athlete.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.840]   Drag him into a city there saying
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.680]   "Tacky Americans, tacky Americans."
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.760]   DeCathilos.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.120]   He's married to Chris Jenner.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.480]   What, DeCathilos?
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:21.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.800]   Oh, he was- was Chris Kardashian.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.240]   Exactly.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.120]   This is-
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:26.440]   This is-
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.000]   Castle is pretty cool.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.760]   Oh, he was DeCathily?
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.720]   I thought he was a swimmer.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.240]   Yeah, I know, DeCathilos.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.120]   Oh, that- well, then he does-
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:34.120]   Wait a minute, Kendall Jenner goes-
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:35.480]   Topless channels are-
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.760]   I'm sorry, I've lost-
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.680]   I've lost- I've lost control of the show.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:39.560]   Yeah, I like the girl.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.040]   It's a good girl.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:40.520]   It's a good girl.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.000]   Just you guys.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.040]   Make some money, Leo.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.480]   I want to play this game now.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.720]   I might have to spend some of that money on
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.440]   Kim Kardashian, Hollywood's starlet, or whatever it's called.
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:52.360]   Superstar.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.320]   Superstar.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:54.520]   But it is not a cheap-
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:55.320]   Have you played the game?
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.840]   I have not.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.360]   I've actually resisted the game.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:58.840]   I'm going to put it on-
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.320]   on Jason's 1+1 phone.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.280]   Ah, ah!
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.720]   That's why I watched the show,
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.480]   so I don't want to spend any more hours on these people.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.280]   But I do find them fascinating as a brand,
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:08.840]   that has a market-
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.040]   Abby really likes the game.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.440]   She says it's actually a really engaging game.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:15.800]   I know.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.400]   Abby's 22, but you know,
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:21.160]   our show today brought to you by the one place in the world
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.200]   that wants to bring better websites to the world,
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:29.000]   better websites for all through Squarespace.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.240]   Have you played the Kim Kardashian game, Henry?
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:31.960]   No.
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.720]   At least one.
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.560]   Would you admit it to your father?
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.920]   Would you admit it if you had?
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.400]   My god, the entire chat room is like so disappointed in me.
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.520]   I'm really sorry, you guys.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:45.080]   [laughter]
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.880]   Now, Kim, if you want a site that never goes down,
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.920]   consider squarespace.com.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.600]   The best hosting, the best software,
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.560]   lets you design the site.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.440]   You don't need a team.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.880]   It looks like you got a team,
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.720]   but you don't need a team with Squarespace.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.840]   You start with their gorgeous 25 designer templates,
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.040]   but not nearly gorgeous.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.720]   What you don't see is under the hood,
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.520]   that these templates are engineered
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:09.320]   to be state-of-the-art web technologies.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.520]   They're mobile responsive.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.600]   That means they look great on any size site.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.320]   And look at that.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.560]   To get started, you don't need to give them a credit card or anything,
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:18.520]   just your name, your email address, and a password.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.120]   Now you got it for two weeks.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.400]   Play with the templates.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.280]   Add your content.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.040]   You can import your content from your existing site
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:24.840]   if you have got one.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.240]   And then change the template.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.800]   Nothing, you don't have to re-add the content or anything.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.880]   The template is completely separate from the content.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   That's another way it's very sophisticated.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:36.920]   Also, e-commerce is built into each and every template.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.560]   That's nice.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:40.280]   Squarespace is just fabulous.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:43.880]   I am so impressed with their commitment to quality,
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.720]   to their customers.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:49.800]   They have the best support ever all from their offices,
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.080]   which is nice in New York City.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.520]   So you're talking to somebody who really knows what's going on.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:57.160]   They're available for email in chat 24/7.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.960]   The customer help site has self-help articles, video workshops, webinars.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.320]   It's just great.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:07.000]   And you'll get all of that for free for the first two weeks at squarespace.com.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.760]   If you decide to buy, it's very affordable.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.040]   It starts at $8 a month.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.080]   And that includes the domain name for free if you sign up for a year.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:17.160]   They have apps, the Squarespace metric app for iPhone and iPad.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:22.120]   Let's see check site stats, like page views, unique visitors, social media followers.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.280]   They've got a blogging app that you can post, of course,
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:29.640]   but you can also drag and drop images, change layouts, monitor comments on the go.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.600]   It's just a, it's really impressive what they've done.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.480]   Squarespace.com, it's free to start.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.760]   Just click the Get Started button.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.240]   All I ask is if you decide to buy, you're going to get 10% off,
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.720]   but you just use our offer code TWIG.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:44.760]   squarespace.com.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:50.200]   Use the offer code TWIG for 10% off when you decide to buy.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:59.960]   Google's offering a million bucks for a better power inverter and inventors.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:05.800]   That's a long over. This is a prize, part of the Little Box Challenge.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:09.480]   Kevin, what's a power inverter do?
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:13.800]   It changes AC to DC, basically.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.840]   Oh, it's the brick that we have on every device we plug in.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:20.760]   Because AC is what's coming out of the wall and most batteries want DC.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:25.000]   What's wrong with the existing power inverters?
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   The struggle.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.720]   Good question. They probably waste too much power.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:36.040]   Yeah. We believe, says Google, that inverters will become increasingly important to our economy.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:36.360]   Wow.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:42.120]   As solar PV batteries and similar power sources continue their rapid growth,
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:45.240]   more broadly, similar forms of power electronics are everywhere.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.720]   Of course, in laptops, phones, motors, drives,
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:50.760]   motor drives, electric vehicles, wind turbines.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:54.920]   We expect that innovations inspired by this million dollar prize will have wide
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:57.240]   applicability across all those areas.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:03.400]   So there's a number of different kinds of inverters, I guess.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:07.000]   Can they also make them lighter?
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.160]   And you know they're wasting power because they get hot.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:17.400]   And we do know that inverters, if left plugged in, will use power even when there's no draw.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:25.720]   Whatever Google puts out these calls for either bug bounties or crowd sourcing
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:29.240]   invention, you know it's a really hard problem because with the brainiacs at Google haven't
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:29.880]   figured it out.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.840]   Yeah, that's a good point. That's a really good point.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:37.240]   I love this page for the little box challenge.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.760]   Littleboxchallenge.com.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.080]   Wait a minute, let me start it over again.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:44.360]   It starts with there squishing a truck.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.120]   Think shrink, it says.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.840]   And then a giant dog trying to get in a little tiny dog bed.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.560]   The Japanese, the Tokyo subway station where there's stuffing more people into the car during
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:02.360]   rush hour, a kitten in a cup, a using a host to vacuum.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.840]   I can't continue to narrate this.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.880]   So littleboxchallenge is.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.600]   Oh, sort of, sorry, I had it backwards.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:13.320]   It's the other way around.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.000]   It's the thing that makes AC from DC.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.320]   Oh, that's an inverter.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:17.640]   Okay.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.200]   That's the inverter.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:18.520]   Right.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.080]   Sorry.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.760]   So yeah, so it's it's.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.800]   Oh, it takes it from solar panels and batteries.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.360]   Yes.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.280]   And then it's your AC to run existing things.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.000]   And so, you know,
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.480]   from your car battery to make a laptop work.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.040]   Got it.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.400]   So this is something less common, but very important.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.360]   If you're trying to do solar, solar energy, for instance.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.720]   But if you've got, so, I mean, you know, the obvious answer is,
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.440]   well, why are we making AC when the things that are going to turn into
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.000]   DC again?
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.640]   So if you can cut the middleman out, that makes more sense.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:48.760]   You know, because if you're, we're going through this process,
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.800]   then we're replacing all our lights with LEDs, which actually want DC.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.880]   But they have to have a transformer in them to turn the AC into DC,
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.360]   because we're screwing them into AC sockets.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.320]   Can we mess up?
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.200]   Was that a some rate?
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.280]   Should we have gone DC?
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.880]   It depends what you're doing.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.320]   DC is better short range.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.600]   AC is better at long range is.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.040]   That's that's the whole point of AC is that you can have a power plant
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.000]   and out of the distance.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:15.240]   It can it can send power to distance because it's alternating the current.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.440]   So it's easier to scale it up to very high voltages and transmit it because it ends
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.880]   up being an off-slading transmission.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.320]   So you can it's a wave you can guide long wires.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.240]   But the DC is much better for short range because you're not, you know, you basically,
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.080]   when you've got AC, it's doing that all the time.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.600]   And you've got to like put it through a capacitor and clip it off and make it into
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.040]   a DC thing so that your, your screen isn't flickering all the time.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.240]   So thanks to our chat room, who are all experts on all of this.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.640]   They say, for instance, that you probably have an inverter in your laptop for the screen.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:51.480]   That hams are very notoriously hate inverters because they're noisy.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.080]   They put off a lot of RF.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:02:01.320]   They're used to export power back to the grid is what one of them says.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.040]   That's yes.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.960]   The other thing is that the grid wants AC.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.880]   And so if you've got a giant battery or a sort of thing,
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.960]   then you would need to basically give them away from what they like to look of to feed
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.440]   into the grid.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.400]   And Google's saying they want to get it smaller.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:22.040]   So applicants have to set September to register their team the end of September.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.120]   And then next year registered teams will submit a technical approach.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.320]   So you have like about a year to get working on this thing.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:35.000]   You have to July 22nd, 2015 in October, 18 finalists will be notified of their,
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   this is something Netflix did this with a Netflix prize where they wanted to get a better
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.280]   recommendation engine. I love this idea where commercial entities will say, hey,
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.240]   you know, this is so important.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.520]   We'll give a million dollars to somebody who comes up with a better way of doing this.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.000]   The X prize.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.160]   The great thing about that, but the Netflix thing was the honor of winning
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:55.960]   became so important.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.040]   People spent more than a million dollars to win a million dollars.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:58.280]   Right.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.000]   It's really Foster's innovation.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:01.960]   It's a great idea.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:08.200]   And there's a lot, if you want to know more at little box challenge.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.840]   But, you know, the other half of this is saying, well, are there ways we can like not need to have,
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:18.760]   you know, running AC around the house and then having like, you know,
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:27.000]   having something like this connected to every device you're using is less than I do.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.840]   And especially with LED light bulbs and like that, you're literally putting one of those
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.560]   into every light bulb.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.640]   Sorry, just because that's what you're running around the house.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.560]   And if you could actually run DC wires, the LED bulbs could be that big rather than the size
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.880]   of the bulbs they're replacing.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.560]   So there's a bunch of stuff that will mean that this will make more sense over time
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.560]   as we start running more DC around the house.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.960]   But this is a, you know, it's a transition technology as well.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:53.560]   I think it's not my light ever when I pulled that.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:59.400]   Apparently, I've just been informed that a visitor to our studio has brought me an entire
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.280]   pepperoni piece.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.120]   That's so sweet.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:04.760]   That's beautiful.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.880]   Good. I didn't want on Twitter.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.520]   I would have, the pepperoni industry would have been calling me.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.160]   But thank you.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:09.880]   That's very nice.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.080]   Actually, it would have been the ham and pineapple industry.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:20.040]   Google the day after we did the show last week, Google announced its second quarter results,
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:27.240]   a great quarter revenue up 22% year over year, 16 billion dollars.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:32.360]   They talked about the Lenovo transition for Motorola mobile.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.040]   And that was included as part of that.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.280]   Let's see.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.480]   Let me just look at some highlights here.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.320]   Net income, 3.42 billion dollars.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.840]   That's up a few hundred million from last year.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.480]   I'll take it.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.920]   Take it.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.440]   That's more than a billion a month.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:50.840]   That's good.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:54.600]   Discontinued operations did hit that a little bit.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:05:00.200]   Our sites generated revenues of 10.94 billion.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.720]   Partner networks or partner sites 3.42 billion.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.600]   They don't mention how much they made on Chromebooks.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.240]   The interesting to know.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.440]   Is that, oh, is that at the beginning of a smartass line there?
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.400]   Yeah, it was.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:15.560]   It was.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.720]   No.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:24.120]   One thing they do point out and get, no, actually, I like Chromebooks and I've come around to
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:24.920]   your way of thinking.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:31.320]   And they sold a million of the two schools last quarter.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.800]   One of them I bought for R6 greater Michael.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.440]   And it's really nice for 200 bucks.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.640]   It was the Acer C720.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.680]   Very nice.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.640]   That's a nice machine, right?
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.920]   Yeah, for 200 bucks.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.040]   It's amazing.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.920]   Did the school give you a choice of what to buy or the old school?
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:52.520]   The school gives, well, the school gives the students one.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.280]   Is it a one-to-one program?
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:57.000]   Or do they have a pool that the kids share?
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.360]   It's a one-to-one program.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.960]   So the school does have the budget.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:03.720]   I think partly through nonprofits like the Petal Losinga, two-to-one.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.040]   Two kids, one Chromebook.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.040]   That's going to work well.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.000]   That's a ton of it, yeah.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.120]   And then so we thought, well, they're so inexpensive.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.160]   Michael should have his own.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.760]   So we just got him one.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.480]   But I think that's great.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.080]   I think that's a really great program.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.520]   And they left at the Chromebook.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.600]   They get money from the Petal Loma Educational Foundation,
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.560]   which is a nonprofit, which we support for that.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.200]   So that's cool.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.720]   Income tax rate.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.040]   This is the-- I don't know how long this has been going on,
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.440]   but both Google and Apple are great pains to point out.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.840]   They pay a lot of income tax,
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.760]   despite the Dutch turnaround in the Indonesian, Polynesian,
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.920]   upside down cake or whatever they use.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.480]   21% the effective tax rate.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.120]   That's-- no.
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.320]   It's less than I pay, but it's good.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.840]   I think I once had an accountant who said,
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.240]   "That's about where you want to shoot for."
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:55.560]   20%.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.840]   Same guy said.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.480]   Oh, I wish.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.520]   Oh, take more deductions.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.920]   Plan for third.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.480]   Plan for a third, but pay a fifth.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.920]   20%.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.080]   What do you think-- yeah, we're in California,
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.120]   we're in a high tax state.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.880]   So this is--
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.880]   You know what?
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.040]   They say they don't say federal income tax rate.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.520]   They say our effective tax rate, so I don't know.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:21.160]   Well, that's the way they're counting across all countries.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:21.960]   I don't know.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.120]   Is that averaging between the tax they don't pay in Ireland
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.320]   and the tax they do pay in America?
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.400]   Next time I want you on that analyst called Kevin Marks.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.560]   Thank you for the pizza, my friend.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.200]   This looks like good.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.000]   Where'd this come from?
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.360]   Marys.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:38.120]   Now, if anybody wants to send me a Pepe's pizza,
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.920]   just fly out.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.840]   Have you ever heard Don't Look a Gift Horse in the--
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.040]   I'm so happy.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:44.920]   It's delicious.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.400]   I love it.
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.280]   Where ever it came from?
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.960]   Head count.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:55.160]   52,069 full-time employees of that 3,485 were Motorola.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.920]   I remember we did numbers on this show for Google employees
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.080]   when it was-- it had over like 20,000 as I remember.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.600]   Yeah, 52,000, huh?
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.240]   Geez.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.960]   So, you know, everybody--
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.000]   all the tech companies actually reported pretty good results this quarter.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.160]   I don't think anybody had a bad quarter, except Blackberry.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.840]   I don't even know if Blackberry had a bad quarter.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.960]   They might have a great quarter quarter quarter quarter.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:21.400]   According to--
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.000]   I'm not going to have to take a big charge, but--
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.240]   Microsoft had to take a charge for the layoffs
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.080]   over a billion dollar charge for the layoffs.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.800]   But also a big charge for the tablet.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.840]   No, they're doing very well.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:31.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.520]   They did that this quarter or previous quarter.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.160]   They took a big one.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:35.720]   That's good.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.040]   More.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.920]   'Cause they took more than a billion on the service
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.480]   a couple of quarters ago.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:44.280]   Recode.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:48.600]   Cara Swisher, the most powerful tech journalist in the world.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.200]   She can start a fire with her eyes.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:59.000]   She has used--
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.280]   But this was a fire she wears those glasses.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:00.840]   That's right.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.480]   She's used--
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.520]   She's used her mutant powers to determine
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.840]   there have been no Google Spotify acquisition talks, none.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:13.400]   Uh--
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:13.800]   Cara.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.840]   There you go.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.360]   That said, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Eck
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.280]   did indeed meet with Google executives
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.760]   about various substantive commercial deals
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.200]   at YouTube, Google Play, and Android.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.480]   But one source reflecting many others
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:29.880]   said, "Don't shoot me with your eyes."
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:34.040]   And there have not been a single conversation
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.640]   about Google's interest between the two.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.560]   There was never a price, never a negotiation,
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:38.600]   never anything.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.600]   Please don't shoot me with your eyes.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.600]   All right.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.320]   You guys talked about the Swisher,
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.520]   the New York magazine profile.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.040]   What do you think of that?
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.680]   We also talked about the L magazine,
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.040]   that profile of "Tabreeze."
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.120]   Did you see that?
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.240]   Well, no, I didn't.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.040]   Aw.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.520]   I'd have to bring that back because we wish you were here.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.680]   So tell us about what you thought of the--
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.920]   the picture of Cara on the beach.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.240]   That was great.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.600]   It was-- I really enjoyed it.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.520]   I learned things that I didn't know.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.120]   I thought, of course, the things that stuck with me
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:12.920]   were the personal stuff.
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.080]   Like, I didn't realize that Mossberg
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.160]   had walked her down the aisle
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.320]   because her mother was not supportive of her relationship.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.280]   That was interesting to me.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:22.280]   Aw.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.840]   I didn't realize that they had that kind of close
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.800]   personal relationship.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.520]   Yeah, it was a great piece.
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.200]   I mean, Cara has such personality.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.520]   She just makes great stories, so many great quotes.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.440]   I really-- Cara's quite a--
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.680]   she's been on our shows, of course, many times.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.960]   In fact, as I pointed out last week,
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.960]   those dogs that she's holding in the ivy
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.040]   pooped on our floor once.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.080]   [laughter]
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.880]   I like that she tells various founders
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.760]   that they dressed like Ellen.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:51.320]   Not that all--
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.920]   That was-- that's apparently her line.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.560]   You dress like a lesbian.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.880]   It's her line-- like she uses it on many people, apparently.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.120]   I aspire to dress like Ellen, so I would take--
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.800]   I think Ellen dresses quite well.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.440]   I do too.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.560]   I'm going to search for her stylist.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.000]   However, having said that,
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.720]   I've got to-- a little kudos to Google's top hacker,
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.760]   Parisa Tabriz,
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.200]   who appears to wear black almost exclusively.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.480]   It's slimming, she says,
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.120]   "strugging."
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.040]   Not that she needs to worry about that.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.040]   She has a simpatico face,
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.160]   always worn bare,
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.520]   that could easily elude
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.200]   from one ethnicity to another.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.000]   And a classic gap dash in dash
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.920]   its dash a day,
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.280]   sleek tomboy aesthetic,
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.160]   dark wash jeans,
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.360]   clean line crewnecks,
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.120]   and Chuck Taylor's with the occasional
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.720]   bomber jacket thrown on top.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.400]   This is-- we talked about this last week,
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.440]   L Magazine's profile of Parisa Tabriz,
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.440]   whose official Google title is "Security Princess."
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.640]   "Security Princess."
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:47.960]   Okay.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.680]   You didn't see this?
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.040]   I didn't.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.280]   I'm-- this is going into my queue right now.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.920]   But get that L Magazine out of the trash and read it.
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.320]   Actually--
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.680]   I know, I missed L.
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.880]   I always read L.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.840]   Do you?
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.640]   No, I don't.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.720]   Even close.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:02.760]   Not even close.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.400]   Are you kidding?
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.160]   She just appears in the Kardashian game.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.840]   Do I look like I read L?
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.760]   I am wearing a gray t-shirt.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:16.200]   Actually, but as Jeff and I concluded,
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.240]   in your absence,
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.760]   because we didn't have an actual woman,
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:22.600]   that this actually is a surprisingly good piece,
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.320]   part of L's Women in Tech series,
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.040]   that despite that one paragraph,
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.080]   which is a little bit much,
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.720]   really does talk a lot about,
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.200]   you know,
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.080]   some real stuff,
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.720]   and does promote the idea that women can be
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.120]   successful in an tech environment.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.640]   She talks about the challenges of that,
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.520]   and it's pretty good.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.560]   Doesn't hurt that she looks good in black.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.560]   I can rock those tuck tailors.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.240]   Oh, those tuck tailors look good.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.360]   I had no idea that L was doing a women in tech section.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.440]   I don't know how I feel about this.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.360]   Hello, L. Hello, L.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.400]   Guess who you're missing.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.360]   Oops, I'll be right.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.720]   Guess who you're missing.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.880]   I guess the L word, in this case,
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.760]   stands for lovely.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.920]   There's a whole article here from December
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.680]   at why we need women who code,
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:14.440]   featuring a movie star pretending to use a computer.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.160]   [Laughter]
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.520]   Copyright 2020 Central Fox.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.960]   Yeah, it's a photo gallery.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.960]   Yeah, it's a photo gallery.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.640]   Yeah, it always is, isn't it?
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.000]   Isn't the women in tech list always a photo gallery?
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.600]   They're so good looking.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.600]   You'd never know they were nerds.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:31.640]   I know, can you believe it?
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.920]   Can you believe?
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.640]   And then she took off her glasses and let her hair down.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:35.960]   Ouch.
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:36.920]   Oh, beautiful.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:39.720]   Why, Miss Tabriz, you're beautiful.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.760]   Actually, there is a good, a good article.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.720]   [Laughter]
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.080]   If you follow the links to why we need women who code
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.840]   actually does profiles of female coders and founders.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.760]   And it talks about how they learn to code,
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.320]   being a woman in the field and so forth.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:58.120]   So it's kind of neat.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:58.840]   Nice.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.120]   Yeah, I mean, they're doing something.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.480]   There's somebody from Code for America.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.000]   Some engineers at various companies.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.760]   Hey, it's L.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.040]   What did you expect?
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:08.920]   That's true.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:09.480]   That's true.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.680]   [Sighs]
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.680]   [Laughter]
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.680]   Let's take a little break here.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:16.840]   What?
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.200]   Nope.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.720]   I just want to make sure we get the right to be forgotten
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.080]   for my rant of the week.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:21.720]   Wiggle.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.160]   Jeff, we still have the change log, which we've missed.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:25.640]   That's right.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.080]   We're just, we're just.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.320]   Jeff's round of the week.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.800]   Coming up, but first let me show you my box.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:36.520]   This, my friends, is an amazing device.
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:39.480]   We've talked about Landtronics before.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:43.000]   They have a, their XPrint server line,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.840]   which takes any printer, even dumb old USB printer
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.520]   and puts it on the Wi-Fi network and makes it compatible.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.600]   Now, the first one we showed made it compatible with AirPrint,
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.200]   but this is the one you really want.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.960]   This makes any printer compatible,
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.680]   almost any printer, 4,000 different printers,
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.440]   compatible with Google Print.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:03.240]   And that is very cool.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:07.320]   Google's cloud print means that you can print from your Android
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.640]   or cloud device, but you can also,
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.000]   I could print to my home printer,
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.920]   because I use one of these from here over the internet.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.640]   This allows your USB printers to be shared over the network.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.840]   It automatically discovers them, sets them up.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.480]   There's no software installed, nothing to download.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.720]   You literally open the box, plug it in,
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:30.840]   and have a lot of you are printing via cloud print.
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:33.080]   The cloud print edition is 149.95,
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.080]   supports up to 10 network printers,
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:38.120]   and eight USB printers simultaneously.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.840]   We've talked to people who've used these.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.640]   In fact, I talked to an administrator at a school who said,
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.320]   "You know, we had printers all over the school.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.640]   We wanted to make it easy for people to print wirelessly.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.720]   I plugged this in and it was the...
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.080]   I'd never seen anything so easy."
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.960]   No configuration necessary, it just works.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:59.000]   It's really, really cool.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.920]   If you've been looking to get cloud print to work with your older USB printer,
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.920]   or you just want to turn a printer into a Wi-Fi printer,
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.360]   this is awesome.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.920]   It'll even work with the Chromebook,
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.920]   Chromebook.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:16.440]   It'll even work with the Chromebook.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.920]   Well, of course, because everything that works with the Chromebook.
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:19.480]   Android.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.600]   How would you even doubt?
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.480]   And the Chromebook?
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.600]   What would work with the Chromebook?
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.760]   Actually, it's more surprising that it works with the Kindle Fire.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.800]   It even works with the Kindle Fire.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:30.360]   Now, here is the site, exprienceserver.com/twit.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.400]   You can find out more about it.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.480]   And if you decide to buy, use the offer code TWIT,
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.160]   TWIT, you'll get free shipping.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:39.640]   Xprint, this is such a cool technology.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.720]   Xprintserver.com/twit.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:48.680]   Make any printer, even that old funky USB printer,
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.720]   a Wi-Fi printer that supports cloud print, that is awesome.
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.240]   Xprintserver.com/twit.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:59.160]   All right, let's do the change log first, Jeff.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:16:59.960]   Hold that rant.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.560]   Well, well, I will.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.000]   Yes, I want to eat some pizza.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:03.640]   It's time.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.960]   Play the trumpets.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.960]   The Google change log.
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:16.680]   And allies are gentle, then the latest from Google with Jeetah Trippenny.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:21.400]   Good news for Windows users who are also using Chrome,
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.440]   and the latest beta version of the Chrome browser,
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.640]   uses supports Microsoft's direct write API.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:32.440]   What that means for you is that typography fonts look really good.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.320]   You can see there in the screenshot there on TechCrunch,
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.920]   it's actually maybe not as easy to see.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:41.240]   You can kind of see the top one is without the update,
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.440]   and the bottom one is with,
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.480]   you can see the fonts there are much, much clearer and better looking.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.480]   So you'll need Windows,
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.200]   you have to be a Windows user on a machine that runs at least Vista
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.760]   in order to see this, and you need the Chrome beta.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.040]   So, fair enough.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:57.160]   And you want the Chrome beta because the old Chrome killed your battery.
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.960]   Ah, it was that true.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.920]   Look, the current stable version of Windows is a battery care.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:08.200]   They updated Chrome because frankly it was a, you know,
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.800]   yeah, it was coming people, Windows battery.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.080]   Was it just on Windows machines?
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.200]   Yeah, wasn't Mac anything else.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.120]   Oh, who cares about that?
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.680]   Jeff doesn't care.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.320]   Yeah, the Chrome.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:20.120]   Windows is like the Kardashians of operating systems.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.800]   Jeff is like,
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:26.440]   Oh, Gina, Gina, Gina.
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.440]   So you do need to be in the beta channel for not Canary,
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.400]   but beta channel for this.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:31.800]   You do.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.120]   You need the beta to get the good look at the box.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:37.000]   I don't know which version of Chrome is now fixed the battery life issue.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.760]   I don't know if you have to, I'll find out.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.320]   Keep going.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.480]   That just came out today, by the way, for this best week.
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:44.520]   This is not tight kit.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:45.400]   This is a different thing.
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.360]   This is for your desktop.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.880]   This is for your desktop.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:51.000]   This is Windows on desktop, Chrome beta fonts look much better.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.600]   It uses the Microsoft's direct write API on the desktop.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:00.440]   Google Maps for Android is getting an update that's rolling out now.
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:05.480]   A couple of few nice updates that are probably hooked into Android Auto.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:08.200]   So you've got some voice actions when you're in navigation mode.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.480]   So you can do how long until destination, show traffic.
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:15.160]   Bicycle directions now display elevation,
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:18.040]   including elevation comparison for multiple routes.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:21.400]   So you can say, hey, show me which route involves less climbing.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:25.640]   Your places now appears in a slide out nav menu.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:29.720]   The voice icon replaces the person in the search bar that used to load places.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:35.000]   And the Uber card now shows in the car tab of navigation instead of just public
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.200]   transportation and walking.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.960]   So Uber in the cities where Uber's available will show up.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.440]   So a nice update to Google Maps there.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:43.880]   And I believe that that's just Android.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:50.200]   The Google Play app on Android is updating to a new version.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.240]   I haven't gotten it yet.
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:54.840]   I keep tapping my settings icon and you can download the APK.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:00.840]   But it's the first introduction of material design that you're going to see in the Google Play store.
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:05.480]   So basically, when you first load the app, it looks pretty similar to what you've got now.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:10.840]   But when you navigate down to an app page, you'll see that those are redesigned.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:15.640]   So it's got the new material design animations and material design animations.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.240]   It's got a new white background.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:21.400]   You can see on the-- Chad's got that up on the screen there.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:25.880]   Apps that have a video trailer will have that prominently displayed at the top,
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.480]   bigger app screenshots.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:31.000]   As you scroll down where the page begins to gradually cover up the space
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.760]   where the trailer was, is pushed off screen.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.920]   That's material design motion.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.680]   And when you select Read More and the app change like at the top,
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:44.680]   you can see full screen view with the information about the app description and changes.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:49.400]   Just a much nicer app page in the new version of the Play store.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.880]   I haven't gotten it yet on my phone without rolling out now.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.240]   Andrew Police has an APK you can download or sideload.
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:03.080]   But I'm waiting for it to hit my phone over the air as the kids say.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:09.800]   Google Drive has been updated with filter views for spreadsheets.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.640]   So this is for real spreadsheet nerds.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.000]   Pretty cool stuff though.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.760]   There's a new filter views feature.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.720]   So you can sort and filter your data on view only spreadsheets.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:21.880]   And then you can share that filter view with a URL.
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:26.200]   So you can turn on this temporary filter view from the toolbar or the data menu,
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:31.160]   or the data menu, sorry, to make adjustments to filter your data and sort it.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.880]   And then you can share a link to that particular sort and view.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:37.320]   So nice update there for spreadsheets.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.560]   And finally ahead of the Android one rollout,
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.880]   this is part of Google's, you know, reaching the next billion users on Android.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:51.240]   Google's launched maps in Hindi on both the web and Android.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:57.160]   So the Hindi version of maps is available to those using Google Maps on Android version 4.3 and up.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:01.480]   So you can set Hindi as your language preference in order to access it.
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.680]   They've done translations that tried to stay true to the dialect,
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:08.680]   but also read correctly, but they are taking suggestions and corrections from users.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:15.960]   So makes a lot of sense before Android one gets released that India would have maps in the native
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:18.520]   tongue. So good for them. You know what?
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.520]   All right. Do you want to get is the Android one?
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:25.880]   I want to get an Android one and just show people how you can do an amazing phone for so little money.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.920]   This is this is not available in the US, but available in India or?
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.840]   Will be. Will be. Yeah, will be. Right. It's not out yet. I'm actually,
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:36.120]   I'm actually sure not when not sure when the release date is.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.800]   But yeah, I'm interested to get my hands on the Android one too, because it sounds like a really
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:45.880]   nice, slow and phone stock Google good updates. Yeah. So it's India and other developing names.
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:52.040]   So so maps will now support I have support for India native speakers.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:56.440]   And that play the drums is the Google change log.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:02.440]   So I've been doing research. A couple of things. First, they do not show.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:05.720]   It is good. Huh? Pepperoni. Excellent. Good choice.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:05.880]   Good. Good. Good. Good.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:09.240]   Choice. Love the pepperoni got to love the pepperoni.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:14.280]   Also, they do not show in that purchases on the Google Play Store, even on the phone.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.400]   They do that on Apple. I think that's something Google should do. Yeah,
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:21.400]   because it is. Show it. Lower on the screen. I thought it did and I don't see it.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:26.680]   What's the show? Well, I'm looking at sleep as Android that has in app purchases, right?
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.800]   Yeah, that hasn't an app. So it's like right below the the screenshot. No,
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:37.000]   I see top developer. I see rate this app. I see what's new description. Maybe if I
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.800]   had to show you, you've installed it. Yeah. Oh, maybe it's because I installed it.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.480]   Yeah, like right below the screenshot right there, it says in app purchases.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.480]   Oh, all right. So maybe it's because I installed it.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:52.120]   Oh, yeah, there it is in app purchases, but it doesn't show you what they are.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:57.400]   Oh, I see. Oh, no, it says here in really fine print right above how big it is,
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:01.160]   because everybody wants to know it's 7.62 megabytes. It says in app purchases, but it
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:07.880]   doesn't show you on the zoom in, will you? On the Apple store, it will actually give you a list
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:12.840]   of in app purchases and their costs, which is really nice. I mean, that gives you a much better
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:17.880]   idea. Well, what is this going to what is this could this potentially cost me?
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.040]   It'd be nice to see what is the average amount of money users spend on this app as well.
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:25.240]   Oh, wouldn't that be nice? Oh, that's interesting. Oh, there you go.
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.200]   Yeah, because that'll tell you how much you need to spend, really.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.120]   How much you could expect to spend? How much you'd expect to spend?
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.240]   How much is a typical user on it? When there'd be a great line,
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:37.560]   you can expect to spend $300 on this app over the lifetime of the purchase.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:41.560]   That would be that would really kill some of these freemium apps is for.
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.000]   Yeah, I think it's a blight on the app store, these freemium things. I understand the developers
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.280]   make tons more money when they do it free, plus in app purchases, but that's because they're
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:56.040]   drinking people. Well, right. Yeah, I mean, it's a little this leading, right? I mean,
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:59.480]   we were talking about it all about Android last night. I mean, the impact on developers,
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.040]   if Google's going to categorize apps with in app purchases separately from free apps,
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.600]   then that does hurt developers, right? Because users are going to say, I want something that's
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:13.720]   free. You're going to be taken off the top free list. You're not going to be listed as free.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:19.000]   You're being, I feel like you're being more honest that this isn't a free app.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.880]   But some in app purchases apps, you really can do a lot for free, and then they offer
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.960]   something extra. I think it's going to make developers really think, should this be an
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.640]   app purchase or should I just charge someone up front to use it?
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.920]   Well, that's why I like your idea. The average user has spent
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.840]   Instagram would be nice, too, but that's a lot of real estate. The average user has spent this
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:45.960]   much on this app is a really valuable statistic, especially when you like launch the Kardashian
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:51.240]   app at its $400. That might tell you something. Yeah, I mean, I would love to see that. And if my
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:55.000]   kid is trying to install an app, I'd like to see him. What's the average of players?
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.960]   Could this cost me? Yeah. So I also did research on the Chrome thing, and I don't think they've
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:07.320]   fixed it. This is from Tech Times. Google has finally acknowledged a problem that has been
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:13.800]   reported to Google since 2010 that a flaw in Chrome and accelerates battery usage in Windows
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:19.720]   laptops. It has something to do with the tick rate. When most browsers, including Chrome,
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:24.040]   are in active use, they run the clock at a tick rate of about a millisecond.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:29.480]   Maybe, maybe some one of you smart people can explain that to me. But when browsers are open
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:34.760]   in the background, but not active, all of them, except Chrome for Windows, just ease up. And
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:40.120]   they reduce that tick rate to 15 milliseconds. That cuts consumption about 25%.
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:44.680]   Chrome for Windows, 1 millisecond, no matter what background or foreground.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.560]   A clock tick, apparently, is a measure of how often Windows wakes the processor.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:53.560]   The processor sleeps while inactive, waking it predetermined intervals. In other words,
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:59.160]   having Chrome open on Windows will basically keep the processor going. It won't be able to sleep.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:02.120]   And this is something that's not so hard to fix.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:09.800]   And they say we have prioritized working on an update to fix the issue. So the stop
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.960]   gap, if you're using Chrome, close it. If it's in the background, don't put it in the background,
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:20.600]   just close it. Apparently, Mozilla and IE do not suffer from these issues.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:26.920]   On Macs, Macs work differently, so Chrome for Mac is not affected by this problem.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:30.440]   So there you go.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.680]   You know Leo, that white watch band?
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.640]   Ugly.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:37.640]   Looks like your retiree in Florida wearing white shoes.
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:39.640]   I thought it made me look like a Eurotrash.
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:41.160]   Oh, well, maybe.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.440]   Would you like to see my monkey?
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.160]   It's different.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:48.440]   I don't know.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.440]   So here's the deal on this. You're probably wondering, I'm
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.440]   we're talking about my Android Wear watch. I got the LG specifically because it has the white
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:58.520]   band. No, there's two. There's a black and there's like a kind of a goldish
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:03.560]   metal, but the goldish metal comes with this ugly white band. But here's the good news is a
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:07.720]   standard 22 millimeter watch band. So you can replace it with any watch band. So I'm just going
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:10.120]   to I just haven't gotten around to going out and buying some other watch bands.
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.040]   I kind of I wanted everybody to know I'm wearing wear.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:22.360]   No question. Why is Leo wearing that weird white rubber wrist thing? That's his wear watch.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:26.120]   Yep, you can strap. He'll be he'll be off for all soon.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.800]   I kind of like by the way, I kind of like
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:35.080]   we and her where it is definitely not anything anybody needs to run out and get.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:39.400]   But if you use Google a lot like Google now, like, you know, see, it's a birthday and shows
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:44.920]   a full screen, the person's picture from Google+, and it says it's had a Marshall's birthday today.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:50.840]   He doesn't have much of a picture, but I could see the Giants beat the Phillies in 14 innings.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:56.120]   That was last night, a game that ended at one in the morning. I could see stocks,
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:01.160]   see that my fire phone shipped. Hey, that's exciting. Nice. Nice.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:07.000]   These are notifications for various apps. When you slide this over, I can see, you know,
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.440]   what the high will be with the forecast is for four days and that kind of thing.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:14.600]   I don't know. It's got my calendar, my steps, how long is good. These are all
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.400]   Google now. And then it's got a picture, which is kind of cool.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.680]   Craig Newmark put up the picture by birthday message with on his watch,
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:27.080]   saying it looked fright. He said it was frightened. Yours was great. I loved it.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:31.080]   It looked kind of scary. Yeah. Because you were like peering over it, right? Yeah.
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:36.680]   This is a whole time when birthdays were like a big deal with the fence smoke.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:42.040]   Yeah. Right. Aren't birthdays a big deal? Gina, what do you mean? You don't celebrate?
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:47.480]   I mean, no, no, I do sell me birthday. I'm saying like, in a time, once upon a time,
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:53.880]   before social media, before I had this like really huge, like list of friends, right? On various,
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:59.080]   like like a friend having a birthday was was an unusual occurrence. But now every day,
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:02.840]   every day, three or four friends, it's somebody's birthday, not to devalue your birthday, Jeff.
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:05.960]   Happy birthday, by the way. No, I hate birthday. I hate it. I hate it.
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:09.640]   Oh, sorry. I brought it up. All right. All right. All right. Well, good.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:14.120]   Yeah. It's just not a big deal. Like it used to be if a friend had a birthday, like we were going
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:18.600]   out and celebrating. It was a big deal. It was unusual, rare occurrence. And now I feel like
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:24.680]   I'm just birthday it out of my goats. Internet, it ruins everything. Even birthdays,
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:28.840]   even birthdays, social media has really, has ruined birthdays. That's what I'm saying.
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.440]   Facebook specifically, but Google plus doesn't.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.520]   Now she makes it all better, doesn't she? And
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:38.920]   giving a stars my birthday people. I didn't know this. I mean, it comes the
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:42.440]   interway comes with a variety of watch faces. I just have a plain digital watch face as you're
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:46.360]   probably saw if you're watching the video. But apparently they're going to have a new API that
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:51.880]   will let you do custom watch faces. And I like the idea of having I mean, that this one on this
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:56.360]   side. I don't want to wait for that. I think I put on one. I got a new one. I mean, you can download
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:31:00.120]   them from the play store. I don't know how they're doing it, but speaking of the business.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:04.280]   Yeah. The API. Okay. Developers are hacking around the API and Google is actually asking
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:09.560]   developers to wait until they ship the API so that you can kind of do it the right way or the way
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:13.560]   that Google wants you to do it. This is what Wayne P Wayne Piakarski posts.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:19.400]   As we work on finalizing the API, we would suggest not posting your apps publicly to Google Play
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:25.240]   until there's a stable published API. So yeah, well, here's where'd you get that one? That's nice.
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:29.720]   It's called they got one called squares and they got one called circles for the wait for the new one.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:36.040]   And it's very nice online. But from a company called Smart Watch Face Company.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.840]   The only thing is I could be wrong. I could be absolutely wrong about this. But in my imagination,
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:48.200]   I think it actually increased the battery wear. Mm hmm. Oh, I'm sure about that. We made the battery.
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:53.000]   Well, I like that one, Kevin, which that's not a standard. That's the matrix one. Yeah, that's a
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.240]   that's a developer one. It's just like the matrix display. Probably should not download these though,
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:02.840]   right? Well, that, you know, you download them from the app store on your phone and then you get
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:06.360]   the show up is not between the watch. They've basically reverse engineered the watch face API.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:11.160]   And they're doing a particular harm. I don't think but they're going to release a proper version of
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:16.440]   the API soon. Now, well, that one's open source the matrix one. I'll find the URL for it.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.360]   Oh, cool. That's cool.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:26.920]   I look forward to a dribble being filled with watch faces.
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:31.960]   I think it's I I'm waiting for the motor 360. I want a round one.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.600]   Oh, yeah, we all do. Yeah, we can make a big difference.
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:38.840]   Well, and then and then we're going to see, you know, can Apple top this and it is topable,
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:46.040]   but we'll see what they do. I don't know. I'm I'm. There are those and and
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:52.280]   you know, everybody on Mac break weekly, I think is in the category of believers who think that
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:57.560]   Apple will will do what they did with the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad reinvent the category.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:02.040]   And then there then I'm in the other set camp that I feel like I don't know if Apple's got the
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:06.680]   mojo anymore. And I don't know if there's this is reinventable. I hope I'm proven wrong. I'd love
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:11.400]   to have something that I mean, this is right now just kind of nice. It's nice. It's nice.
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:17.400]   Apple's got an aesthetic and a sense of style that no other company has. And there's aesthetics
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:23.960]   and style involved here. So, you know, I mean, Apple can change this from like, this is this
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:28.760]   is pretty cool to like, I absolutely must have that because it's part of my identity. And it's a
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.520]   statement about who I am. And you know, it's a fashion statement. I think Apple's will certainly
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:39.880]   be more jewelry like. Mm hmm. Gina, have you lost it after an Apple product in the last year and a
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:47.320]   half? No, I mean, I'm sitting here on my Mac and and I, you know, my my iPhone, my development
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:53.800]   iPhone is is the is the little 4s. I've definitely looked at the newer iPhones. I guess as the 5s.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:34:00.200]   You develop on a 4s. I do. I just I just never bought a new, you know, whatever and have an iPad
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:04.040]   2 and there are times when I thought, I should probably upgrade, but there's such incremental
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:11.160]   upgrades. No, it's never been like, I have to have this not in a long time. I think I
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.400]   have to be wasn't less time on Windows weekly when you were complaining about your Mac.
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:22.120]   So I was on the Mac that I used for the show and I was going into the chat room to make fun of
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:25.320]   you and tell you to get a Chromebook. Yeah, but of course, my back crashed.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:32.280]   That's perfectly fine. And I can do things in the Mac that I can't do on the Chromebook,
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:37.640]   but I but I have a I still have my pixel and I was using it this morning. I like my pixel. I
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:43.240]   did. I think a Chromebook is a specific is a tool for a very specific situation. I don't think it's
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:48.600]   a universally appropriate computer. All right, we're going to get ready for our Rants.
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.120]   Oh, yeah, just one just one. But it's not that we've done often.
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:35:01.400]   It's rant time. Let's get ready to rant. Oh, I'll get sued if I say that.
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:05.720]   I'm going to get a request. He's a number really barely with the techno panic of the week.
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:10.840]   Let's let's quickly let me take a break and we'll get our Rants of the week. Oh, sorry. I didn't
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:16.520]   know that was a tease. Yeah, yeah. I didn't tell a graphic. Yeah, no graphic well enough.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:21.240]   You know, in just a moment, we'll have Jeff Joves is right of the week. But first,
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:28.840]   this word from Full Sail University. Full Sail offers both online and campus degree programs
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:34.600]   for giving you real world experience in the areas that I think people are really interested in of,
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:39.720]   yes, social media marketing, but also search engine optimization, web metrics analytics,
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:45.240]   online consumer behavior. That's their marketing degree. They have a online master's degree
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:52.680]   for people want to keep up with modern marketing skills, but they also have programs on entertainment,
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:58.680]   media, technology, Full Sail University's online and campus degree programs
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:03.720]   set around real world education and experience with industry technology and workflow.
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:07.240]   Through their innovative curriculum, you'll get your master's degree in a year. That's nice.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:13.880]   They have a launch box program. That's the project launch box that gives you a MacBook Pro
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:18.760]   preloaded with Apple's complete line of creative software tools, as well as degree specific sets
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:23.640]   of pro level applications. That's kind of nice. In addition to internet marketing, Full Sail offers
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.200]   a variety of master's degrees in related fields, business intelligence. You know, if you knew
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:34.600]   business intelligence, big data, you would be in big demand these days. This is an area that is
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:42.040]   just about to explode. Innovation, entrepreneurship, Henry should do that. Henry wants to become an
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:47.800]   entrepreneur and new media journalism. Sorry, Jeff. To learn more about Full Sail's master
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:59.400]   program in internet marketing or any of their related programs, go to fullsale.edu/twigfullsail.edu/twig
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:08.840]   for their support of this week in Google. The right to be forgotten. You know, the jury is still
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:13.880]   out on whether this is, I mean, at first I completely dismissed it as stupid.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:18.760]   Oh boy. I'm just winding you up, Jeff.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:23.720]   Oh, yeah. You're like a human, you know what you are? You're a human slate magazine.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:30.360]   But now that I think about it, don't you think some people should be, there needs to be some
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:34.760]   mechanism for people to kind of, well, you know, like the guy who's based in the Netherlands who
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:40.920]   wanted the Wall Street Journal to take out the fact that it did a feature on a tantric workshop
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:46.920]   that he had attended 20 years ago. Well, that's kind of legitimate. No, it's not. It was in the
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:52.360]   Wall Street Journal. By the way, my theory is he knew the Sinatra effect would come into effect.
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:57.800]   He wanted people to know he was a tantric expert in these certified ladies.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:06.120]   So the EU is now going farther. They've invited in Google Bing and the Yahoo. We're going to come
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:11.320]   in to have a discussion about this. And according to the Wall Street Journal, two, even more important
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:19.160]   things are happening with this. One is that now EU regulators are pressuring Google to stop telling
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:24.120]   the media properties and others whose links are taken down that they've been taken down.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:29.080]   So there's no opportunity to appeal. The free speech right of these organizations is clearly
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:33.880]   affected. Obviously, they're upset that newspapers, when a story is taken down, as in the case of the
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:38.680]   Wall Street Journal and Tetric story, do a story about it because they have something called free
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:44.760]   speech. They're allowed to EU get with it. The second problem is the EU regulators are also
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:51.480]   according to the journal upset that Google is restricting the deletions to the country domains,
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:59.800]   that the EU country domains, so that not across Google.com. So here's the EU, as far as I read that,
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:05.880]   saying, no, we want to erase things for the whole friggin world. Great precedent, put that in the hands
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:14.440]   of China and Iran. Aren't you people thinking? This is about rights that operate in transactions.
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:19.720]   And there's when you go too far with your howitzer to kill the fly,
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:27.560]   you're affecting other rights. And this is just dangerous and stupid. And it's not going to live
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.880]   forever because it's affecting media companies and it's affecting journalism. I said from the
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:38.520]   beginning that would, and I just want to say one more time, it's stupid. And I, you know, to me,
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:43.480]   I always focused on just the impracticability of it. It's one, obviously it's stupid, but also
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:48.520]   it's impracticable for a lot of reasons. I mean, they've already picked one, which is that this
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:55.320]   stuff is global. But also, how is Google to know? I mean, what's the process? Is Google supposed to
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:40:01.080]   set up a tribunal? Are they going to have? Well, there's a whole large committee now to do this.
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:05.880]   It's ridiculous. They didn't ask me. And they have, they have paralegals doing it.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:09.480]   And now what's going to happen to is now Bing is just catching up. Bing hasn't been doing this.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:13.400]   So now Bing is going to do it. They've been required to have. Yeah. Yeah, they've been
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:17.320]   required to go to the first. So what you're going to see is uneven enforcement of this.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:21.960]   So Google takes this down. You know, Google has rejected some. There was one example in the
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:28.120]   journal story of something that said to some kind of service company. No, this, this link may be of
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:33.720]   interest to people who were considering using your services, you know, as in, this guy sucks.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:40.360]   There was a whole separate case to having nothing to do with this in France where a woman was a
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:45.800]   blog blogger wrote about a restaurant, complained about the restaurant, and was fined something
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:50.920]   like 4,000 euro, some, some, some fair sizable amount of money. Oh, this is ridiculous. Because,
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:55.560]   and was fined more, was it was held more liable because she was more popular and her
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:02.520]   file, her, her, her post raised higher in Google search. So she was liable for being popular on
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:08.520]   Google. And her, and her post was really that she didn't think the service was very good.
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:13.880]   Although admittedly she was all over the top, the way she described it, but she's
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.600]   welcome to the land of free speech.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:19.720]   He's called reviews. I mean, imagine if you as a reviewer,
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:25.560]   for many years, we're subject to this kind of thing. We don't like what you said about our movie,
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.160]   our TV show. So we're going to have you pull it down.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.320]   There are still people, Leo, who want to tell you.
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:32.840]   If we're not liking Babylon 5.
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:36.040]   Well, and, and, well, that's true. But, and
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:39.800]   I built way, I was, I was sure something.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:43.000]   I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, how do they square this with that? I mean, how do they
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.080]   square this with the legitimate reviewers in, in, in the press?
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.320]   They don't.
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:54.520]   She was fined $3,400. She was forced to pull down the negative review on her blog,
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:56.840]   which only a few thousand people see.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:00.280]   It's just bizarre.
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.360]   Yeah, that's not okay.
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:08.040]   It seems a societal issue though, right?
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:14.200]   And what's really sad is she now says, I will never say bad things about a restaurant again.
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.880]   It's too dangerous.
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:17.880]   That's sad.
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:23.240]   She's a French blogger, Caroline or Caroline DuDay.
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:29.400]   The, she wrote, "The place to avoid in Cap Ferre, Ile Giardino."
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:33.960]   Even, and even, you know, she talked about the bad services over there.
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.600]   And even the guy who owns a restaurant said, yeah, we were having a bad day.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:39.480]   I, I, I admit it. But this is harming my business.
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.400]   [Laughter]
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.400]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:50.760]   She, she has 3000 followers. The court, a, a Bordeaux judge said that's a significant number.
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:53.320]   So, we're going to find you.
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:57.160]   You bad person, you. How dare you review that poorly.
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:04.360]   Can't people see the implications of these decisions? Can't they see the, the, well, you know,
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:07.640]   unintended, I mean, I, it would be generous to call them unintended consequences.
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:10.440]   They're just idiocies. But they have an impact.
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:14.440]   And incidentally, if you go to the way back machine, you can read the review.
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.040]   She took it down, but it's still here.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:19.720]   And, yeah.
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:20.760]   Don't they see this in our, like, right?
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:27.400]   Now it's a, it's an article of note. I mean, now it should be available because it's part of this story.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:28.360]   Right. Yeah.
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:29.000]   Right.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.760]   But of course it should be available either way.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:34.360]   And I could tell you, if I ever go to Cap Ferre, wherever the hell that is, I'm not eating
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:37.800]   an illegal Giardino. You're convinced?
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:40.760]   I'm convinced. She was silent, so it must have been true.
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:41.480]   Must be true.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:44.600]   It makes it more true, doesn't it?
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:49.560]   It just does seem like, I don't know what, how do you solve this though, Jeff?
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:51.080]   Courts will do these things.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:55.080]   You, you, you, you, you, you rule to principle.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:02.440]   This is the problem with legislating and, and, and, and doing court decisions to technologies.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:07.720]   Gee, the internet's made this worse. If, I mean, look at this way, would we tolerate, would the,
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:13.000]   would Europe tolerate the idea that you're going to every library and take out the,
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:18.440]   the library catalog cards for books that people don't want you to find because they
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.080]   didn't like it? We would never tolerate that.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:24.760]   So what makes the internet okay to censor books not?
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.600]   Because we think books are holy.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:27.080]   Oh, maybe that's okay.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:27.800]   Okay.
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.960]   Well, the principle would say, speech is speech no matter what the medium.
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:34.360]   If you won't do it in books, don't do it on the internet.
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:34.760]   Right.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:41.640]   And you, again, one more time, Europe of any place on earth should see the danger and damage of
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.440]   rewriting history and restricting knowledge.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:47.160]   What World War II?
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.360]   There was no World War II.
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.280]   What are you talking about?
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:56.040]   Jeff wrote a, a eulogy for, for, for Forbes, which is now.
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:56.440]   What are you?
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:56.840]   Ew.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:57.400]   Not quite a eulogy.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.640]   And you actually, you've got soul.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:05.160]   You talk about Louis Vorkin, who kind of, you said, performed a miracle with Forbes by
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:09.320]   rescuing the dying brand, but he rescued it by killing the patient.
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:11.400]   A bit.
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:12.440]   A bit.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:14.040]   Good article.
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.400]   A good blog post.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:15.560]   Yeah.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.480]   It's a little, a little media wonky for the show.
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.600]   Well, I'm a media wonk.
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.640]   So naturally, I'm very interested.
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:22.680]   The, the, the, the, the, the brand was dying.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.360]   Vorkin's a really smart editor.
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:27.960]   And he came in and he used as a candy for contributors to come in.
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.560]   1,500, I think contributors.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:35.240]   And again, I'm all in favor of being open, but equality was not of the high quality that
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.840]   Forbes journalists had had.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:41.880]   And then they also opened it up to advertisers under what we now see going all over the world
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:45.480]   in native advertising, so called, under what they call brand voice.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.800]   So when I see a link to Forbes on Twitter, I hesitate three beats.
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:50.680]   It could be a good journalist.
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:51.640]   It could be a good contributor.
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:53.560]   It could be a stupid, bad contributor.
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:56.600]   And it could be just a really worthy ad for an advertiser.
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:57.560]   I don't know which.
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:58.760]   And that affects the brand.
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:45:59.400]   It devalued.
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:00.760]   And so yeah, I did.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:05.800]   And, and they still managed to get, I'm, you know, I don't know how much money is supposedly
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:08.840]   valued of four-incer than a million, but they, they were going to try to sell the whole thing.
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:10.040]   They couldn't do that.
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:12.280]   They maintain a lot of stock.
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:14.440]   I'm guessing they probably got less than 200 million cash.
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:19.080]   45% or more of that went to elevation partners.
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:21.640]   So, you know, the things still alive.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.240]   You rescued it to that extent.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:26.280]   But yeah, I think the baby in the bathwater are out the window.
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:29.960]   And I, of course, always admiring your
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:35.800]   sujacity and your intuition and insight like the line where you say,
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:41.400]   and I can't wait to read this white paper you're writing that we have to shift to businesses
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:47.880]   based on known relationships with people as individuals and as communities rather than
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:48.600]   as a mass.
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:49.720]   And that's what we do at Twit.
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:51.800]   And I think absolutely right.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:53.640]   Oh, that's why people will put you to sleep, Garren.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:00.200]   I'm trying to finish the editing this or do my first run of editing this week.
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.760]   And I have to do it because it's what I do.
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:05.480]   You know, I'm in the university, but no, you don't want to.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:08.600]   But no, but this is what we kind of do instead of mass media.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:13.560]   You see that the title of the medium post is no mass mass media, which I like.
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:16.680]   But it's what we do.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:17.800]   We don't do mass media.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:18.120]   We do.
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:23.880]   I think of us as artisanal media, handcrafted for a challenging audience.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:28.360]   All the time. I met the new president of Guardian US today, and I was just telling him about the
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:29.560]   wonders of Twig today.
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:29.960]   Oh, good.
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:32.920]   I think it was a great example of how you can focus exactly.
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:39.240]   You can focus on, A, you can be entrepreneurial at a low cost, and B, you focus on communities,
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:40.280]   and understand what the community is.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:41.880]   One, keep your ear open to the communities.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:42.360]   Right.
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:43.400]   Well, you have to now.
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:45.240]   You really have to.
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:49.000]   And Kevin, March, you said you had something to rant about.
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:55.480]   Well, this was partly because I was listening to the show last week and you were talking about the
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.320]   Google+ real names thing.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.520]   That's why you're on the show.
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:47:59.480]   All right.
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:47:59.960]   Right.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:01.160]   I forgot about that.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:02.920]   So I screwed this up royally.
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:11.400]   Well, and the rant was the rant that I did at Google I/O Ignite, which you can play if you want,
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.560]   but I can give you a recap of it instead.
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:20.360]   And it comes down to the way programmers tend to simplify the world,
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:22.760]   and then get grumpy when the world doesn't fit this amplification.
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:28.600]   And that Google+ real names is a huge example of that, because it wasn't ever,
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:29.800]   you have to have a real name.
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:32.840]   It was, you have to have a name that our algorithm thinks is a name.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.920]   Turk was really...
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:39.400]   I accidentally started playing it, but we'll play it later.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:41.000]   We'll play it, play it if you like.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.280]   It's just five minutes to sign.
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:44.120]   That's one of the beauties of Ignite talks.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:45.080]   Yes.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:46.600]   They don't take that long.
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:47.880]   Yeah, I don't want to take five minutes up.
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.080]   You know, we'll play it at the end of the show.
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:51.400]   Okay.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:56.760]   So the thing you were saying is you were referring to it as real names and verify names,
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:57.560]   and that was not...
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:00.360]   That was only over the appeals procedure.
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:03.640]   The point was that if you put up a thing that they thought wasn't a name,
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:07.800]   then they would get into a argument with you over whether that was really your real name or not,
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:11.560]   and then you'd have to send government documents to Google and things like that.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:18.600]   Whereas what they had said consistently was you just have to have something that looks like a
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:21.880]   name to us because we want things that look like names because then we'll have a better community
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:24.600]   because people will think they're the other people, the real people.
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.040]   So all it did was incent the spammers to use American-looking names.
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:31.640]   So it was, you know, it was a disaster from beginning to end.
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:34.840]   I'm glad they finally stopped doing that, and that's good.
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:42.680]   But the sort of the presumption that it ever did anything to make a better conversation,
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.520]   I think is wholly unproven.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:47.640]   Okay.
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.360]   That's fair.
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:49.960]   That's fair.
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:55.560]   And I understand why they felt it would help, right?
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:59.000]   But, you know, they're supposed to measure these things.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:49:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:01.240]   It's just saying, "Oh, maybe that's what happened.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:01.720]   Maybe they..."
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:02.200]   Maybe they...
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:02.840]   "Face of everything."
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:04.200]   Well, yeah, but for three years.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:05.000]   Yeah, it's a long time.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.880]   That was an internal political fight, and I've got heard, like,
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:12.840]   when I started ranting about it on Twitter, I got stuff from people who googled at the time saying,
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:16.360]   "Well, the best thing is we don't have to argue about it internally at teacher AF anymore."
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:19.160]   [laughter]
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:20.920]   Well, it demonstrably didn't do what it...
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:23.720]   Because as you point out, Spammers just made up real looking names.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:24.440]   That's all.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:27.240]   So really, the policy wasn't to have real names.
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:29.560]   The policies have real looking names.
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:30.680]   That's not a very good policy.
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.480]   Yes.
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:33.880]   That's doomed to failure.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:34.120]   Right.
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:35.960]   And, you know, the point is you need to look at behavior.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:39.560]   You've got a chat room here that anyone could be any name they like,
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.800]   and half of them are like, Web X, Y, Z.
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:45.160]   But they get kicked out if they do something dubious.
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:46.840]   Yeah, we base it on behavior, right.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.840]   And the problem with that is that that actually involves things doing things.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:51.800]   It takes work.
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:56.040]   And that's why Google is wary of it, because they don't like doing things that require humans.
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:00.600]   We can do it only because we have a fabulous crew of volunteers,
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:06.280]   as many as 15 or 20 volunteers who spend a lot of time in the chat.
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:09.240]   And what we learned, of course, is that you have to make it on behavior,
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:13.080]   because bad behavior, whether it's in a real name or not,
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:16.920]   just degrades the place to the point where nobody wants to be there.
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:21.080]   And names don't-- I've long said that as long as we can--
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:23.800]   I can name aholes by name.
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:27.480]   Ergo, name doesn't stop you from being an ahole.
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:27.720]   Right.
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:33.560]   Let us-- it's time, I think.
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:35.640]   Thank you, Kevin, for correcting that.
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:36.920]   That's good.
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:40.200]   It's time, I think, to talk about our tip tool number of the week.
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:44.120]   Kevin, I'll let you do the honors, because you don't have an official role in all of this.
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:48.200]   If you'd like to give us something you're excited about--
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:52.920]   every time you've done this, by the way, it's been something that addictive that I'm mad about.
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:57.800]   No, the link I've just-- I've put it to you is just a silly thing that I thought was wonderful,
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:58.680]   and I think you'd like to see.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:00.680]   So just to look at my first link.
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:02.120]   And perfect for geeks.
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:09.160]   This is Ali Spagnola, who discovered that she needs to be wearing one of these at all times.
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:11.640]   This is some sort of steady cam for your beard.
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:15.000]   So steady cam for beard, so you can dance and your beard will stay stable.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.400]   Because you were talking about beard as we were waiting for the show to stand on,
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:20.760]   so I thought, this is something--
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.560]   Is this fake?
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:24.600]   Yeah, how does this work?
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:25.800]   How does this work?
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.080]   This is how steady cams do work.
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:30.680]   They isolate the movement of the chyroscopes.
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:32.200]   It's all with chyroscopes.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:32.760]   Okay.
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:33.800]   I don't know, Kevin.
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:34.680]   I don't know, Kevin.
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:37.160]   I'm not buying it.
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:39.240]   [LAUGHING]
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:43.320]   If we say we're to make this, I think it would be very, very popular.
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:48.520]   I've seen steady cams that do do that, but that may well be fake.
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:49.320]   Not that well.
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:51.560]   Yeah, that looks free.
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:54.280]   Oh, he's beautiful not to go tune in here, right?
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:57.640]   Yeah.
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:58.520]   It's kind of mesmerized.
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:52:59.960]   This is the guys like the Dancing Baby.
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:00.520]   Stop the poor man.
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:01.720]   He's doing this forever.
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:03.320]   I can't stop watching.
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:06.120]   That's actually a really good question I've been meaning to ask.
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:09.880]   When you stop watching an animated gif, did they stop moving?
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.680]   There's a tree called the forest.
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:15.000]   Does the light stay on in the refrigerator?
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.040]   I mean, I'm really puzzled.
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:22.200]   Like, is there a universe of animated cat gifts right now?
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:24.200]   They're just frozen.
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.400]   Doing stuff?
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:26.360]   Or they all just go.
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.280]   Or do they just all say, well, have a smoke?
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:33.240]   What happens to the animated gif when no one's watching?
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:36.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:37.960]   Gift like no one's watching.
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:41.080]   Gift like just call me Bishop Leo.
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:43.800]   Only Kevin will get that joke.
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:46.600]   And it's a very long way to go to get it.
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:48.760]   And we, you're--
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:49.240]   Yes.
[01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:49.640]   Yes.
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:50.520]   You got it though, didn't you?
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:51.400]   Took him a little while.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:58.440]   The Kevin's Ignite talk is at the official Google developers blog,
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:00.360]   YouTube channel.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:05.800]   And is it all of it on here or no, just your talk?
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:07.480]   Oh, no, you're in a portion of it.
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:09.400]   So you're 46, 26 in.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.640]   I put the link with my timestamp.
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:12.600]   Aren't you a smart man?
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:13.960]   Yes.
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:14.520]   I love it.
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:16.440]   I did it at Ignite talk once and I love it.
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:17.560]   It is--
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:18.280]   I--
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:21.400]   That's the other thing I would actually recommend to people is that Ignite talks
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.000]   are both fun to watch and fun to do.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.760]   They're fun to watch because you get 10 of them.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:27.720]   They're five minutes long.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.960]   So even if one's bad, you can just zone out for a bit.
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:32.680]   They usually come with beer and audience participation.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:34.680]   But they're actually fun to do.
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:39.320]   So the pattern is you get 20 slides that also advance every 15 seconds.
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:40.280]   Period.
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:40.840]   That's it.
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:43.960]   So this means that you have to practice.
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:47.320]   You can't just sit there and sound there and waffle and go on for an hour.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:49.720]   You have to make sure what you say will fit with,
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:51.400]   which means that the talks get better too.
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:53.240]   But then when you're actually doing one,
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:56.040]   you can never lose your place in more than 15 seconds.
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:57.400]   Next slide will come on.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.200]   So it can be comedic.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.720]   It's kind of like a slam.
[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:03.960]   And then it comes back in later.
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:08.280]   And Brady Forest runs these all over the place.
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:09.320]   They're often at conferences.
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:12.920]   I think they were invented by O'Reilly, weren't they?
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:15.160]   Brady Forest runs it for a variety.
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:16.680]   There was a thing called Petcha Kucha,
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:19.400]   which was the same idea with slightly different timing.
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.800]   By the way, it's not pronounced Petcha Kucha,
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:23.960]   but I cannot pronounce how it's supposed to be pronounced.
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.800]   OK.
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:27.320]   If you go, we'll come to the audience.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:28.360]   It's terrible.
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:31.400]   There's an audio present.
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.760]   It's because it's a Japanese word.
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:34.200]   It's something else.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.640]   It's like finishing yourself.
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:36.120]   Finish.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:37.080]   Finish?
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:37.480]   Finish?
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:38.840]   Okay.
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:42.040]   It says it was devised in Tokyo in February 2003.
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:45.160]   But maybe it's a Finnish name.
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:46.840]   20 images in 20 seconds.
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:49.080]   Oh.
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:51.240]   No, 20 slides for 20 seconds each.
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:52.360]   Oh, oh, OK.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:53.160]   By 20 seconds.
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:54.280]   It's 20 slides for 15 seconds.
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:54.840]   It makes it short.
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:55.320]   It makes it fun.
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:56.600]   I like it better.
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.040]   It is a Japanese term, apparently.
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:00.760]   If you search on Petcha Kucha,
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:03.800]   Pronouncer, the first YouTube video.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:05.240]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:13.400]   And then we get...
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:18.760]   P-C-H-A-K-U-C-H-A.
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:20.200]   I'll leave as an exercise for the viewer.
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:21.080]   Thank you very much.
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:24.360]   I don't know why this drink is so funny,
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:25.800]   but you got me without the thing.
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:26.600]   OK.
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:29.080]   You have to watch our video
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:31.000]   of what is it called?
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.600]   Pronunciation book, the YouTube channel.
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:34.600]   Pronunciation?
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:35.240]   Have you seen it?
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:37.480]   Yes, the one that just pronounced everything wrong.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:37.720]   Yes.
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:38.760]   They pronounce everything wrong.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:40.200]   Pronunciation guide.
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:41.160]   Pronunciation guide.
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:42.760]   YouTube.com/pronunciationguide.
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:45.160]   You can't stop laughing.
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:48.120]   We have a 10-minute video
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:49.720]   that I have shown everyone in the office,
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:51.160]   and not one time has not...
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:53.480]   Every single time I show it to them,
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:55.640]   everyone busts out laughing.
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:56.120]   It's...
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.000]   One of them is real.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.840]   So somebody did it real for real,
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:56:59.720]   and then somebody said,
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:00.680]   "That's bad."
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:01.720]   And they did a fake one.
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:05.240]   And I think it's Pronunciation manual.
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:08.280]   I wonder if they have petchecoucha.
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:11.960]   I don't know.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:13.880]   Pro-polio?
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:16.120]   Hilakitak.
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:17.880]   Pro-polio?
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.200]   Canolio,
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:20.840]   nanolio.
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:23.640]   Canolio?
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:25.880]   Nanolio.
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:28.920]   I wonder if petchecoucha's on here.
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:32.120]   This is...
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:33.800]   Duma.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:38.920]   It's good for...
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:39.400]   Jama.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:41.880]   Command.
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:44.280]   Jama.
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:46.280]   Command.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:50.440]   A-t-t-t-t-t-t.
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:53.720]   Whoever did this was truly inspired.
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:55.160]   Jee-jee.
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:58:01.160]   Jina, your tip of the week.
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:02.280]   I actually...
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:03.000]   Before I do my tip,
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.520]   I just got an email,
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:06.200]   the subject line from Amazon.
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:07.000]   Congrats.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.040]   Here's a list of your apps
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:09.480]   that have been approved for the fire phone.
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:10.520]   Yay!
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:13.880]   Yes, my app got approved for the fire phone,
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:15.400]   and I guess the fire phone's coming out,
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:16.920]   because you've got a shipping notification
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.680]   and I've got an app approval notification,
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:20.360]   so we'll be seeing the fire phone soon.
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:21.480]   I will get mine tomorrow.
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:22.600]   They announced it'll come out.
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:23.880]   It's going to come a day early,
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:27.960]   and I'll be reviewing it both on the radio show this weekend.
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:28.760]   I'll show it on Twitter,
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:31.800]   and then I'll do a full review on before you buy on Tuesday.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:32.360]   Did you see...
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:35.640]   The pogue has now hit
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:38.200]   the depths of desperation.
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:39.960]   Absolute depth of it.
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:41.640]   You've got to watch this pogue thing.
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:44.840]   Well, now everybody, as usual with a new phone,
[01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:46.200]   Walt Mossberg got it,
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:47.160]   the Verge got it,
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:48.040]   Gizmo got it.
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:49.000]   Did pogue get one?
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.840]   Where is it?
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:51.640]   Oh, I used to...
[01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:53.000]   It's on his tech channel, I'm sure.
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.200]   It's the word...
[01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:55.080]   David pogue,
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:56.360]   no longer with the New York Times,
[01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:57.800]   maybe he doesn't get these things.
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:00.520]   Oh, a spark of potential?
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:01.160]   Is it that one?
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:03.000]   Jay Roar, is that...
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.400]   He plays an old professor or something?
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:08.040]   David really is a character.
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:09.240]   Oh, it's really just...
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:09.880]   This is the ad.
[01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:11.320]   We're going to have to skip the ad, but...
[01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:13.400]   Desperate thing you've ever seen,
[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:15.960]   Jay Roar's tweeted me tweet it today.
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:17.080]   He's like, "I'm going to find it."
[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:18.120]   Do you meet your video?
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:18.840]   I can play it.
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:19.400]   Okay, go ahead.
[01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:22.280]   This is done.
[01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:23.320]   In the touchscreen phone era,
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:25.240]   gestures have taken on a new meeting.
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:26.120]   No, this is not it.
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:28.280]   No, no, this is beyond...
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:29.080]   Have a game.
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:30.280]   Beyond belief.
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:32.200]   How awful it is.
[01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:32.840]   It's I can.
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:34.760]   You know, I got a review unit too, by the way,
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:35.320]   on the list.
[01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:36.040]   With a fire phone.
[01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:36.680]   A box came.
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:37.400]   I was so excited.
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:38.520]   I opened it on Saturday.
[01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:39.160]   It was very excited,
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:41.320]   UPS box from AT&T Dallas.
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:42.760]   Inside, I opened it.
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:43.560]   I didn't know what to expect,
[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:44.600]   because I didn't know what was going to come.
[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:45.640]   They didn't tell me at a time.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:46.040]   I opened up...
[01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:47.560]   Oh, there's a fire phone inside.
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:49.080]   I opened up there was no phone in the box.
[01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:50.600]   What?
[01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:51.080]   What?
[01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:51.800]   It's an empty box.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:54.920]   They...
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:57.160]   We contacted the people.
[01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:59.400]   The PR company.
[01:59:59.400 --> 01:59:59.960]   They said,
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:01.400]   "What? No, we sent you a phone.
[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:03.080]   UPS must have stolen it.
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:03.800]   I don't think so.
[02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:05.560]   I don't think so.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:07.880]   I looked at it and it was nicely sealed.
[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:09.480]   Anyway, we sent it all back to them and said,
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:10.200]   "You figure it out.
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:11.320]   There was no phone in here."
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:13.800]   Fortunately, I videoed the opening of it,
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:15.960]   so that I have proof that I did not know
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:16.600]   slightly the fan.
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:17.480]   Oh, you did an unboxing.
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:18.280]   That's more hard.
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:18.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:21.000]   [Laughter]
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.200]   Okay.
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.000]   All right.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:23.560]   All right.
[02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:23.880]   All right.
[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:24.280]   Here it is.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:27.080]   I got the link here in the chat room.
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:28.200]   Thank you, Scooter X.
[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:28.920]   It's a smart watch.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:29.320]   I'm sorry.
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:30.280]   It's a smart watch.
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:31.240]   Oh, smart watch.
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:31.960]   This is not it.
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:32.840]   That was...
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:33.800]   Smartwatch OS.
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:37.240]   That was the Wompossburg review of the fire phone.
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:38.840]   He thought it was...
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:40.040]   I would pretty much agree with him.
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:40.680]   He thought it was
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.840]   nothing to get excited about.
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:45.800]   All right.
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:46.680]   Keep going, Gina.
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:47.480]   What else?
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:47.720]   Yeah.
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:48.680]   Let me do my tip.
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:49.480]   My tip.
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:53.880]   And I realize that we haven't talked a lot about Bitcoin
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:54.840]   here on this show.
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:55.480]   Not.
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:57.160]   I'm not sure why.
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:59.400]   I'm sort of fascinated by Bitcoin,
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.880]   mostly because of the technology versus the sort of,
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.000]   the gold digging community.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.240]   I feel like they're the technologists and the gold diggers.
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:08.840]   I'm more on the technology side of it,
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.280]   because it is a fascinating technology.
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:15.320]   But Google now supports Bitcoin conversions from the search box.
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:16.920]   I'm not sure if you covered this in last week's show,
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:17.640]   and I wasn't here.
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:21.000]   But you can go to the Google search box.
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:21.800]   You probably already know.
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:24.280]   You can do currency conversion for all different kinds of currencies.
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.000]   So you can say,
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.560]   "10 US dollars in euro."
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:28.680]   And I'll tell you how many euros.
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:33.880]   Well, now you can do 10 USD in BTSC or in BTSC.
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:36.040]   So BTSC is the abbreviation for Bitcoin.
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:38.280]   BTSC is for Bitcoin, yes.
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:42.040]   So you can see how much Bitcoin converts to US dollars.
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:42.440]   And this is...
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:45.320]   And a graph of how you're losing money in Bitcoin.
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:47.640]   And a graph of how you're losing money in Bitcoin.
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:51.000]   Actually, that's actually vice versa, how you're gaining money now.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:51.640]   How you're gaining?
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:52.360]   It's getting...
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:53.240]   1 Bitcoin, 620 bucks.
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:55.400]   It's kind of stabilized around that number four.
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:57.320]   It's kind of stabilized around 600, yeah.
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:59.480]   And this is courtesy of Coinbase,
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:00.920]   which is a kind of...
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:04.200]   Which is a pretty good Bitcoin while it's...
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:07.240]   That's the one I use, I think.
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:09.240]   I can't remember.
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:11.640]   But they don't translate those coin.
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:12.920]   They don't...
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:14.360]   Nobody translates those coin.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:17.240]   That's why we use Dogecoin.
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:20.360]   We don't want to be part of the corporate oligarchical structure.
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:23.960]   Once Google started doing this,
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:28.280]   I tried to add BTSC to my stocks on Google now.
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:31.560]   And it wasn't an option, but it just never shows up.
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:34.120]   So I could go in my stock settings and put BTSC.
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:36.520]   So it's not a stock.
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:37.800]   Right, it's a virtual currency.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:39.400]   But it's kind of interesting to see Google...
[02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:44.200]   It feels like a moment of mainstreaminess Bitcoin.
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:47.480]   But it's quite the...
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:48.280]   What do you call them?
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:50.760]   The twins along with...
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.120]   Oh, the Vincarvi.
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:54.200]   The Vincarvi twins.
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:56.120]   A launching exchange traded Bitcoin fund,
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:57.160]   whose symbol will be coin.
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:02:59.800]   COIN, really?
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:01.160]   On the...
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:01.720]   Yes.
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:03.640]   So you can buy Bitcoin over the counter...
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:04.280]   Oh, Lord.
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:05.480]   From Etrader, whatever.
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:06.760]   Oh, from Etrader, whatever.
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:07.400]   Yeah.
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:08.120]   I'm figuring...
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:09.480]   So in the same way, you've got DollarTraki ones,
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:10.440]   they were there with the Bitcoin,
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:10.920]   tracking one of them.
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:12.760]   They'd be going through the regulatory nonsense to do that.
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:14.520]   If any's going to be able to make money in Bitcoin,
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:15.960]   it'll be the VincalVoss twins.
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:19.880]   Jeff, you have a number?
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:22.760]   Yeah, I want to mention this first,
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:23.640]   that the F...
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:25.640]   God bless you, America.
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:32.200]   1,067,79 people sent comments to the FCC about net neutrality.
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:35.560]   If you want to feel a little bad about democracy,
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:40.840]   that's less than 1.4 million that went to the FCC over Janet Jackson's nipple.
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:46.600]   But let's remember that was mainly about angry bots setting the message.
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:47.480]   Oh, really?
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:47.960]   Is that true?
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:48.440]   Is that true?
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:52.120]   The wardrobe malfunction at the Super Bowl,
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:53.720]   the complaints were coming from bots?
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:56.920]   Well, in essence, parents told them television people.
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:00.600]   Oh, yeah, they were people, but they were people without a lot of their own.
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.520]   So this week, I'll give you a choice, Leo.
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:02.840]   Okay.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:08.440]   The 10 questions that are now banned from Google interviews,
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:09.480]   because they were too stupid,
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:13.320]   or 15 top Eric Schmidisms.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:14.920]   Oh, God, those are both great.
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:16.440]   How can I pick?
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:18.600]   Can you do one from each?
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:22.680]   Oh, I just go, why don't you go to the Schmidisms and pick?
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:26.280]   You're gonna put this on me, yeah?
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:26.840]   You're gonna put this on me here.
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:28.760]   A lot of what he says, he's right about,
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:31.640]   and it's wrong, and he says, he said to me once,
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:34.440]   it's death by Twitter, it's out of context.
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:36.040]   Nonetheless, they're pretty funny.
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:38.680]   I don't know, I think...
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:40.120]   Some of them are very funny.
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:43.080]   After I complain so much about crappy CEO interviews
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:44.440]   that I really should support this.
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:48.760]   Here's a guy who speaks his mind, however crazy it is.
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:51.720]   One day we had a conversation where we figured out
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:54.440]   we could just try and predict the stock market,
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:57.160]   and then we decided it was illegal, so we stopped doing that.
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:04:58.120]   Yeah, I feel like that.
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:01.080]   The pictures help.
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:02.520]   They do.
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:04.760]   Google's staggering collection of personal info.
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:06.520]   Would you prefer someone else?
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:07.800]   Is there a government?
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:09.240]   You would prefer to be in charge of this.
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:11.480]   Which I actually agree with.
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:12.440]   Yeah, I see why people...
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:14.600]   I'm getting caught on Google Street View.
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:17.880]   Yeah, with Street View we drive by exactly once,
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:19.080]   so you could just move.
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:23.480]   We come, you see us coming, get out of the way.
[02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:28.200]   On chance, serendipity can be calculated now.
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:30.520]   We can actually produce it electronically.
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:34.120]   What does that even mean?
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:36.680]   All right, let's do...
[02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:38.440]   Okay, those are the Schmittisms.
[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:39.960]   And let's just try.
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.480]   Give me one interview question.
[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:42.520]   Oh, okay, well...
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:44.440]   Banned from Google Interviews.
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:45.560]   Go ahead and pick your way through this.
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:46.520]   Oh, it's a slide show.
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:48.360]   Round Manhole Covers,
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:50.760]   because everybody knows why Manhole Covers are round,
[02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:52.200]   to look like the Nest thermostat.
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:54.360]   Piano tuners.
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:57.240]   How many piano tuners are there in the world?
[02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:00.120]   Well, the answer...
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:01.560]   Yeah.
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:05.800]   Read the answer however many the market dictates.
[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:07.720]   If pianos need tuning once a week,
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:09.640]   and it takes an hour to tune a piano,
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:12.840]   and a piano tuner works eight hours a day for five days a week,
[02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:14.840]   40 pianos need tuning each week,
[02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:17.160]   we'd answer one for every 40 pianos.
[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:20.200]   And then you're supposed to show that work,
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:22.440]   and then show maybe some calculations about
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:23.960]   roughly how many pianos there might be.
[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:26.760]   And it doesn't matter if you get the answer right on these.
[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:28.120]   That'd be...
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:29.400]   People don't do these anymore.
[02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:30.120]   Do they these...
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:31.560]   They don't do this anymore.
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:32.600]   I think it's deprecated.
[02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:33.400]   But these are the banned ones,
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:34.440]   that's the point.
[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:35.960]   But no, those are the bad ones.
[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:37.880]   Well, what's a good one, Kevin Marks?
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:40.520]   If you were going to hire me tomorrow for British Telecom,
[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:42.680]   what would you like to know?
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:47.960]   Well, the thing is that these brain teas of things
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:49.800]   were very popular that...
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:50.760]   Yes.
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:53.560]   But they don't actually tell you anything useful.
[02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:53.800]   Right.
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:54.920]   Because they just tell you whether you've seen
[02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:55.800]   that kind of question before.
[02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:57.080]   And it's not any of these assessment things.
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:58.360]   They're too well known now.
[02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:02.040]   You know, my son's teaching SAT prep this week,
[02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:04.280]   and he's helping students get their SAT scores
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:05.160]   up a lot.
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:06.840]   Which you're not supposed to do in theory,
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:07.960]   it's supposed to be an objective assessment.
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:10.040]   But actually, if you sit down and do...
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:11.080]   You know, you're 10-10.
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:11.640]   You know, you're testing a week,
[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:12.120]   you...
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:13.400]   And look at what you've got wrong,
[02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:15.240]   you can get better at this stuff.
[02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:16.120]   And it's not any of these things.
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:17.560]   Any of these things don't actually make sense.
[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:20.200]   There was a really good article on
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:21.000]   "Model View Culture",
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.360]   which I'll check, stick in the chat,
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:27.320]   about how we do engineering recruitment
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:30.040]   and how it ends up being a
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:31.400]   "Are you like me?" question,
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:32.760]   rather than a...
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:33.720]   Isn't that...
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:34.840]   Isn't that really the truth?
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:35.320]   Isn't it useful?
[02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:55.180]   It referred to Joel Spolsky's "G
[02:07:55.180 --> 02:08:01.900]   and the thing that I'm saying to them"
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:03.420]   And what it comes down to is,
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:06.140]   and the other thing he says,
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:07.580]   he said in the original piece was,
[02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:10.860]   "Pick something that they say that you know is true
[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:12.060]   and say, 'Well, that can't be true'
[02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:14.060]   and get them to defend it."
[02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:16.620]   So basically, troll them in the interview
[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:18.220]   to see how they respond to it.
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:19.100]   Which is...
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:19.820]   You know...
[02:08:19.820 --> 02:08:21.500]   When they troll your interviewees,
[02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:23.340]   let's just, you know, have a civil power.
[02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:24.860]   Let's switch them on to terrible power.
[02:08:24.860 --> 02:08:28.620]   You're selecting people who have in crappy chat rooms.
[02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:29.580]   So sorry, sorry, Gina.
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:30.940]   No, no, I was going to say,
[02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:31.500]   like you're just...
[02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:32.380]   It's such a...
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:34.700]   You know, let's put someone who's totally not in a...
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:35.740]   Right.
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:37.180]   Someone in a power system.
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:37.340]   It's a power trip.
[02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:38.540]   Someone who's disempowered.
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:39.260]   Totally empowered.
[02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:39.980]   And then how the person powers say,
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:40.860]   you're wrong.
[02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:40.940]   Yeah.
[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:42.380]   Then see how the disempowered person is.
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:42.780]   Yeah.
[02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:44.380]   And it's like ridiculous.
[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:45.740]   You know, I haven't done a developer
[02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:47.500]   and engineer interview in years and years
[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:49.260]   because I've been lucky enough to freelance
[02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:50.940]   and to start my own business and all that.
[02:08:50.940 --> 02:08:51.740]   But I just...
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:53.660]   I really want to be in one of these interviews
[02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:56.460]   where they ask, what was it in the internship?
[02:08:56.460 --> 02:08:57.820]   If you were shrunk down a half an inch
[02:08:57.820 --> 02:08:59.260]   and stuck in the bottom of the left or...
[02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:00.220]   How would you get out?
[02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:00.460]   Yeah.
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:02.060]   Because I would like to just look at the interview
[02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:02.860]   with my face and be like,
[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:04.860]   is this the question that you're deciding
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:05.660]   whether or not to hire?
[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:05.900]   Yeah.
[02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:07.580]   Because if this is the question,
[02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:09.180]   then this is not the right place for me to work.
[02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:10.940]   Like, and get up and walk out.
[02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:12.940]   Because it's true.
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:14.620]   It's just so indicative of stupidity.
[02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:16.300]   I mean, it's fun to look in this article now,
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:17.500]   what questions have been banned.
[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:20.700]   But it's so crazy that Google like fell into this trap.
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:21.740]   It's hard.
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:22.380]   You know what I mean?
[02:09:22.380 --> 02:09:24.620]   It's very hard to hire people.
[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:25.180]   Yeah.
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:26.220]   It is.
[02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:27.340]   It's extremely difficult.
[02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:28.460]   It's extremely difficult.
[02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:28.940]   Yeah.
[02:09:28.940 --> 02:09:29.260]   It's true.
[02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:31.020]   Getting people to actually write some code,
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:31.900]   it can be a good thing.
[02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:32.860]   Getting them to...
[02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:34.860]   That's not necessarily a bad idea.
[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:37.260]   Getting to do it on a whiteboard may not be the idea.
[02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:37.820]   Yeah.
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:37.900]   Yeah.
[02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:38.700]   There's...
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:40.780]   And Google itself is backed away from this.
[02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:41.500]   No.
[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:43.500]   When I was in the theme for Google,
[02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:45.180]   there was a bunch of banned questions.
[02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:46.780]   There was also a sort of pool of,
[02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:47.900]   these are fairly good questions,
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:49.180]   what do you think in any time of discussion
[02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:51.340]   or to try and make them better.
[02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:52.460]   But there was...
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:55.420]   It was still very hard to not get people to play Gotcha
[02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:56.220]   when they're interviewing.
[02:09:56.220 --> 02:10:00.220]   I've got to wrap this up because this is the party
[02:10:00.220 --> 02:10:01.740]   for the 30 anniversary of the Brick House.
[02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:01.740]   Oh.
[02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:03.180]   And there's a lot of people gathering.
[02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:06.300]   It was three years ago tomorrow,
[02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:07.420]   but we're not going to be here tomorrow.
[02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:09.660]   So three years ago tomorrow that we opened the Brick House
[02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:13.500]   for the first time, July 24th, 2011.
[02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:14.060]   I know.
[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:15.420]   It's that hard to believe.
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:16.860]   We had a big parade and everything.
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:18.220]   And so we've got...
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:19.100]   We've got pizza.
[02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:19.820]   Thank you.
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:22.380]   And we've got a pretty good audience.
[02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:23.580]   So thank you all for being here.
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:24.860]   We're going to celebrate just a bit.
[02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:26.380]   Coming up, Tech News Tonight.
[02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:28.940]   I've got to end though with David Poe's review
[02:10:28.940 --> 02:10:30.860]   of wearable watches.
[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:32.620]   I think this is the one...
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:33.660]   This is the depth...
[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:36.700]   Yale Online University, 80 20 52.
[02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:39.820]   Welcome back students.
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:40.940]   In this virtual class,
[02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:43.260]   we examine the desperately primitive early efforts
[02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:46.140]   of your ancient ancestors to develop technologies...
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:47.660]   What are they wearing a sleep mask?
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:51.100]   Learning about these crude devices is useful for content
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:52.700]   without knowing where we've been.
[02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:54.300]   How can we know where we're going?
[02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:56.380]   In previous virtual meetings,
[02:10:56.380 --> 02:10:58.380]   we've looked at the UNIVAC 1,
[02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:00.780]   for the earliest computers,
[02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:05.100]   the Apple II showing the computer shrinking to desktop size.
[02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:08.780]   And of course, the new representing the further shrinking...
[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:09.900]   All right, I can't bear this.
[02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:10.940]   So thank you very much.
[02:11:10.940 --> 02:11:11.420]   It's just...
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:11.980]   It will...
[02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:14.540]   You believe this is an exercise for the viewer.
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:16.300]   Thank you very much everybody.
[02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:17.500]   Kevin Marks.
[02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:18.620]   Really appreciate it.
[02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:20.300]   Anything you want to plug, Kevin, before we go?
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:26.220]   Just the usual indiewebcamp.com,
[02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:29.020]   you set up your own website.
[02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:31.740]   Community people to help you do that.
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:33.660]   I really want to do this thing.
[02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:35.180]   No thing, yeah.
[02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:35.420]   No.
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:37.260]   Well, I'll get...
[02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:39.100]   He emailed me and I'm just waiting.
[02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:43.260]   I guess they want to get it off of whatever weird database they were.
[02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:44.780]   They're getting to the point where they can...
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:46.380]   They can do hosted staff.
[02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:49.260]   But he's based that side of the bridge as well.
[02:11:49.260 --> 02:11:51.260]   So you should just get Ben to drop it to buy some time.
[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:51.660]   I will.
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:52.060]   That'll be fun.
[02:11:52.060 --> 02:11:53.020]   We'll talk to Ben.
[02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:53.580]   Thank you, Kevin.
[02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:54.220]   Appreciate it.
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:57.100]   Jeff Jarvis at the City University of New York.
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:11:59.420]   He blogs at Buzz Machine, author of Public Parts.
[02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:00.540]   Great to see you once again.
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:01.980]   Always my friend.
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:03.020]   You're not so pink today.
[02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:03.900]   You look good.
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:05.900]   Gina Trapani, before the candles burn down.
[02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:09.180]   I'm having a dear life hacker.
[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:11.340]   You'll find her now at ThinkUp.com.
[02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:12.860]   Get your ThinkUp.
[02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:13.820]   It's so awesome.
[02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:15.260]   Thank you everybody.

[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:21.340]   Two weeks.

[02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:24.220]   Just sign in.
[02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:26.460]   We started this show three or four days ago.
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:28.940]   But we're going to wrap it up now.
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:30.700]   We do it normally 1 p.m.
[02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:33.820]   Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesdays.
[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:37.740]   Thank you for joining us and we will see you next time.
[02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:40.300]   On this week in Google.
[02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:42.860]   Look at that cake.
[02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:45.980]   Thank you everybody.
[02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:54.940]   Happy third anniversary brick house.
