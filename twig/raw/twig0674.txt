[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. I'm back and is here and to prove it.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.120]   Jeff Jarvis, Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.840]   So are Alphabet's earnings kind of a bad news, bad news thing,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.040]   but it sure helped Alphabet in the stock market up to 8% at the time of recording.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.200]   Instagram is terrible. It's not just us that agrees.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.560]   So does the head of Instagram.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.800]   Plus, Mark Zuckerberg says it's time to turn up the heat for employees at Facebook.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.400]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.880]   [Music]

[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.640]   Hands-on photography. Hello, Ant. Good to see you.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.720]   Hello, Mr. LaPorte. You too, sir. Good to see you back.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.080]   Yeah. Well, as you might notice, I am actually not in the big room,
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.840]   sitting in the big chair.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.680]   I am doing this in quarantine from my office because
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.880]   Madam Rona paid a visit during the cruise.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.280]   On your cruise ship? Yeah.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.440]   No.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.600]   He got me some of those.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.920]   That's Stacey Higginbotham. Stacey on IoT, the IoT podcast.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.680]   Hello, Stacey.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.200]   Lovely to see you. Hello, all.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.160]   And joining us from the Leonard Tao Professor of journalistic expertise
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.840]   from the Craig Newmark Graduate School of
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.640]   Journalism at the Center City University of New York in the
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   director of the 10 I said.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.920]   Miles away from the blood and catch up to her from golf at Ben
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.920]   Minster.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.320]   MBS is a splinter golf club, right?
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320]   Yep.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.120]   This is his response to the PGA. Golf is so boring.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.520]   Nobody's chopped up with chainsaw.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.920]   I'm starting to ask you to ask your question.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   All right.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.160]   Take down the lower third now.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160]   All right.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.400]   So I am in sequestration in my office because I didn't, I was
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.800]   wearing an N95 mask, but clearly I should have been wearing this
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.720]   big giant respirator instead, which I'm wearing now.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.960]   I am your father.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.120]   The good news is because I'm vaxxed and boosted twice, even
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.680]   though I'm pretty sure it was BA5, it was like a cold.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   It wasn't bad.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.480]   But on the other hand, it's lingering.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.560]   She might have long COVID.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.720]   It's not, she's not doing well.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.600]   So it's not worth the risk.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.840]   I got to tell you.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.120]   I get so good news for Lisa if she wants it.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.200]   I got hit pretty hard by what I think was a BA5 or four variant.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.720]   And I was having like super long COVID symptoms.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.400]   Like I was only good for like three or four hours a day, but
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.680]   about eight weeks afterwards, I'd back to normal.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.080]   Eight weeks, you think that's good news?
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   Wow.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.720]   Well, it's not like six months.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.120]   No, it's only like two months.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.560]   No.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.400]   Like how you eat early and--
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.960]   Yeah, she said brain fog.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.640]   She's had a high fever.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.520]   We both got pretty congested cold likes and sore throat and
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.160]   congestion, but I recovered a little faster.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.760]   I think, knock on wood, you know, I could, I think it's
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.520]   cyclical, right?
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.840]   You can go read through late relapse.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.080]   You can, yeah.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.400]   Anyway, I did test on before I came in yesterday and was still
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.080]   had some virus in the blood stream, but I will test again
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.760]   a couple of days.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.280]   Maybe I'll be all right.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.320]   Anyway, I'll jump jump items over it now.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.480]   I want whatever the president got.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.800]   Actually, you know who holds the record, at least by his
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.400]   recount, Alex Lindsey of Macbreak Weekly, he got it.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.320]   He said, yeah, I had it for three hours.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.160]   Three hours.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.320]   The man's resilient.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.880]   Three-ish.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.320]   I thought you were going to say--
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   That's what he said.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   Yeah, the Vorac will never get it.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.080]   Anyway, I'm mad at you guys.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.840]   Thanks to Jason Howell for filling in because everybody
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.200]   comes up to me on the boat saying, oh, Twig was great this
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.560]   week.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.880]   It was so funny.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.960]   You guys, oh, they were so good.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.760]   And I'm going, oh, I get it.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.920]   I feel like Wally Pip here.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.920]   Who's Wally Pip?
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.200]   No, you're not Wally Pip.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.160]   No, no, you're not Wally Pip.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.800]   That's a reference.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.600]   I don't get that.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.600]   You don't get that?
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   There must be sports.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.240]   I bet it's sports.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.080]   It's baseball.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   Yeah, Wally Pip.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.160]   Yeah, there's no Zilio no Zilio.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.480]   Wally Pip was the first baseman for the New York Yankees.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.280]   Got beamed by a ball, got a migraine.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.040]   Headache told the coach, I'm going to take the day off.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.120]   Coach said, all right, we got this young rookie.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.360]   We'll put him in first base.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.240]   His name was Lou Gehrig.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.840]   He stayed at first base for the longest streak.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.240]   And over 3,000 games.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.120]   And no one ever heard of Wally Pip again.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.360]   Who was the fifth beatle?
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.320]   I feel like the fifth beatle.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.280]   Anyway, thank you in all sincerity for doing a great show.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.360]   And thank you, Jason.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.960]   And I guess you guys had a wonderful time.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.920]   So a big story today is a Google story.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.120]   Alphabet earnings are out.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.600]   And we were talking earlier on Windows Weekly
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.760]   about Microsoft's earnings.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.120]   And Microsoft's ad sales were down big time.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.920]   And all the companies, Microsoft, Apple,
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.560]   saying, oh, head wins from COVID, from the global recession,
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.560]   from a supply chain shortage, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.120]   Google probably less hit by a supply chain shortage
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.360]   than anybody, although they still have network servers
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.400]   and so forth.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.040]   But--
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.600]   Yeah, they still got to build their own gear.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.120]   And in the call yesterday, this is from Reuters,
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.360]   a trio of Alphabet executives, sounded caution
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.240]   on a call with investment analysts using the word
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   uncertain or uncertainty 13 times to describe the economy.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.200]   YouTube ad sales grew at their slowest pace
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   since disclosures began in 2018, but did grow.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.080]   Alphabet shares, like Microsoft shares,
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.320]   went up more than 5% after the result.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.480]   7% I just looked at.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.440]   Wow.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.640]   The market loved it.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.600]   And the good news, according to Google,
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.680]   was a share of ad sales for in search, went up.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.040]   14% in search ad sales during the second quarter,
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.600]   beating the street 40 plus billion dollar revenue
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.200]   in search ad sales.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.240]   And one of the reasons Google says it was good
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.040]   is because people are traveling again,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.080]   and they're shopping again.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.160]   And so travel and retail advertisers powered that.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.000]   Which makes sense.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.200]   So it's not 40 billion, but Google Cloud revenue was also up.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.440]   It was up 36% here before.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.840]   To 6.3 billion.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.400]   So that's--
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.240]   Gotta put that in perspective.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.240]   --and cloud is a little--
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.520]   Yeah, I'm saying it's only 6.3 of the overall--
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.440]   how many billion did they report?
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.200]   Well, of course, Mary and Joe finally immediately said,
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.640]   well, compare that to Microsoft Azure, which
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.200]   is over 20--
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.680]   So Azure.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.440]   --so I feel like--
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.080]   Right?
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.400]   Azure's like over 25 billion.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.520]   Azure actually-- their server and cloud revenue increased 26%.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   So Google growing more.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.200]   So Google's coming up from a way-- well,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.600]   but it's a way smaller number.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.120]   Right.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.280]   Azure is number two in the cloud wars.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.040]   And Google's like a--
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.840]   just a third.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:20.040]   So shares are now up 8.18% on Google stock.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.600]   Jesus, has I checked two minutes ago?
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.120]   So the market likes it.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.920]   Even though second quarter profit fell,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.800]   aw, they only made $16 billion.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.400]   Aw, in three months.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.120]   Thank you, Janet.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.240]   Aw, that's barely $5 billion a month.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.760]   Aw, that's barely a billion in a quarter a week.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.440]   Aw.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.520]   Nevertheless, the market says, well,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.800]   we think their Google might have a future.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.440]   I'm sorry she's the alphabet.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.240]   I don't think that--
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.760]   I think what's happening with all the tech companies
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.560]   is they're using this as an excuse to lay off.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.280]   That's exactly right.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.360]   Everybody, Spotify just said they're going to lay off 10%.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.520]   And they killed Car Thingy, which never
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.440]   made sense in the first place, and took a $30 billion
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.560]   right down on it.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.280]   Sure.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.640]   Car Thingy was what?
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.360]   Stacey, what was Car Thingy?
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.080]   It was a piece of hardware, a dedicated hardware,
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.560]   for Spotify that you put on your vent in your car
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.440]   and you plug it in--
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.440]   It's like the thing Amazon did, right?
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   Yeah, it was about as--
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.320]   Do you know Amazon do something similar to that?
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.560]   Yeah, they had an Echo Auto.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.520]   I still have one.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.000]   The Echo Auto was a terrible piece.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.560]   Terrible.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.120]   Car Thingy was actually good.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.800]   Terrible.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.560]   But really weird.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.920]   Why?
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.320]   We still don't know.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.080]   Spotify says they learned a lot from--
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.800]   They learned a lot.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.440]   But it's interesting.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.280]   It still took a $30 million right now.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.160]   Spotify, Snap, some of the smaller companies
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.720]   really suffering on the market with the economic woes.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.920]   Microsoft, Google.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.680]   We'll see Apple's coming out tomorrow.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.840]   Amazon tomorrow, I think.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.840]   Amazon tomorrow.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.720]   This is the big week for quarterly earnings.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.440]   The Guardian says Google's earnings signal company
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.080]   weathering slowdown better than expected.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.000]   So that's apparently what the street is saying.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.920]   Hey, it could have been worse.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.920]   Let's celebrate.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.840]   I don't know all of this macro, micro, financial stuff.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.200]   But when they said that they're talking about uncertainty
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.040]   13 times or something like that, is that a way of sort
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.360]   of hedging their bets for the analysts?
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.760]   Well, there's two things that happen.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.320]   And you probably Stacy could explain this better than me.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.320]   There's two things that happen in these quarterly results
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.680]   and these analysts calls.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.440]   But first of all, they're going to tell you how they did so far.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.280]   But then really, the market reacts more to--
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.640]   they then predict what their next quarter is going to be like.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.640]   Right, Stacy?
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.960]   So the market's saying, well, OK, yeah, you didn't do as badly
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.320]   this quarter and next quarter maybe things are going to look up.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.800]   But they're also sandbagging.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   Well, we talked about that.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.000]   Well, that's a test.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.500]   Right.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.320]   You can't sandbag too much.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.160]   No.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   Is that OK?
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   Yes.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.640]   A pair of Apple-- OK.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.720]   I love the hear what you think, Stacey.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.200]   We talked about it on Tuesday on Macbreak Weekly, which is Apple
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.320]   for a long time did sandbag, I mean, clearly.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.000]   Analysts would always come in low.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.520]   Apple would outperform and the stock would go up.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.800]   It is supposed, although there's no concrete evidence that the SEC
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.920]   at some point came knocking on Tim Cooks
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.440]   and look at Maestry there, CFO's door and said, ah, you can't be
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.920]   doing that anymore.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.680]   Because the SEC-- it is-- the SEC wants you to be--
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.280]   It is illegal to lie.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:33.800]   Yes.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.360]   Yes.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.440]   And that is true.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.320]   But you can infer things and you can lead people to think things
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.000]   that would maybe lead them to different conclusions.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.400]   OK.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.240]   And of course, the SEC seems to be a toothless tiger these days.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.920]   There's this thing called non-gap reporting, generally
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.560]   accepted accounting practices.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.720]   You would think would be generally accepted.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.360]   But a lot of companies now do non-gap performance.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.200]   You still have to report for your SEC and your 10Ks and 8Ks
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:14.560]   and stuff.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.440]   You still have to use gap accounting for that.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.760]   But that's your-- in your financial statements,
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.160]   you still--
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.320]   Interesting.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.400]   But the headlines often report non-gap.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.200]   That's reporters being silly.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.960]   That's because reporters don't know their even
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.920]   up from their net profits from--
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.640]   You don't know, you're even up from a hole in the ground.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.080]   I was going to go to a very profane level.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.720]   Well, it would have been a good title.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.080]   I wish you had.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.080]   Nope.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.600]   Nope.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.640]   Nope.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.760]   They don't know their even up from Shinola.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.680]   Jeff will get that one.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.720]   Jeff, are you only up to remember Shinola?
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.320]   And what it was distinct from.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.360]   I'm going to stop trying so hard.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.680]   I feel really the pressure of last week's show over my head
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.880]   here.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.880]   Humors.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.040]   Here, you're just sick.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.880]   Just rest and let us--
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:10.880]   Just--
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.680]   I'll let you carry on.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.600]   Don't pressure yourself.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.120]   Also, somebody in the chat were saying,
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.640]   I look like I'm at the little kids table
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.760]   because I have too much headroom, which is--
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.840]   Matt's headroom, room shot.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.800]   I'm going to fix my headroom.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.880]   Facebook will have results soon.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.040]   Mark Zuckerberg-- and I love this.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.720]   The Verge got a recording of Mr. Zuckerberg's All Hands
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.600]   Meeting.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.560]   And this is a little editorializing going on here.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.440]   But I'm going to read it anyway because it's so well done.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.040]   What's it, Niele?
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.640]   He's good at that, isn't he?
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.240]   No, Alex Heath and David Pierce, right?
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.360]   OK, they are still good.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:51.920]   They're still good.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.960]   Like my favorite.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.800]   Yeah, I love Niele.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.680]   Mark Zuckerberg stared into his webcam,
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.840]   trying to make yet another remote meeting seem urgent.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.600]   Since Facebook started, he'd made a habit of frankly addressing
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.720]   employees directly at a weekly Q&A.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.800]   Almost no topic was off limits.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.640]   But as the company grew, these sessions had become more scripted.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.400]   He stopped showing up every week, letting other executives
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.960]   feel the most upvoted questions submitted by employees.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.160]   But June 30, the raw Zuckerberg persona was back.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.760]   Well, that's almost a month ago.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.960]   I guess they only just got the recording.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.560]   Sometimes he sounded like a general preparing
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.640]   his troops for the war ahead.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.760]   Other times he was the Wunderkid visionary,
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.240]   but mostly he just seemed annoyed.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.040]   The first question.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.080]   Hi, I'm Gary.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.360]   I'm located in Chicago.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.040]   Will Metadays extra days off introduced during the pandemic?
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.240]   Will they continue in 2023?
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.440]   Zuckerberg appeared visibly frustrated.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.480]   That's a lot for a robot to appear visibly frustrated.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.080]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.720]   This is also a terrible intro question.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.720]   Oh my god.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.280]   That's the worst one.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.800]   And by the way, in case you weren't--
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.360]   You have to work so much.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.320]   They're not going to-- he says, um, all right.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.280]   He just explained-- he thought the economy was heading
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.640]   for one of the worst downturns we've seen in recent history.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.520]   That's the quote.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.480]   He was already freezing, hiring in many areas.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.840]   TikToks eating their lunch.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.040]   It would take over a year and a half, Zuckerberg,
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.160]   had said before they had line of sight to overtaking TikTok.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.800]   And Gary was asking about extra vacation days?
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.160]   Given Zuckerberg--
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.200]   I'd be upset too.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.440]   Yeah, Zuckerberg said--
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.200]   Come on, people.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.520]   Given my tone and the rest of the Q&A,
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.480]   you can probably imagine what my reaction is, Zuckerberg said.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.640]   After this, Metadays were canceled.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:56.480]   Yeah, everybody is saying to the troops, saying to the market,
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.640]   saying to the press, it's going to be a tough time ahead.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.200]   Yeah?
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.720]   Metadays seems to always react poorly.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.680]   That's because, Met, they are robots.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.320]   They don't mean people in terms of--
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.320]   Yeah, they are.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:10.820]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.240]   The latest kerfuffle-- I don't know.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.680]   Did you talk about this last week?
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.560]   The Kardashians?
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.280]   No, we didn't.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.000]   Kylie Jenner?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.800]   I don't think--
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.300]   Go ahead.
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:18.840]   Did they start?
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.680]   Did they post a call?
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.960]   No, it was after last week.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.680]   Otherwise, we would have been on the news,
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.720]   because we're always on the news.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.960]   It happened afterwards.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.320]   The Kardashians, including Kylie Jenner,
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.440]   hate the new Instagram.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.080]   Kim and Kylie, make Instagram Instagram again.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.840]   Stop trying to be TikTok.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.160]   I just want to see cute photos of my friends
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.720]   signed sincerely everyone.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.360]   Yes.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.600]   1.1 million likes on this one.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.800]   Yeah, y'all can make fun of this.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.560]   The photographer is agreeing with them.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.560]   I am too.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.200]   It's awful.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.400]   We can't all have the same social--
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.920]   I used Twitter for one thing.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.040]   I used Instagram for another.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.240]   You can't have everything.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.960]   And though their opinion matters partially,
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.600]   because they have a huge follower network--
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.200]   Kylie Jenner has 360 million followers.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.720]   Yeah, wow.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.280]   She is important.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.160]   Wow.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.440]   And then also, are they--
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.360]   I get it.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.960]   They've got a TV show.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.280]   They've got their Hulu show.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.960]   Yes, it's back, baby.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.160]   Just when you thought I was saying.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.680]   I'm having to make--
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.280]   not everybody's into videos.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.640]   And there's lots of Instagram creators who are like, ugh,
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.400]   video.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.040]   It's so different.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.760]   And it seems unfair to pull the rug out
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.800]   from under people all the time.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.960]   Plus, Facebook has done how many pivots to video in the past?
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.640]   Yeah, I was about to say.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.000]   Plus, how many pivots to video do we need?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.160]   So the problem is Instagram started as photography.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.600]   It built this reputation off of photographers
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.400]   putting content out there that people enjoyed.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.560]   Yes, there were regular quote-unquote regular people
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.400]   posting things.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.320]   But the professional photographers
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.560]   went out there and really made the captivating
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.240]   and tried to build community off of it.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.800]   And now you're telling those photographers
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.920]   to kick rocks, basically.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.960]   Because you're just a white, bitter lensman.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.720]   So get ready.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.880]   How about you stop that, white, bitter lensman?
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.520]   Photography was--
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.040]   I don't think photographers were a big part of Instagram.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.280]   I thought Instagram was just a fun social network
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.920]   where you saw pictures of their friends doing something.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.280]   Well, people who liked pictures liked it.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.920]   People didn't like pictures.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.240]   Yeah, I liked it because I would post my pictures.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.960]   In fact, I remember in the early days of Instagram
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.400]   being offended when people would do pictures not
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.560]   from their camera phone but from their DSLR,
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.400]   you know, their fancy cameras.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.760]   But that became the thing.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.200]   You would post your best pictures.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.840]   I know you do, Anne.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.920]   So do I.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.160]   Now it's all videos, right?
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.720]   But we're get ready because Instagram CEO Adam Moseri
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.000]   responded to Kylie and Kim.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.200]   Where did he respond?
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.880]   You'd think Instagram maybe?
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.840]   No.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.240]   Twitter.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.440]   Here's his video.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.960]   Adam Moseri, who is-- importantly, by the way,
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.200]   not Kevin's sister, I'm one of the founders of Instagram.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.800]   But a meta guy brought in when the founders left in a huff.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.520]   His former head of newsfeed, very eye-up in Facebook,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.960]   and now he's the boss.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.760]   And here he is.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.600]   And he's responding.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.840]   It's experimenting with him.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.760]   By the way, he's a liar.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.160]   Adam, get a microphone.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.760]   Adam, get a microphone.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.840]   What do you-- Adam, first you're posting on Twitter,
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.680]   and now get a microphone.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.800]   There's a lot going on in Instagram right now.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.040]   We're experimenting with a number of different changes
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.720]   to the app.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.160]   And so we're hearing a lot of concerns from all of you.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.120]   So one is if you moments and clarify a few things.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.480]   One is if you're seeing a new full-screen version of a feed
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.600]   or you're hearing about it, know that that is a test.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.320]   It's a test to a few percentage of people out there.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.120]   And the idea is that a more full screen experience, not only
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.160]   for videos but for photos, might be a more fun, engaging
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.960]   experience.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.120]   But I also want to be clear.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.640]   It's not yet good.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.560]   What?
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.640]   It's not yet good.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.560]   And we're going to have to get it to a good place
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.720]   if we're going to ship it to the rest of the incident.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.360]   Everybody's seeing it, Adam.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.040]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.720]   I don't see it.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.480]   Small percentage, boy.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.080]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.440]   Let me go to my Instagram feed, because these days,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.760]   you think I'm seeing something different from what
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.960]   you're seeing?
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.440]   I don't see anything on Instagram,
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.120]   because I'm locked out of my Facebook account,
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.960]   and I don't care to get it back.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.160]   Oh, nice.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.360]   Nice, nice.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.120]   I see basically reels all the time.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:46.600]   Right?
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.360]   That's what I see.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.560]   Some videos, but I see more photos than video.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.400]   Oh, so maybe there is?
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.200]   OK, so maybe there is a difference.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.960]   You know, more videos that I use too, by all means, yes.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.240]   So this is funny, because I'm on the web, and you're right.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.520]   It's all stills.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.560]   As soon as I go to my phone, boom.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.000]   Oh, OK.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.320]   It's all videos.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:07.800]   That's right.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.160]   It's all stuff like this.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:16.040]   TikTok video, vertical video with captions and TikTok-y things.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.440]   And this looks just like something.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.520]   The first thing I see on my-- can you see this?
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.160]   Here's the first thing I see on my Instagram feed.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.360]   Me and Lisa's checking your tongue out.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.360]   Oh, see, that's great.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.160]   That's someone you actually follow that's showing up.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.400]   And here's Adam's--
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.680]   That's how I should be.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.560]   Adam is on Instagram too.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.400]   Oh, he is.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.640]   Next thing I see is his video.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.760]   Oh, all right.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.440]   There he is.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.520]   And he's close.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.400]   By the way, using the Zayfrank editing style,
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.560]   you said it was edited a lot.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.320]   I think that's intentional.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.320]   That comes from 20 years ago when a guy named Zayfrank, who
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.800]   is a wonderful fellow, figured out
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.680]   that if he edited out all the blinking,
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.520]   his videos would be very compelling.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.280]   But whatever happened to Zay--
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.680]   Zay ended up going to work for a food channel.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.240]   He invented--
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:07.920]   I can't do it.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.840]   You got to edit this out.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.080]   You can't do it.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.760]   He invented the top-down food thing.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.640]   It's not taste made.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.400]   I can't remember who he's doing in videos for.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.200]   But he invented the modern way of showing food.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:23.600]   On--
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.680]   What?
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.640]   Yeah, on--
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.400]   You know, like Insta and Facebook and all that.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:27.920]   You know, the top-down--
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.520]   Same thing with things.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.040]   Where they-- it's fast and they do
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.040]   recipe in the swirl and stuff.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:33.720]   Yeah, Zayfrank--
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.600]   Oh, OK.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.600]   Did you know what I'm talking about?
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.360]   Didn't know that.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:37.800]   I know who he--
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.720]   He also worked for BuzzFeed for some time.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.480]   Yeah, it was the BuzzFeed food thing, whatever that is.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.600]   Oh, they created a platform called Tasty.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.200]   Tasty, that's it.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:48.920]   Oh, so he did Tasty.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.680]   That's BuzzFeed's.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.040]   That's BuzzFeed's.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:50.600]   He invented--
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.440]   --the Tasty style.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.920]   All right, I'm going to show you a Tasty--
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.600]   Let me see if I can-- no, I don't know.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.440]   I'm not going to show it to you.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.440]   No.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.680]   I don't know why I'm getting--
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.800]   What is in your search?
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.280]   You're in your search too.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.320]   He left in 2019.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.920]   Oh, now he's doing Disney Junior, I guess.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.680]   No, that's 2008.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.840]   What is Zayfrank doing?
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.680]   That's what I asked.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.120]   You have to answer.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.280]   Well, you're on Wikipedia.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.200]   Welcome to our stream of consciousness,
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.480]   where we talk about Google and whatever else
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.560]   floats across our minds.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.200]   So what else did the Missouri say?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.280]   I stopped the video.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.960]   I was so bored.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.880]   And then his last on Zayfrank.com, his last thing
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.760]   was 2012.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.520]   What?
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.440]   OK, so they're testing this out.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.280]   Don't get mad at them, Kim.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.360]   Lay off.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.400]   Chill, Kylie.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.800]   We're just trying.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.040]   You can still put photos of your lip plumper working.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.120]   It'll be great.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:49.600]   And--
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.320]   All right.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.840]   And we know it's not good.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.120]   I mean, we know that.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:53.640]   So--
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.160]   You know.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.880]   Help me to replace the stop.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.800]   And I loved--
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.080]   But that's very googly of them to just the route stuff
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.560]   that's already pretty craptastic for the public
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.320]   to play with.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.040]   Why not test it internally?
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.720]   And I think they're testing it more widely
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.040]   than they're admitting.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.560]   Right.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.800]   And was it Vice who said, and the new Instagram
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.640]   will continue until morale improves?
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.280]   Anyway.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.320]   Anyway.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.480]   But Leo, you should be happy because Mark Zuckerberg
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.040]   on Facebook announced that you're finally
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.000]   going to get the Facebook you want too late.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.560]   But you're getting--
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560]   Oh, really?
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.560]   What?
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.280]   What?
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.600]   They're doing the chrono.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.640]   They're going to do reels there.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.360]   Oh, good.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.800]   And that's going to be the main news feed.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.680]   But then you can go and do your chrono
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.200]   of just the people you know.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.640]   Incidentally, another thing that Zuckerberg said
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.320]   at this meeting transcribed by The Verge,
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.400]   there are a lot of people at the company who shouldn't be here.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.000]   And I think the employees went, what?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.680]   What?
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.560]   Wait, what?
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.160]   That's the old look to the right and look to the left.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.160]   One of you will be here and time to turn the fat.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.600]   Is that what he's saying?
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:11.960]   I remember when I matriculated at a fine East Coast University,
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.360]   they did say that one in three of you is going to flunk out.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.040]   A little did I know I was the one.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.520]   So I was good.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.160]   White the cautionary tale you are.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.400]   You see, you could end up as this.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.400]   Don't kids be cool.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.080]   Stay in school.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   So what they're going to do chronological as the default?
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.720]   Yeah, that's down under.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.880]   I put that under Quick Takes.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.440]   That's the line 47.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.280]   OK.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.400]   I don't buy it, sir.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.440]   What don't you buy?
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.400]   If this is the same company that's running Instagram,
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.720]   that pretty much said the same thing, I don't buy it.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.400]   Insta-lose is going to give you chronological--
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.640]   So you are no longer defending followers.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.360]   You're no longer defending Instagram.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.680]   You're kind of finally got to the point where--
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.720]   I still go over there because I have a community there.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.240]   But what I'm noticing is a dip in my community engagement.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.080]   And at first, I thought it was just me, but it's not just me.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.040]   And so I started to dig into it a little bit more,
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.760]   looking at my analytics and whatnot.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.760]   And I noticed that they're not even serving my content up.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.120]   Hold on.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.600]   I can show you here.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.240]   Cut to my screen on my phone.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:28.840]   I can show you--
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.160]   What is that?
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.080]   A necktie bottle opener?
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.360]   Yeah, you don't have a bottle opener?
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.480]   That's very dressy.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.480]   That's very dressy.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.920]   I like it.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.200]   I thought everybody had one on their desk.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.440]   Let me see if I can make it focus here.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.520]   But there's-- like this image here,
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.000]   I have like 3,000 followers or whatever.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.320]   How come it's only reaching 1,000 accounts
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.960]   and only reaching 800 of my followers?
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.360]   Yeah, that's very frustrating.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.440]   That's stupid.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.920]   You know, I had--
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.360]   I put a post up on the stories just to test it out yesterday
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.920]   or maybe it's a day before.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.880]   And it's just a random phrase that I know only a few people
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.960]   would get.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.240]   And one person answered it.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.720]   And they literally said in the message,
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.440]   we thought you were off of Instagram.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.720]   Just like that.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.920]   Why is that?
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.720]   If you actively follow someone on any of these platforms,
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.840]   shouldn't it be prioritized that the people you follow
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.240]   are the first thing you see in your feed?
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.280]   Well, they know you're complaining about the plant
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.920]   and they're getting back at you.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.000]   You've got to behave.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.920]   You've got to behave.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.200]   It pisses me off.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.880]   I'm totally fine with algorithms helping me to discover
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.920]   other things.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:51.120]   But not that the mercy of me losing out on people
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.840]   that I actively want to see.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.240]   You're post on Twitter here.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.080]   This really bugs me.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.440]   If someone follows an account, that followed account
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.640]   should be prioritized in their view.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.840]   And I think that's completely reasonable.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.080]   You're right.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.400]   Salt Hank has almost a million followers on Instagram.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.240]   But by the way--
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.400]   Isn't that is not?
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.240]   Whether it's photo or video, because I'm
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.960]   noticing it on my reels as well.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.120]   My reels are doing fairly well from the view
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.600]   standpoint.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.760]   But my people that follow me, they're not seeing my reels.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.280]   This is a bunch of other weird accounts and bots
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.640]   and things that pop it in there.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.120]   And honestly, I think this is clearly
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.080]   the TikTokification of Instagram.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.520]   I mean, that's what TikTok is, right?
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:35.960]   You don't get to be followed.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.760]   It's more than that.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.840]   Even when you go to the following tab.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.320]   And you're sounding like me.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.040]   Oh, you're doing angry at all.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.840]   Jeff, you need a moral panic sign.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.600]   Yeah, I need an ant panic.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.280]   I think it's more than just TikTokification.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.840]   I think it's also that Facebook has never had a raise on debt.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.160]   It never really knew why--
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.640]   Oh, we have a whole bunch of people.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.560]   What are they going to do?
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.200]   Well, they're going to date each other.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.960]   Then they're going to have a news feed.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.840]   And then they're going to have videos.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   And then they're going to live in--
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.960]   we're worlds.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.080]   And then we're going to have videos again.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.840]   And they never kind of said, this is why Facebook exists.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.240]   Instagram too.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.760]   And they don't have that soul to guide them where they go.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.480]   So the same problem with things like the oversight board
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.440]   and all that.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.160]   Why are you here?
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.080]   What do you want to do?
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.480]   Do that well instead of copying and buying things.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.120]   It's frustrating.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.520]   So I'm going to now point you to the article
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.920]   that I'm sure you put in there from Axios by Scott Rosen.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.520]   Yes, I did.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.440]   Now tell us, first of all, who Scott Rosenberg is.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.000]   Because this guy--
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.760]   Scott Rosenberg wrote a--
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.400]   he's been around a good long while.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.160]   He wrote a book about blogging.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.920]   He knows what he's doing.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   He knows what he's doing.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.920]   Mm-hmm.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.960]   Is he-- was he-- did he start at the examiner, I want to say?
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.280]   And then his history is quite interesting.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:03.720]   But he certainly--
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.240]   Yeah, was he--
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.600]   Um, oh, there's too many.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.760]   Scott Rosenberg's.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.200]   I feel like he was one of the founders of Slate.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:12.920]   Was he Slate?
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.440]   I think he was--
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:14.760]   I think he was.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.800]   So this guy's been around as long as--
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.300]   He knows.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:17.800]   He knows.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.120]   --as long as you and I have been.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.000]   He says, it's the end of the social network.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.120]   Mark last week, he writes, as the end
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.760]   of the social networking era, which
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.080]   began with the rise of Friendster in 2003--
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.480]   app, that's accurate.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.560]   Remember how quickly Friendster took over,
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.560]   shaped two decades of internet growth,
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.040]   and now closes with Facebook's rollout
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.960]   of a sweeping TikTok-like redesign.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:51.320]   Basically, maybe it has also to do with Elon Musk
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.200]   and the Twitter debacle.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.800]   Oh, really?
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.040]   Well, he says the era in which social networking
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.120]   served as most users' primary experience of the internet
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.920]   is moving behind us.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.120]   That holds for Twitter, Facebook's chief surviving
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.840]   Western rifle as well.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.440]   Do you think this would be the rise of the group chat?
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.200]   People have their own--
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:15.760]   No, I think--
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.120]   --timey circle of friends.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.840]   I think you're right, Ant.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.440]   Go ahead.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.120]   Jeff doesn't.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.880]   So go ahead, Jeff.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.360]   And I think the other thing I'm here,
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.240]   and I'm curious to hear what you're
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.040]   thinking about this, because you are one,
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.600]   is what they keep on talking about
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.800]   is how is the time for creators?
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.160]   So it's not social.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.600]   It's moved to creators.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.600]   That's a story.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.880]   That's the irony is you're a creator and you're angry.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   That's the--
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   --productions for the--
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.880]   --and they're angry.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.360]   That's the fork in the road, because that's
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:47.880]   what's happening is Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube,
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.080]   favoring creators.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.520]   That's going to continue.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.480]   But I think, Ant's right--
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.320]   Yeah, that's the money maker.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.640]   That's going to continue.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.120]   But that's not one-to-one communication.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.840]   That's one to many communications.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   That's brilliant.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   Right.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   Right.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.840]   That's the oldest school.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.840]   Which is what Scott's saying.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   That's disappearing.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   In a way, is this right?
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.840]   Well, but I think Ant's right.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.840]   It's not going away.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.560]   It's going underground, because when you go on Discord,
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.000]   for instance, and I think our Discord for the club
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.120]   is a perfect example, that's a social network.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.120]   Clearly.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.120]   But it's not--
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   I agree.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.120]   --you don't know about.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.120]   Yep.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.120]   Yep.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.120]   Well, and I think part of it is we all
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.320]   realize that when you turn social content--
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.240]   like social--
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.040]   I'm trying to create a different word for this.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.040]   But your message is to your friend and family,
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.120]   and you turn those into content.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.280]   Like, when you're talking about your day towards your friends,
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.240]   or just towards the general public, you're not thinking of yourself as a content curator.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.240]   Right.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   Incidentally, right?
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.240]   Or a content creator, rather.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.240]   Right.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.480]   And I think people just got sick of that, unless they're people--
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:53.160]   this is why journalists love Twitter, is because we're content creators, but we're not the
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.440]   kind of content creators that's creating these highly crafted videos and that sort
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.440]   of thing.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.920]   We're just like sharing our opinions.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:05.920]   So the people who like sharing their opinions have taken over social networks because--
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.920]   Influencers.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.920]   --they're not social.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.920]   Well, it's not even that.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.160]   It gets you back to Dunbar's number and everything.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.160]   Right.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   You can't be social to everyone.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.160]   Right.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.160]   And this just took us time.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.400]   You're now broadcasting.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.480]   So I think there's another piece here, which is this creation piece, pardon me for my Jeff
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   history moment.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.440]   I won't call the way back to Gutenberg.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:29.440]   I'll go to 1600 and montane, the first essayist.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.440]   Excuse me.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.080]   And what-- you've read them too.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.080]   You went to Yale.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.080]   So it was a montane.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.280]   I was going to say we got a Yale and montane.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:45.640]   I would like to point out I flunked out a Yale, OK?
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:52.080]   So montane, I say in my upcoming book, The Gutenberg Brethasies, raised the bar for taking
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.080]   part in the conversation.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.440]   You had to become a writer.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   And if you were a writer, yes, you could get books published and you could be part of
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440]   the public conversation.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   But if you were, if you were scared of writing, if you weren't that literate, you were kind
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.280]   of left out for a very long time.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.360]   What the internet did, I think, was change that.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.280]   The internet said, you can use memes.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.480]   You can make emojis.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.360]   You can-- or you can use emojis.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.120]   You can make little videos.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.120]   You can just make posts.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.120]   You can make tweets.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.640]   It's all OK.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.760]   But that wasn't making enough money for folks.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:25.000]   So now we're kind of going back to the dime store montane is that everybody has to be a
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.520]   creator in a new literacy of online.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.200]   I have a question for you from the peanut gallery.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.000]   Can we drink if you say montane?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Is that OK?
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Is that part of the--
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.800]   I don't think you'll get clunk enough because I won't say it.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.880]   He brings it up every show.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.000]   I do not.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   I do not.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.240]   I've not brought up montane.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.520]   You brought montane up last week.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.080]   No, I did not.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.080]   Which was, yes, which is a lot for a 16th century French essay.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.960]   That's all I've got to say.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.720]   I swear to you, you did.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.120]   Jason, Jason, did I bring it up last week?
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.000]   Get him, Stacy.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Geez.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.480]   All right.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:15.560]   By the way, to confirm what your supposition was at the end of his Axios piece, Scott Rosenberg
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:20.640]   writes, Facebook's sunsetting of its own social network could open a new space for innovation
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:27.040]   on this turf where relative newcomers like Discord are already beginning to thrive.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.520]   So that's the question I would have.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.320]   I mean, I think TikTok's going to survive.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.720]   I think Instagram might survive.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.960]   What about Twitter?
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.600]   Because I love Twitter.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   Twitter's different.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.240]   What's Twitter in?
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.240]   It's a--
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   It's a conversation.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240]   Twitter is a conversation.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.240]   You'll get it right.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.800]   It's not social in Instagram.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   Is it social?
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.360]   It's social too.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.280]   It's definitely social in my book.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.400]   I feel like when you're posting on Twitter, it's a hybrid of content create.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.680]   So you're posting for an audience.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.240]   You're not posting for your friends.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.240]   That's what--
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.240]   It is a total mix.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.880]   But I feel like you're posting for your audience.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.440]   So I feel like on Twitter, you know who you communicate with and you find things that
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.440]   you think.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.440]   Well, that's true.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.920]   Like, what I see is-- but that's not necessarily true of like 60 minutes.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.880]   They're posting for an imaginary audience.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:28.800]   But when Salt Hank posts to a admittedly large audience, he's posting to his people.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.400]   And he's very aware of that.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.320]   The people who like what he does.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.320]   And influencers.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.000]   So it's-- but there's still broadcast in the sense that--
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Well, he's a creator.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.640]   Yeah, he's still a creator of that sense.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.360]   Because what you do is you look at how many people follow him and how many people he follows.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.360]   I don't want to use him as a fan of it.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:50.680]   It's people who are influencers, content creators, follow very few people relative to
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.400]   the number of people who follow them.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.760]   It is still broadcast.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:00.840]   Whereas if you go into Discord, you're following a channel, not even individuals, you're saying,
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.400]   I want to be part-- you know, I'm in the Lisp Discord.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.720]   I'm talking with other whispers, right?
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.640]   And so that's what you're following as a subject.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.120]   Or maybe it's your family.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.080]   Auntie's your family have a Discord or anything like that where you all talk.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.080]   We have a Slack.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.080]   Slack.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.080]   We have a Slack.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.080]   We use Slack.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.760]   It's everybody's following the same thing and there's different channels in there to talk
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.520]   about different discussions and whatnot.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.720]   I would submit that your family's doing that because Facebook no longer served them.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.720]   Interesting.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.720]   What do you think?
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.720]   Yes.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.080]   Well, for us, it was Hangouts.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.680]   We wanted a group chat where we could have fun amongst ourselves when we're not all in
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:50.040]   the same room and still just be able to socially chat and not always say, "Hey, make sure you
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.040]   clean up your room."
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   That kind of thing.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.200]   You know, just have conversation.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.840]   But that wasn't happening in Facebook.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.240]   That wasn't happening in Messenger.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.720]   That wasn't happening in WhatsApp.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.720]   Right.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.720]   Right.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:08.160]   I think it's a social network that is of your Dunbar number, your 150, your people, right?
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.920]   Whether it's family or friends.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.280]   And that's to me more like the future.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.280]   I don't know.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   Is it the future of social?
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.960]   I hope so.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:18.960]   I like it.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.240]   I'm fine with the smaller number.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.840]   You can still have photos.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.000]   You still have your platforms everywhere else.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.720]   I enjoy what I get out of Twitter because it is, like you said, a bit of a hybrid for
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.480]   someone like me.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.160]   I don't follow as many people that follow me.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.400]   And I am either broadcasting or I'm engaging.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.800]   You know, it's one of the others.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.280]   Do you use the Twitter website or the Twitter app?
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.640]   What do you use?
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   Both.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:54.560]   So my experience now with the Twitter app and website is it's so jammed with recommendations.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.280]   Accounts I don't follow.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.400]   It's becoming a lot like Instagram with a lot of crap in it.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.400]   So I use...
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   A lot of the algorithm stuff does bother me.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.400]   It's becoming very algorithmic.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.400]   That's why I use lists, man.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.400]   So lists or...
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.400]   Yep.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.720]   I just showed tweet deck which I use because it doesn't have the promoted stuff.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.160]   This promoted stuff's driving me crazy on the official Twitter feed.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   They got a urn button.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.160]   I understand.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.800]   Yeah, they have to earn money.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   I understand.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.040]   It's getting in the way.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:25.880]   So this is by the way why Twitter historically has had problems generating revenue.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.920]   That's why like what Mr. Jarvis said, having the list is definitely helpful.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:31.920]   I do that.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.920]   That's all I do.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.920]   I check lists all day long.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   Hardly ever going down.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.920]   How many lists do you have to hit?
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   You check.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:42.360]   Let's see here because Twitter is open.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.760]   I think I have like eight.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.560]   See, tweet deck.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.160]   See what I'm doing with tweet deck?
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.360]   I have my home which is my Twitter feed.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.680]   But then the two lists that I'm following are tech VIPs and top 25 tech reporters.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.680]   But that will change.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.840]   Those are columns.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.840]   And they're auto updating.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.480]   I don't see promoted tweets.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:06.640]   I've been seeing the same tweet for six months about Elon Musk is more than just boring tunnels
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.280]   and whatever is rushing rockets.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.960]   Here are his nine favorite books.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.360]   That same promoted tweet.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.360]   Do you see it?
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.360]   Do you see it?
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.360]   No, I don't see it.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.360]   It's just you.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.360]   Stries me nuts.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.360]   I promoted tweets.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.840]   Twitter knows I'm a woman in it.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.160]   I feel real bad for women.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.840]   I mean, yeah, you see what Twitter thinks of women, don't you?
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:36.480]   But it's kind of nice because because I'm not that I mean, I am a woman who does like
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.560]   things that women like, but I don't use Twitter that way.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.560]   It's weird to me because they're so jarring.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:47.720]   It's like how to cook your family dinner and then I'm back into like networking arguments.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.680]   It's like.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:55.640]   But that's kind of my complaint as well is that the Twitter feed is is full of other
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.640]   stuff.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:01.080]   So I use tweet deck because what I use Twitter for may be different from you guys, but I
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.760]   like to use it as a news feed.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.760]   I don't.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.760]   Yeah, me too.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.760]   It's like what's going on.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.120]   And if you follow the right people or you follow the right lists, then you know what's going
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.120]   on on the list.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.520]   But when I talk when I put something up there, I don't think I'm broadcasting to the world.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.840]   I think I'm talking to people like a show like this just exactly like this.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.840]   You haven't.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.040]   But that's broadcasting in audience when you when you know because I'm waiting for their
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.040]   responses.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.560]   I'm eager to hear what they say.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.560]   It's not necessarily mass.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.920]   So I feel like that is different.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:38.960]   And yeah, and I'm eager to hear about like what people think and I engage actively in conversations
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.200]   with people too.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   So maybe it's the last social network.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:49.000]   Maybe Scott Rosie is right, but it's also there is one surviving social network.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.920]   I think they figured out a way if they could figure out a way to make money.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.800]   I think they figured out a fairly decent model.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.120]   I know you've hated Twitter, but for people who like it, it really like Twitter works
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.120]   for me.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:08.880]   No, you know, I've come around because I think the way I use Twitter has evolved.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.000]   And so I don't hate it anymore.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.880]   I don't engage in conversation on it.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.880]   There you go.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:19.320]   Which for me is a is a way of avoiding the negative stuff.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.240]   You guys get a lot out of your conversations, I guess.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.800]   And I don't pay much attention to the app mentions.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.880]   I'm not looking at people talking to me.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.200]   I'm looking at the broadcasters, I guess your broadcaster.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.920]   Well, but I am.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.680]   When I post on Twitter, it is, hey, we just put out a new show or, you know, it's promotional.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.800]   You know what we're not talking about?
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.440]   Which probably is interesting.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.440]   Are advertisers LinkedIn?
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.960]   Oh, no, I just quit LinkedIn.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.960]   I love LinkedIn.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.960]   I just quit it.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.960]   What?
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.960]   Really?
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.360]   Because you haven't yet.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.360]   It was its turn.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   It was his turn.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.360]   This is later.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.360]   Oh, he's just like this.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.360]   All right, now I'm going to hit on LinkedIn.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.440]   There's nothing wrong with LinkedIn.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.600]   But I'm not looking for real.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.440]   You know what Leo just quit point cast.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.440]   Yes.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.200]   Everybody should know I'd like to put out a blog post.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.200]   I don't know.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.840]   What's the point of me being on LinkedIn?
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.760]   Yeah, good point.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:18.440]   Well, so here I actually get a ton like I treat LinkedIn almost like a broadcast network for
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.360]   me like two years where I talk to people.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:25.160]   But LinkedIn, man, my stories when I post stories on LinkedIn, probably because I'm more
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.160]   technical.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.520]   And you have value.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.520]   Not to a.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.640]   Yeah, broad consumer audience.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.720]   Man, readers love my stuff.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.720]   Great engagement.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.720]   Lisa says the same thing.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.120]   She gets great engagement.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.120]   And she loves the article she gets her LinkedIn.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.120]   So yeah.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.800]   So now Mr. LaPorte, I would say you could still still be on the lead.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.680]   Excuse me, still be on LinkedIn.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.400]   Not necessarily because you're looking for a job, but maybe just part of the networking
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:55.440]   standpoint of growing Twitmore is something.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.600]   Yeah, you promote business audience is where you're at.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.440]   Yeah, are you not promoting the show?
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.440]   Yeah, care.
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.920]   And if you do like little audio clips, people love those.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.920]   That's not my key.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:07.920]   I love that.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.920]   We have a marketing team.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.920]   We have a social team.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.280]   If they want to do that, they can.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:17.120]   I do not engage in those kinds of pandering, wrestling activities.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.520]   I want like the whole segment posted on LinkedIn.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.920]   And could you also insult your LinkedIn audience?
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.920]   That's what they mean.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.640]   If you're watching this on LinkedIn, I don't want to be a member of a club that would have
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.560]   me as a member.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:37.440]   And I feel that if I have to promote what I'm doing, clearly, I'm doing it wrong.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.240]   Oh my God.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.880]   If it's cruel, welcome to me.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.840]   I will not go to the world.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.840]   Really what it is is late stage broadcaster.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:47.840]   I don't care anymore.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.840]   I just I give up.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:49.840]   Yeah, I don't care anymore.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.840]   I get it.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:51.840]   If I were.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:52.840]   I think it's your old and introverted thing.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:53.840]   I'm old and introverted.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.840]   Another way of saying it.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:56.840]   That's growing.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.840]   Old, I'm introverted.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.240]   And that's why I use these platforms.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:06.600]   Because it's easier for me, you know, it's easier for me as an introvert to just broadcast
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:13.240]   from the keyboard and just was way more comfortable versus me going out here in the streets broadcasting
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.320]   myself, you know, in the streets.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.880]   What are you going to do in the water?
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.880]   I mean, I was at which board on.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:27.920]   I have done my cold calls in my day.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.320]   Oh, I don't do that.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.960]   Totally fine doing cold calls to drum up business.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:39.320]   But I am much more comfortable code calling from the phone or using the keyboard here.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.560]   I trained for full brush salesmen.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.200]   I knew it was not for me.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   Same.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   Same.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   You did too.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.200]   I did.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.280]   I was I was an insurance agent for a few years.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.040]   I was an insurance agent for really.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:59.280]   So somebody said if I'm going to have that elitist attitude, I should wear it away.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.400]   Now we're talking now.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.960]   Now how much would you pay?
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.320]   Oh, Leo, you got a hair on the Briré.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.320]   You've got some dog hair action.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.800]   Who's been wearing my Briré?
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.880]   I tell you, Leo, but it's your color.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.800]   This is this is a this is inside.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.040]   Frey Basque, Med and France.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.040]   I need the monocle.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.600]   Somebody's chatting at me.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.600]   Get the monocle.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.600]   All right.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.600]   I don't know.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.040]   Does a Briré go with a monocle?
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.440]   No, a Briré.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.960]   A monocle goes with a top hat.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.960]   The Briré goes with a jaunty bandana.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.480]   Oh, I need a next scarf and ask that if you will.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.480]   I'll ask that.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.760]   I'll get that in a moment.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.120]   And it must be jaunty.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.120]   A jaunty.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.120]   And a galois cigar.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.120]   Thank you, Burelle.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:56.400]   We're going to take a little break because I don't care about you people.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.400]   I'm going to go away.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.280]   Screw you.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.600]   You Americans make me sick.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.440]   Now I hear Miss Lisa Scherer.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.440]   No, not into the ad.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:17.000]   No, not into the ad.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.160]   Can we take a little break?
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.320]   Because I do have to do an ad.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:24.800]   And when we come back, how funny was last week?
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.400]   Do I need to wear hats, accents, mustaches?
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.560]   What did we laugh about last week?
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.640]   I can't remember, guys.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.200]   I laughed at you most of the time.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.200]   Yeah, there's some honesty.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:43.320]   You and your notion of being just a regular guy and like, come on, dude, you got a theme
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.320]   song.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.960]   Oh, yeah, we talked about AR classes.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.600]   We had some good stuff there.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.480]   We did a real support with all.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.400]   And then messy, broad.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.280]   And we didn't talk about Elon Musk.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   That's what it was.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.760]   Oh, no wonder it was so.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.160]   Stacey, Stacey, we're a few.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.360]   It was going in.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.480]   Stacey was walking.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.840]   If we said anything about anything of his bodily fluids, it was not going to happen.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   Ew.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.640]   This is true.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:18.160]   Ladies and gentlemen, the truth from Elon Musk, the media is a click seeking machine dressed
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.680]   up as a truth seeking machine.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.440]   Wait a minute, I should see that.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.440]   How profound.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.440]   Okay.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:28.880]   No, no, don't give him any sort of credit.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.880]   That's stupid.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:30.880]   That's a bit.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.880]   He is a click seeking robot.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:44.160]   The media is a click seeking machine, masquerading as a truth seeking machine.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:49.160]   So there, would you like to see my chest, my naked bed.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.760]   I can listen to a GIF.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.760]   Which we also didn't do last week.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.920]   He's the white with no hair to be perceived in any point.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:05.680]   And if you are billionaire who would like to hose me down, come on over.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.640]   I'm worried that you're feverish, but also this is very good.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.640]   I'm just not mad for Paris.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.400]   I'm like, oh, this is excellent.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:18.200]   I do remember one time in Paris, we were at Notre Dame and there's a taxi stand there
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.280]   and it starts to rain.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   Or maybe with snow.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:27.880]   It started to snow and we walk up to the taxi and we say, can we get the taxi driver rolls
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.880]   up the window?
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:29.880]   I just say, right?
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.240]   It opens a newspaper and ignores us.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.240]   Nice.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.240]   Nice.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.280]   I don't drive into snow.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.880]   I respect that.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.880]   All right.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.880]   You're peasant.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.800]   It's not getting in my presence.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.280]   Yeah, I will give you a ride, but not we need to snipe.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.720]   No, sir.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.720]   You must walk.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.720]   We did.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:50.720]   Back to the hotel.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:51.720]   Oh my God.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.720]   It wouldn't be peasants.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.360]   It would be bourgeoisie.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.360]   You bourgeoisie.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.840]   You think I am here for you?
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:03.440]   I am not here to serve you.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:09.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, our show today brought to you by the good folks at ClickUp.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:13.560]   Wouldn't it be nice if you could get one extra day a week?
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.640]   Just like to do stuff you care about cooking healthy meals or write in that great American
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:24.160]   novel, maybe build binging some good reality TV, dressing up in costumes and speaking in
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.280]   French accents, whatever it is, you would do in your free time.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.280]   Well, it is possible to get a little free time with ClickUp.

[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:44.000]   day a week on work, a day a week guaranteed.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.400]   ClickUp began with a premise that something's broken in productivity.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.320]   There are too many tools to keep track of.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.320]   You know this.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.320]   You've experienced it.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.560]   Too many things in entirely separate ecosystems.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.400]   I got this there and that there and there.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:00.000]   There has to be a more productive way to get through the daily hustle.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.400]   ClickUp is the one tool that houses all your tasks, all your projects, your docs, your goals,

[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:32.480]   If you're an engineering, yes, if you're in sales, you need ClickUp marketing.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.480]   You need ClickUp HR.

[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.640]   That's like a buck 25 a day.

[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.320]   I saw that.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   You think because I'm not the biggest.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.240]   I was putting clothes in the dryer.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:08.240]   Okay.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.760]   So that's that's that's your air fryer for waffles.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.760]   I know.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   It's a new way to cook them.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.040]   Close in the dryer.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.560]   It's not waffle time yet.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.960]   Waffle time hits around before 15.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:22.960]   It's an hour after.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   It's waffle time.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:28.280]   Well, later on, we might well learn how to use a paper bag and a hairdryer to air fry
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.760]   a pizza from prison.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.760]   But we'll get to that later.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:31.760]   Is it a TikTok?
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.760]   Of course, of course.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.760]   Yes.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:35.760]   You in TikTok.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   You in TikTok.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.880]   I'm the future, right?
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.240]   I was on TikTok before Zuckerberg started it.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.440]   I'm there on TikTok.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.440]   I'm part of the future.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.160]   I think it's not important, but I'm going to since we're here, I'll bring it up.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:53.400]   There've been a couple of stories this week about TikTok one using its new now gone news
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:57.760]   feed to feed Americans disinformation.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:02.320]   And there's now some this is a story from Gizmodo leak documents from within TikTok reveal
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:07.040]   how the company games out responses to tricky questions.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.640]   In other words, how they handle PR.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.640]   It's a PR trove of PR documents.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.640]   Gizmodo got it.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:19.120]   TikTok master messaging and TikTok key messages.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.920]   Both are explanations of press talking points in English.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:27.600]   They include a version translated into an unnamed European language.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.920]   Why is this secret language?
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.400]   Well, Gizmodo is not naming the language to protect the sourcing of the document.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.520]   That's a small place.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.520]   What do you mean?
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.360]   I don't have any documents.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.440]   The larger the two, a 53 page TikTok master messaging document.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.920]   Actually, I would love to see this.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.640]   I don't think it's an indictment of TikTok.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:51.640]   Every company.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:52.640]   No, it's everybody has this.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.640]   Doesn't say it doesn't.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.640]   Doesn't every big company do something like this?
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:56.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:00.280]   And you have Q and A's about what are the questions we're most vulnerable to?
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   What are our answers to?
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.280]   What are yeah?
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.280]   Sure, they are.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:09.240]   So among other things you could completely predict is downplay the parent company ByteDance,
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:16.680]   downplay the China Association, it's owned by China, downplay AI, emphasize TikTok as
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.160]   a brand slash platform.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:25.600]   Employees should stress that although young people love TikTok, this is exactly the PR
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.600]   speak.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.640]   You can see it coming from their mouths.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.280]   So young people love TikTok.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:35.680]   The app is only for users age 13 and above because of course.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.920]   Well, that's an admission.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.000]   We would get an admission that people under 13 are using it because how else would they
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   know that they love it?
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   I love it.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.800]   I don't know.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.520]   I'm a little biased and I know you are too.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.840]   Jeff, we love TikTok.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:57.640]   I don't see, I could see the potential if they're starting to feed me Chinese propaganda.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:58.640]   Right.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.640]   But you know what?
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.880]   What if they're convincing you to take Tide Pods?
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:08.360]   Which by the way, is complete moral panic, right?
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.360]   Yes.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.360]   I know.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:15.720]   And this is the local news media, especially local TV loves this.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.360]   Oh, kids are eating Tide Pods.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.160]   Thanks to TikTok.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.000]   None of this is really what's going on on TikTok.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.840]   I mean, the misinformation I see on TikTok is the same misinformation.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:32.120]   I can find on podcasts, Twitter, YouTube, and newspapers and magazines.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.840]   Because it's human beings spreading it.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:39.480]   So one of the people, actually, the fun thing about the cruise is to get to meet our audience.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.120]   We have a really interesting audience.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:46.560]   One of the people in our audience, and he came down in his dress uniform at the fancy
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.240]   meal works for the army.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.240]   I said, well, what do you do?
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.880]   He says, I'm in human.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.880]   I said, what?
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:52.880]   Human.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:53.880]   Human intelligence.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:54.880]   Human intelligence.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.480]   I said, oh, that's interesting.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.640]   He said, yeah, was that out of a grave?
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.080]   I was an interrogator.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.080]   Whoa.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.520]   I want to go home.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.520]   I want to go home.
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.520]   Very nice to you, sir.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:09.600]   Later today, we'll do a demonstration on waterboarding and its uses.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.800]   But he was a sweet guy, really nice guy.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.520]   He was not torturing people.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.000]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.720]   He would work with an interpreter.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.880]   He said, you know, you get a lot of people who want to tell you stuff.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.400]   So you, you know, yeah, you talk to him.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.400]   You know, you get the information.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   Does there be waterboard it?
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.080]   Well, no, I don't think he was torturing anybody.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.800]   He was too sweet a guy.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:42.520]   But he did say with a darkly ominous tone that civilians have no idea the depths that
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:48.680]   foreign governments are going to to subvert our democracy, to subvert our beliefs, to
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:55.480]   create dissension and chaos in this country using, you know, a variety of techniques,
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.560]   social media, and the platform.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.600]   I mean, this isn't an eye opener.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.520]   But you're going after the vulnerable who are already leading that way and they push
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.520]   them.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.520]   Exactly.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.520]   They don't push everybody.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.720]   They push a very few and a very few spread that is information.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.680]   And so all it takes, you know, all you have to do is go to Trump and get the sample of
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.680]   live on media.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:21.720]   And you know what though, I'm more and more convinced, whatever that number is, the 30%
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:27.600]   that are mush minds have always been that way and always will be that way.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.600]   Yes.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:34.520]   And will always be susceptible, but it doesn't have to take Russia or China to do it.
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.520]   It can be.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.520]   It can be.
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.520]   It also, I'll even stall points out that that we have a constitution that enables that
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.800]   30% to end up running the country.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.080]   Well, there is a problem there and a problem that should be probably structurally fixed,
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:48.720]   which is that we do have a minority rule situation in the US.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:53.520]   Now it's even more dramatic because we have essentially have a Supreme Court that is there
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:59.200]   for life that is unelected, that is essentially going to change the face of American life.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.200]   But let's not talk about that.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.440]   Let's talk about pink sauce.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.200]   We were saying before we'll get.
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.560]   No, pink sauce.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:09.920]   We were saying before the show, but I want to reiterate that recommendation, which Jeff
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:17.000]   gave us during the quiz I was reading, allow me to retort Ellie Mistall, M-Y-S-T-A-L's stunning
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.520]   book, a black guy's guide to the Constitution.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.520]   You were listening to it.
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:22.520]   I was listening to it.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:23.520]   I was important to it.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.840]   I was recommended on Audible because his voice is amazing.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:31.400]   And it's very powerful, very, very hard to disagree with.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.400]   Absolutely.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.400]   Highly recommend it.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:38.000]   M-Y-S-T-A-L, allow me to retort on Audible's very good.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.800]   It's tasty.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.440]   Is there anything better than pink sauce?
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.440]   Yes.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.440]   Yes.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.440]   There is.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.080]   How about some Google news?
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:54.560]   So you remember the, what was he, a Wiccan, the engineer/pagan?
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.560]   He was a Christian mystic.
[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.280]   Pagan, Pagan, Pagan.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:06.360]   Blake Lemoine, the guy who said, "Oh my God, Lambda's become sentient."
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.960]   Well, Google's finally just fired the guy.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.640]   It's like, no, no, it's not sentient.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.680]   And you're not doing us any favors.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.680]   You're not.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.480]   I have to say I agree with him, right?
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.040]   I mean, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.040]   It was the right move.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.680]   It was the right move.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.720]   What about this one?
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.600]   This, I have a Hello Doorbell.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.280]   That's the Google Nest Hello Doorbell.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.280]   Oh, this is trouble.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.480]   Is this a CNET story?
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.480]   Yes.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.480]   Yes.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:40.360]   I also had an Amazon Ring Doorbell, which I maybe foolishly replaced with the Google
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:46.360]   Hello Doorbell because we'd heard so much about how Ring was handing over stuff to local
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.360]   police.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.280]   Well, now it turns out Google does the same thing.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.280]   Without consent.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.280]   Yes.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.280]   And without warrants.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.280]   Right, Chris.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.280]   Well, okay.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.280]   So, yeah.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.160]   So this is an important story.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.920]   And Ryan did a great job here.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:09.160]   So he talked to a bunch of camera makers and the two big ones, Google and Ring, when police
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.320]   have what they call emergency orders or emergency requests.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.600]   And those are intended to be like somebody's dying, right?
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600]   Right.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.680]   Like there's a shooting happening right now where there was a kidnapping or something
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.080]   big when the police make a request, an emergency request, they don't need a warrant.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.800]   They don't need a subpoena and they don't need to tell the user.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.320]   They just pull the video.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.920]   There's no company wants the headline.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:37.160]   There was video of this guy being murdered.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.920]   What was the famous story, Jeff in New York City where the poor woman was being?
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.080]   Well, it turned out it was absolutely wrong.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080]   But his false.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.080]   It's a false story.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.080]   Oh, well, then never mind.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.080]   I won't be able to.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.080]   In a day's day.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.080]   But, but do nobody wants to be.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.720]   Kitty, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, nobody wants that headline.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.080]   It was a moral panic of his time of its time that people thought that she was being murdered
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.160]   and nobody stepped in and that turns out not true.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.760]   It's a typical urban legend.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.760]   But nevertheless.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.760]   But no one wants to see a four year old get murdered on their ring camera and find out
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.760]   that the police could have stopped.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:12.360]   By the way, Google and thanks to the chat room for putting this up at 145 today released
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.720]   a statement that they shared with nine to five Google quote Google has clarified the
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.080]   company has never exercised its ability to share footage with law enforcement to date.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.720]   So they haven't done it to date, but feels that it is quote important to reserve the
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.360]   right to do so.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.960]   But in those kinds of cases, do they limit it to that?
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   In those kinds of cases.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.600]   So ring did it 11 times and they told at 11 times last year, they told Senator Marky
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:41.880]   this in response to a letter that he sent to them.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.640]   Some things to note about this that I think are really important.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:51.000]   Emergency requests are the same thing that hackers abuse to get access to people's private
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.280]   Facebook accounts.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.480]   They spoofed a police officers credentials, basically a police station's credentials and
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.640]   said, Hey, we want an emergency request for these accounts.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.680]   They got access to private photos and then did an extortion kind of thing.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:08.840]   So these are not fail proof or fail safe for whatever the word I'm picking up is.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.040]   But cool proof.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.200]   Nothing is.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.160]   So so that's one.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.520]   These don't happen often.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.560]   What's really upsetting is ring says that they didn't notify the people.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.000]   So like they pulled this data.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.680]   They shared it with the police, but they didn't tell the camera owner that they did this.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.280]   Actually what they said is when asked if they shared this information with the owner, they
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.240]   didn't respond.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.000]   So that's not great.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.480]   They shared it with the owner, but the owner ignored them.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.240]   Sorry, they shared it with the police.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.240]   Police.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.240]   They didn't tell the owner.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.740]   Yeah, that is wrong.
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:47.740]   That's right.
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.740]   That's wrong.
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.740]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.740]   Well, I mean, it depends on your point of view.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:58.700]   There's no reason that you couldn't save somebody in emergency and tell the people on
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:01.180]   the camera that they use their camera.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:04.900]   That could go hand in hand without any risk.
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:05.900]   They just.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.900]   And they probably should.
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:12.380]   And then the other thing to note is Arlo got back to them and they were like, yeah, we
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.380]   don't do that ever.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.380]   Nor does anchor.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.380]   Nor does UFI right?
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.380]   UFI is a.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.380]   That has problems too.
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:19.380]   Why?
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:20.380]   He doesn't do it, right?
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.380]   Why?
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:26.460]   Because I mean, I guess we could see a four year old getting murdered in their front porch
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:30.540]   with a wise cam or a wise doorbell, which would be terrible.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.780]   But the other thing, where was I going to go with this?
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:41.380]   Oh, oh, if you have a ring doorbell and you do two way encryption, they can't pull that
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.580]   video.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:46.340]   So you could actually stop this by turning a two way encryption.
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:51.140]   What's interesting is if you do that with ring, ring is very careful to tell you, hey,
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:56.220]   then you can't send your ring data to your ring video camera data to other devices in
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:59.140]   your home and certain other features will work.
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.780]   So most people decide not to do it.
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:02.780]   Apple.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:04.580]   Is there an associate if you with that encryption?
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.580]   No, it's free.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:07.580]   Take a question.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:10.220]   I'll do that someday soon.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.220]   Can I?
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.620]   Wait, I want to say one thing.
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:15.220]   Apple lets you.
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.900]   Is it apples to apples or apples to ring?
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:24.220]   Apple does encrypted end to end video as part of their home kit secure video and they have
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.380]   figured out a way.
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.980]   Ironically, they don't sell a camera.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:28.980]   Right.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:34.380]   But they do work with Logitech and KUFI for their stuff.
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:38.220]   And you can see that on Apple devices within their ecosystem.
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:43.100]   So they have figured out how to do end to end encryption without breaking the features
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.300]   that ring cannot do.
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.300]   And that could just be--
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:47.580]   What should the policy be, Stacy?
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.660]   What would your prescription be?
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:57.260]   If you answer emergency requests, you should put out a report as a tech company noting
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.260]   when that happens.
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.260]   A transparency report.
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.260]   I agree.
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.260]   Yeah, a transparency report.
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:04.140]   I do think you should tell the users.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:09.420]   I can see if the person is a suspect during the emergency.
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:10.420]   Ah, good point.
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.300]   Maybe you didn't want to tell them afterwards.
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:19.660]   I'm like, there's some things that we'd have to figure out how that should look.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:25.740]   And I think you probably should turn on end to end encryption and make it easier.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.540]   I know that means people can't get it.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:33.820]   But if you want surveillance video, then have your municipality go through the public
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:35.460]   process to get those up.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:39.900]   So we're not saying it's a bad thing for police to say.
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:40.900]   It's an emergency.
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.620]   A child's being abducted.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:47.100]   I could we need that video now ring and for ring to provide it.
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:48.780]   We're not saying that's a bad thing.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:49.780]   Are we?
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.380]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.380]   I think it's good.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.380]   No, I don't.
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:59.100]   I think it creates a network of privately owned but publicly accessible surveillance that
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:00.460]   could be a problem.
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.460]   That's an interesting point.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.460]   Interesting.
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.460]   Interesting.
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:04.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.300]   So it's different from the city having a camera in London on damn near every corner.
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.300]   It's the city's camera.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.300]   Well, I'm not real fun about it either.
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.100]   Well, we're not.
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:16.740]   But so there's actually a really interesting case right now in New Orleans.
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:21.140]   They had stopped using facial recognition, but like two or three years ago.
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:26.020]   But now because of like an uptick in crime during the pandemic, they voted recently to
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:29.300]   allow facial recognition on their public cameras.
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.900]   But they did that sort of publicly.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.060]   The same thing that's happening in San Francisco.
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:37.620]   We talked about it a couple of weeks ago, I think they're looking to use actually San
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:41.300]   Francisco, they're looking to use private cameras for that.
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:46.700]   But anyway, the point is if you want this sort of surveillance, you should have to get
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:50.140]   that surveillance in a public forum.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:51.980]   That's the bottom line for me.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:53.500]   And I don't think we can't.
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:08:00.980]   People would be so concerned if they trusted police or government.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:04.820]   I think the real issue and it's hard to take me seriously when I'm wearing a lens.
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:05.820]   Yes, it is.
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:06.820]   Yes.
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:07.820]   It's cold.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:17.860]   The real issue is that we don't trust government or police to do the right thing with this information.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.860]   Right?
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:19.860]   Right.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:20.860]   That's the fundamental issue.
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:23.660]   I don't think you could trust anyone to do the right thing.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:28.380]   I mean, this is absolute power, which we all know per ROPS absolute.
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:34.340]   You don't want a surveillance state, A. So I, you know, that's part of the problem.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:40.300]   But also, and this goes back to Eileen Estelle, who really says, if you want to solve the
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:46.020]   problems with police in this country, you just, you simply enforce the Fourth Amendment,
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.060]   the right against unreasonable search and seizure.
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.060]   This is covered by the Fourth Amendment.
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:53.620]   You have a right to privacy.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:09:01.740]   And we're, people are afraid of what an untamed police force, which in many jurisdictions
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:06.660]   is the case, will do with the access to this kind of video.
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:08.820]   All kinds of things, right?
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:15.740]   I think this conversation is getting a big boost from things like the DOP's decision,
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.740]   because now all of a sudden we're recognizing that.
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:18.740]   Yeah, what if you cross the streets around it?
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.420]   You're in a abortion clinic, right?
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.420]   Right.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.420]   Exactly.
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:26.580]   So is it an emergency if someone's thinking about having an abortion?
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:30.060]   Maybe if you're in Texas, then you're arguing that someone's life is on the line.
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.060]   That's exactly right.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.060]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.060]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:35.060]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.060]   Yeah.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.060]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:38.060]   Some unborn fetus's life is on the line.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.060]   That's exactly right.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:41.380]   I should at least know that it got used once so I can tear it out and put it in an electric
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.380]   button.
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.580]   What's he talking about?
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:46.580]   Or that he's saying.
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:47.740]   Oh, if it has been used.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.380]   Or just use the armo.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:54.420]   But again, none of this would be an issue if we trusted police.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:58.980]   And because we don't, many people, rightly so, don't, I think, especially if you're a
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:04.900]   person of color, don't trust police, it doesn't matter what transparency reports or what Google
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:13.420]   says or what, you know, why says this stuff is you're taking these videos.
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:15.220]   It's out there.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:20.980]   And so maybe you, it's a shame that property owners need to encrypt to prevent, you know,
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:23.620]   unlawful use of this stuff, but maybe the way we do.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:28.700]   Well, then the next flip, I'll throw this out there because there's tons of TikTok videos
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:34.140]   of people like showing off people at their doors.
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:35.940]   Like we saw this video.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:36.940]   Oh, all the time.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.940]   And it's the homeowner.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:38.940]   Right.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:39.940]   Or go into neighborhood.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:40.940]   Good ex guy.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.700]   Go into neighborhood or that app, right?
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:46.260]   You know, there's a black man walking up and down the street.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.260]   Here's the video.
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:49.580]   Now, it's not even just like a black person.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:50.580]   It's like people like.
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.580]   It often is though.
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.580]   I'm petaluma.
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:55.460]   There's some black guy walking around.
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.300]   I don't know if I trust him.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.300]   That's it.
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:10:59.300]   The picture's not get off.
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.940]   He's after your espresso machine.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:06.740]   No, it's a shame, but Anne has to wear orange.
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:10.140]   It's a shame that do not want to look suspicious.
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.420]   I want you to see me out there.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.620]   It makes me cry.
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.420]   It's terrible.
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.780]   It's terrible.
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:20.820]   And so this is all part of that.
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.180]   And yeah.
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:25.620]   Well.
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.380]   So that's why it's an issue.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:30.620]   It's one of these cases where this is Stacy.
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.620]   This is Stacy's line.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.180]   So then we need to talk about.
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.180]   Yes.
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:38.820]   Because there is a different level here where we'll figure out the norms we expect.
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.780]   We'll figure out what's right and wrong.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:47.860]   But we need, you know, it's like scold will go into the men's room at IO with his Google
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:50.980]   glass on and people freaking out.
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.140]   I should say next door.com not neighbors.
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.140]   Next door.
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.140]   Next door.
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.700]   Next door is in our chat room and as a person of color says, if I know that my video could
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:02.940]   prevent my fellow humans from being hurt, preventing a kidnapping or murder or anything,
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.540]   I'd be more than happy to help.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.540]   I'd say that much.
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:06.540]   I agree.
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.540]   We're not saying that.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.540]   We're not saying that.
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.540]   We're worried about misuse.
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:11.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:14.860]   And you know, they have not an emergency situation.
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:18.380]   They can totally use that for they can ask you for your data.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:22.380]   The police will come to you and be like, there's a form they get to fill out and bring
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:28.300]   talks to you and you can share, you basically say, yeah, you can have my data to solve this
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.300]   crime.
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:30.300]   Like there's a bunch of car thieves.
[01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:32.380]   A car was stolen in front of your camera.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:36.900]   Can we have a video that I would share that?
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:37.900]   Absolutely.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.300]   Well, here's the other case though.
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:47.220]   If you're a journalist, you, the norm has been you share with police what you've already
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:50.060]   shared with the public and no more.
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:52.220]   But there's an argument to say that that's wrong.
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:56.680]   Look at what's happening on January 6th of those filmmakers who had followed the Proud
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.860]   Boys and followed the Trump's had said, no, we're journalists.
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:01.060]   Well, you watch our film.
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.060]   That's it.
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.580]   We wouldn't have things that we have.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:12.380]   So it's, it's what's your right to withhold in a case of public interest?
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.860]   That's a question.
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.820]   We shouldn't have been that interesting.
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:17.820]   Okay.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:18.820]   See, Stacy?
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:19.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:20.820]   We should talk about that.
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:21.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:22.820]   We should talk about that.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:24.540]   But what is pink sauce?
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.460]   That's what people really want to know.
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.660]   All right, fine.
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:34.100]   Stacy, if you follow the pink sauce thing, I have, I have not fully followed the pink
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.100]   sauce thing.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.100]   Yeah.
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:37.300]   So this creator created something called pink sauce.
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.300]   It's got dragon fruit.
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.300]   It's got oils.
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.380]   We don't even know milk solids.
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:41.380]   Who knows what's in there?
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:43.300]   The issue is it went viral.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.780]   She started selling it.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.180]   People started realizing that she was selling it and shipping this, but it wasn't consistent.
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:55.300]   The nutrition labels that were on it seemed really sad and not quite well thought out.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:14:00.660]   So people started doubting both like the nutrition labels and their content as well as the safety
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:04.020]   of shipping something that contains milk and whatnot.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:08.500]   Honey, dragon fruit, sunflower seed oil, chili, and a minute garlic.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.500]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:13.060]   So this was essentially done out of the trunk of her car basically.
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:14.060]   That's the fear.
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.060]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.060]   Or, or the base but kitchen.
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:20.300]   I mean, look, my son, salt hank, sell salt.
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:23.220]   But he sells it for a salt company.
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.220]   I mean, he's not.
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.380]   He's not shipping it out of, yeah.
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:30.380]   His thing in the backyard or something.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.140]   He's like, oh, I found this salt in my backyard.
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:35.060]   Let me hear.
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:37.660]   So that's the issue is she's also added.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:43.140]   Please refrigerate to the label.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:48.060]   There was a typo mixing up the number of grams of product with a number of servings.
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.540]   There's 30 servings.
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.740]   He spelled vinegar.
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:55.220]   Totally 444 grams instead of 444 servings.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.580]   She misspelled vinegar.
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:00.020]   Well, yeah, you know, and the video, by the way, gone.
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.020]   I mean, there's nothing else.
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:05.020]   It shows the importance of paying attention to detail when you're trying to establish credibility
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.020]   for yourself in brand.
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.020]   Yeah.
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:08.020]   It's only two.
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.500]   It's sold out 700 bottles.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.500]   Big deal.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.980]   People get sick from pink sauce.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.940]   That's enough to try.
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:15.940]   It's a case.
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:16.940]   It's a lawsuits.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:17.940]   Yeah.
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:18.940]   It's a gourmet week.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.180]   The TikTok section here.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.300]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.300]   But wait.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.300]   Oh, wait.
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:24.300]   There's more.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.300]   There's more.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.300]   You've risen.
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:27.300]   Prison pizza.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:28.300]   Well, before you get to that, okay.
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:29.300]   You could do that.
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:30.300]   No, no, you're your choice.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.300]   No, no, you've got two pizza items.
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:32.700]   You've got two pizza items.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.600]   Pizza's, pizza's, that goes, that goes, that goes.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.180]   That's a quicker one.
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:37.980]   Let's start with pizza says on Twitter.
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:38.980]   Pizza's.
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:40.860]   A watermelon pizza.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:41.860]   No.
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:42.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:43.860]   No.
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.860]   No.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:45.860]   Oh.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:46.860]   Oh.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:47.860]   Oh.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:52.420]   That's just, but you see a lot of this on TikTok where they do something else with the crust.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:55.420]   Because honestly, the best part of pizza is not the crust.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:57.220]   It's the stuff on top of the crust.
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.940]   No, if you want to use watermelon.
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:15:59.940]   Eyes.
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:01.660]   No, you're a crust man.
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:02.660]   The crust can be amazing.
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:03.660]   Yeah, crust.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:04.660]   Oh, you're right.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:05.660]   All right.
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:06.660]   I'll take it back.
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:07.660]   But maybe watermelon is.
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.660]   Meanwhile, I won't agree.
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:10.340]   Watermelon with a little salt on top.
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:11.340]   It sounds so bad.
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:13.060]   I don't think this sounds so bad.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:14.700]   Okay, I thought it was, I thought it was bad.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:17.420]   All right, so then prison pizza.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:23.660]   The New York Times has a story about people sharing prison experience and what they do
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:24.660]   on TikTok.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:27.180]   And here's a lady who's going to show you how to make prison pizza.
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:31.500]   I'm not going to pay the sound because she looks really noisy and obnoxious.
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:32.660]   So I'll let you narrate this.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:33.660]   Heinz ketchup.
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:34.660]   So she makes, she makes V8s.
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:39.220]   This is things like crackers and V8 and ketchup and other things to make the sauce.
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.620]   She says the sauce is the hard thing to make.
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:44.700]   But then this is not an Italian person.
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.860]   I can tell you right now.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:47.020]   We'll get to him in a minute.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.420]   From a commissary, man.
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:49.420]   Come on.
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:50.420]   That's true.
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:52.180]   You only, you know, use what you can, you can make.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.180]   You can get.
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:58.540]   There's a really good prison book I listened to that goes into this about how you do things.
[01:16:58.540 --> 01:16:59.940]   A really good prison book.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.300]   So if you have to make Pruno now, you know, you have the means.
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:07.500]   Yes, it's a book called, it's another one you might actually enjoy reading.
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.980]   Put on your list here.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:09.980]   Okay.
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.980]   It's called.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:13.420]   Shoot, where is it?
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:15.660]   This sauce is so grotesque.
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:17.660]   Oh, now white bread.
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:18.660]   Okay.
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:19.660]   She's putting white bread in the bag.
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:20.660]   Well, shit up.
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:21.660]   Okay.
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:22.660]   Take it apart.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:23.660]   Her eyes are so blue.
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:24.860]   Is that, do you think that's real?
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:28.300]   That's, I've already scrolled down that she's scaring a crap.
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:32.500]   I think there's a filter going on because everything's very blue.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:33.500]   There's a lot of blue.
[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:34.500]   That's a good point.
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.500]   Yeah.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.500]   But the bread doesn't blue.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:37.500]   Thank God.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.900]   This is, and we should give her credit.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.700]   So you can all follow her.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.900]   Marcy Marie 114.
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:45.700]   M-A-R-C-I-M-A-R-I-E-1-1-4.
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:47.500]   Wait a minute.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:51.020]   She's, okay, she's put the bread in a plastic bag added water.
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.020]   She's pushing it up.
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:53.020]   She's pushing it up.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.740]   So basically you're turning bread into dough.
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:55.740]   She's making it cross.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:56.740]   Dough.
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:57.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:58.740]   She's making it cross.
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:17:59.740]   Yes.
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:00.740]   Dough.
[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:01.740]   Oh, she's reversing.
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:02.740]   Oh, she's doing this.
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.340]   So there she has, oh no, you don't want to eat it.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:06.340]   Oh.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.340]   But the interesting thing is coming up.
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:08.580]   It's coming up in a second.
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:12.340]   If I found this woman on my ring camera, I would turn it over to the police.
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:13.980]   She's using a hair dryer.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:15.340]   Here's the issue thing.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:19.180]   In a paper, a hair dryer, in a paper bag.
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:23.860]   And as the Times said, it's actually a very clever version of an air fryer.
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:24.860]   Yeah, it is.
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:27.100]   You're going to cause a prison fire.
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:28.100]   Okay.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:33.780]   And she's using a credit card there to cut up some sausage and a little ham.
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:38.140]   I guess if you're dying for a pizza, what is that peanut butter?
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:40.300]   I totally respect this.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:42.980]   It's a cheese of sorts.
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:43.980]   I like it.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:51.020]   I do say, okay, you know, I'm not going to eat it, but it's brown.
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:54.420]   And she's by the way, what you're looking for in a pizza?
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:19:02.980]   Oh, no, no, no, Marcy, Marcy Murray, don't eat that prison pizza, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:09.820]   So meanwhile, the bad news, the bad news is the guy we love, he's been told to stop making
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:13.220]   videos, the guy, the Italian guy with the sandwiches, the crazy sandwiches.
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:15.220]   Yeah.
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:16.220]   Why?
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:21.260]   Yeah, no, he was making the store store's life hell because it was getting all these tourists
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.260]   coming.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:25.020]   He was sandwiching too famous.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:30.020]   And he's so he has a tearful farewell on Twitter, right before he opens his Manhattan
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.020]   pop up sandwich shop.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.020]   Exactly.
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:34.020]   All right.
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:36.020]   And his new apartment.
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:41.460]   It is new penthouse appointment.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:46.260]   The K, this is the chaotic Italian sandwich man of TikTok.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:50.820]   Oh, we showed this where he just slapped stuff together.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.100]   But I thought he was in Italy.
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:53.100]   This guy's not in Italy.
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:54.100]   Isn't Italy?
[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:55.100]   Oh, it is in Italy.
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.060]   Oh, the Italians, they just don't know.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.060]   He's in Naples.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.060]   See, you can't be doing this, man.
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.900]   You got to stop too many people.
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:02.900]   Yeah, people in New York.
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:05.340]   Look at the size of that more to Della.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.340]   Holy cow.
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.220]   That's when he was uprising.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.220]   I did watch him constantly.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:13.780]   He was absolutely mess because it's only point out the red is always different sized.
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.780]   Yeah.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:15.780]   Because it's made in it.
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:16.780]   He cuts out the fresh.
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:17.780]   Oh, look at that more.
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:18.780]   He swaps it on there.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.780]   I don't know what's wrong with that.
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:22.860]   That cheese is not look good.
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:27.580]   When you cut off the side and there's not, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:30.300]   The cruffles in there, you think?
[01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:32.860]   Maybe maybe a little mold?
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:33.860]   I don't know.
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:35.300]   I'm still a little bit nervous.
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:36.660]   She's a little bit old, Lord.
[01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:41.020]   It's nothing better to look through a podcast with people looking at you at TikTok videos
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:42.180]   and describing them.
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:46.300]   Yeah, I feel like we should move on from TikTok videos to change log.
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.820]   Let me just mention the book.
[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:54.660]   The book is called "Settons" by Daniel Genes, G-E-N-I-S, a guy who from his drug habit,
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:56.300]   he was known, did we talk about this before?
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.300]   No.
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:05.460]   He was known as the plate bandit because he felt so bad robbing people.
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:08.220]   He apologized and apologized.
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:09.820]   And then he stopped doing it.
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:10.820]   He stopped stopping people.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:11.820]   Yeah.
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:13.180]   But he recognized him and got him.
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:20.460]   He was made an example of 10 years in New York State prison systems and he vowed to read
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:22.460]   a thousand books while he was in there.
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:24.820]   Oh, he read a lot of books.
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:25.820]   I remember this.
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.380]   He read a lot of books, which is kind of interesting, but he also talks about things
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:30.060]   like he was, he's Jewish.
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:33.460]   So we talked about all the people who converted because they wanted the kosher food.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.340]   He talked about how they made the food.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:37.660]   It's a fascinating book, actually.
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:44.700]   So if I go to prison, I should convert and I should bring paper bags with me.
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:45.700]   And a hairdryer.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:46.700]   And a hairdryer.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:48.620]   Do you think they have blow dryers in prison?
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:49.620]   I don't think so.
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.620]   No.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.620]   It's prison.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:52.620]   I feel like that's how you...
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:53.620]   That seems risky.
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:56.620]   All right, let's take a break and then I will...
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:58.820]   That was our take talk moment.
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:04.860]   I will fulfill a Stacy Wilder's streams with a Google change log.
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:12.220]   The Google change log.
[01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:13.780]   It's Google change log time.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:21.420]   Boy is it, girls, Google is adding a flyover like aerial view to maps.
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:22.420]   I thought we...
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.020]   Oh, but it's kind of cool.
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:25.020]   So you can...
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.540]   It's almost like your flight simulator kind of...
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.980]   Only a certain number of major landmarks.
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:35.700]   Here's the Empire State Building, the Elizabeth Tower featuring Big Ben.
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.700]   That's San Quentin.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.700]   That's cool.
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.380]   Elizabeth Tower, I never knew that.
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:43.780]   Yeah, because of Big Ben, but you tell that to a Londoner and say, "Oh, mate, that's
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:45.180]   the Elizabeth Tower.
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:48.100]   Big Ben's the bell."
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:49.100]   Just like that.
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:50.100]   Just like that.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.100]   I'm throwing him accent.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.100]   Sorry.
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.100]   Lucky Mary Poppins.
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:54.940]   No, that's my dick.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:57.500]   There was Alcatraz too, where you could make pizza.
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.500]   Yeah.
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:22:59.500]   No, I think that's the same.
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.500]   Oh, it's an Alcatraz.
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:01.500]   Alcatraz.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.300]   You can't make pizza at Alcatraz.
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:04.540]   They don't have riser anymore.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.540]   No, no hair dryers in Alcatraz.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.460]   Oh, okay.
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:18.780]   Google Photos, the website is starting to show the backup quality of every image.
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:19.780]   That's interesting.
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:20.780]   So it'll tell you...
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.460]   They didn't deal with your space too.
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:24.460]   To be a scientist.
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:25.820]   So it'll tell you...
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:29.540]   Let's hear some examples from 9 to 5 Google.
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:35.220]   You'll be able to see backed up.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:41.140]   This item doesn't take up space in your account storage because it's something.
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:42.140]   Then original quality.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.140]   So it doesn't tell you a lot.
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:47.220]   Here's one that says original quality 2.1 megabytes.
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:50.500]   You're going to get more information about what's in there.
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:56.380]   Actually, I noticed that already in my Google Photos because I put all of our trip pictures
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:57.980]   up there.
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:58.980]   So that's good.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:02.180]   You'll know how much Google storage do you buy?
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.500]   Two terabytes.
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:07.300]   And I have about 500 gigabytes of stuff there right now.
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:08.660]   It's starting to fill up.
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:09.660]   Wow.
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:10.660]   Well, put all my pictures there.
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:11.660]   I do.
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:14.860]   You ready for the new Google Play logo?
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:21.220]   You know, I feel like the worst of the Google Play is the logo.
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:22.380]   But well, okay.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.300]   Maybe this is the subsidiary story.
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:27.860]   It's the 10th anniversary of Google Play.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:29.900]   It's the ninth anniversary of Chromecast.
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:31.300]   I have a story about that.
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:32.300]   Nice.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.300]   Oh.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:38.500]   Google Play gets a new logo today to celebrate year 10.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:42.900]   I kind of find it hard to believe that it's only 10 years for Google Play.
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:43.900]   But that's the fact.
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:44.900]   Same.
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:46.580]   Seems a lot longer than that.
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:48.580]   Hangouts on Air is back as...
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:51.740]   This is a complicated story.
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:52.740]   Here we go.
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:59.060]   Air is back as Google Meet brings YouTube live streaming to free Gmail.
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.060]   Just what you always want.
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.060]   Who's on first?
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:04.220]   Why do I want a live stream from my Gmail?
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:07.220]   I don't know.
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:08.220]   But you can.
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:11.220]   Oh, here's what Google says.
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.220]   Live streaming is useful.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:16.300]   It's situations where you want to present information to large audiences outside of your
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:22.460]   organization, giving them the opportunity to pause and replay as needed or view the presentation
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:23.460]   at a later time.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:26.460]   Do you agree, chat room?
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:27.460]   I am.
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:28.460]   What else?
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:31.020]   That's what we...
[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:34.460]   Air quality alerts coming to your At-A-Glance widget.
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:37.660]   Let me look at my Pixel phone and see.
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:38.660]   That's nice.
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:39.660]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:42.180]   The At-A-Glance is that widget at the top of the screen.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:45.260]   Right now it's just showing me the temperature and the date.
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:46.260]   But I guess it's on point.
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:47.260]   It used to be on the frog.
[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:48.260]   Right.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.260]   The frog does that.
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:50.260]   Yeah.
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:51.260]   Yeah.
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:52.260]   I had it on my...
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:55.980]   I assume it'll look similar to my Nest Hub thing.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:58.740]   I have AQI on the hub as well.
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:25:59.740]   Yeah.
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:00.740]   That's right.
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:01.740]   It's right underneath the temperature.
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:02.740]   It's green.
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.100]   It says right now it's a 30 AQI, which is not great.
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.100]   That's wonderful.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:06.100]   No, that's good.
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:07.100]   Not great.
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:08.100]   Mine is usually like six.
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.100]   Oh, man.
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:10.100]   I'm moving there.
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:11.100]   Oh, that's amazing.
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.100]   I mean, unless it's wildfire season.
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:18.220]   We get routinely between 2030, I thought that was good.
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:20.620]   But I guess you're really out of the pollution zone.
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:21.620]   Yeah.
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:23.780]   Beautiful downtown Bainbridge Island.
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:26.620]   There was an otter in my backyard the other day.
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:27.620]   Whoa.
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.500]   You know what you ought to do?
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:30.500]   No.
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:33.260]   Never mind.
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:34.260]   There is a picture.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:37.500]   Here's a picture from 905 Google, what you're going to see.
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.980]   129 AQI, you definitely don't want that.
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:41.980]   That is not good.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:42.980]   Oh, my.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:43.980]   That's orange.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.180]   That means don't go out.
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:46.180]   Stay inside.
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:47.180]   Stay inside.
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:48.540]   I'm probably getting a lot of cured.
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:51.860]   Actually it means don't go outside and do exercise.
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:54.460]   If you're relatively healthy, you can't go outside.
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:57.220]   Well, it's something important to us here, especially in the summer when we get the
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:58.900]   wildfire season starts.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:01.020]   Sometimes we can have very poor quality.
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:02.860]   I actually mentioned this a couple of years ago.
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:08.300]   I got an indoor and outdoor purple sensor so that I could see what the indoor quality
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.780]   was and the outdoor quality was real quickly.
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:16.780]   Let me just, you know, now that you mentioned it, let's just check what it is.
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:24.700]   AQI, my sensor has been down for 97 days.
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:25.700]   What?
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:26.700]   Good lord.
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:29.820]   But the AQI outside is three.
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:30.820]   That's good.
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:32.220]   I stay back.
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:35.020]   The schools are down too apparently.
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:36.020]   It's zero.
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:38.220]   That can't be right.
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:41.100]   That's zero.
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:42.620]   What that can't be right.
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:46.740]   That's what happens when you have a decentralized citizen power network.
[01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:47.740]   What?
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:51.820]   Yeah, I think there's something wrong.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:52.980]   Oh, I know why this is down.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:56.340]   We got our house painted.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:57.340]   So I took it.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:00.020]   Oh, I thought it was.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:05.980]   Well, I just didn't want them to paint over the purple sensor.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:06.980]   That would get them.
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.980]   Because they will.
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:08.980]   They would.
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.420]   I have them slap some paint on that.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:12.580]   It'll measure as the house.
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:18.660]   Google Drive, Docs, and other workspace apps are getting optimized for.
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:19.660]   Any guesses?
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:20.660]   Chat.
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:21.660]   Hang on.
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:22.660]   Hang on.
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:23.660]   Any guesses?
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:26.420]   I love YouTube streaming.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:27.420]   Nope.
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:29.100]   Tablets.
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:31.500]   Android Tablets.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.380]   Android Tablets.
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:35.900]   Maybe Google is going to do a tablet.
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:39.940]   They remember at Google I/O they talked a lot about tablets.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:45.180]   And of course, as we've always said, the real flaw in Android Tablets is the lack of
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:46.900]   supporting software.
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:52.100]   So Google Drive will have multiple windows just like Chrome.
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:57.420]   You can drag and drop text and images from apps like Chrome and Sheets right into an existing
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:59.260]   document.
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:04.100]   Upload files by dragging and dropping them into the Google Drive app.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:08.180]   Keep will allow you to insert images again with drag and drop.
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:10.940]   That is much needed.
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:15.380]   And maybe this will transform the landscape for Android Tablets.
[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:16.620]   It's a good idea.
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:18.100]   Have some choices.
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.100]   Chrome.
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:22.700]   Again, with them, it's all about value.
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:30.580]   The low end cost with tablets is people that want a tablet, they usually want an iPad, right?
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:34.900]   If it's something that a utility-wise kind of thing, yeah, go in Android.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:37.180]   It's much cheaper.
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:39.180]   So, golly is explaining the-
[01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.980]   Speaking of Android, Ant, may I ask a question?
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:43.980]   Sure.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.820]   So, last week we had the major news you missed out on Leo.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:51.500]   And Ant had finally had it with his Pixel 6.
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:52.500]   What?
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:53.500]   What?
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:54.500]   And got a new one.
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.820]   And he had a box last week.
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:58.220]   I've been waiting for the verdict.
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:00.740]   Did you get a 6A or a 6 Pro?
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:04.980]   No, I replaced the 6 Pro.
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:05.980]   With another 6 Pro.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:06.980]   Totally fine.
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:07.980]   So, you had a bad one.
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:08.980]   Oh, yay!
[01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:09.980]   Totally fine.
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:10.980]   So, that's good.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:15.620]   I said some nice stuff about it and then that weekend, right after I said something nice,
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:19.060]   it totally went to crap and I requested it.
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:20.060]   The old one and-
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:21.060]   Good.
[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:22.060]   And they requested it.
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.260]   Without questions, they just said it.
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:25.980]   This was a lot of the hilarity last week.
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:31.380]   Because others of us might have had to go through five or six variations of calls and
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:32.380]   all kinds of-
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:33.380]   I did a classic-
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:35.500]   Diagnostic-sundly word it checked.
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.700]   The sternly worded ant-proot.
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:38.700]   Wow.
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:39.700]   Just got it done.
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:40.700]   What's your secret?
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:41.700]   What did you say?
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:42.700]   What's the magic words?
[01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:43.700]   Firmness.
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:44.700]   Firmness.
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:45.700]   Don't say please.
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:46.700]   Just say do it.
[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.700]   You didn't say so.
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:50.860]   And that's the hard lesson for me.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:52.900]   I'm like, I can't not say please.
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:53.900]   Please give me a nice, real-
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:54.900]   That's just real.
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:55.900]   Say please.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:56.900]   Or, I mean, like-
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:57.900]   Please, Google.
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:58.900]   I would like to-
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:30:59.900]   Hey, I have some more.
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:04.100]   Firmlances that you provide me with a new handset.
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:05.100]   Chromecast.
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:06.100]   Back to the other one yesterday.
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:07.100]   Good.
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:08.100]   Well, you know what?
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:09.100]   This is my item.
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:10.100]   This is your item.
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:11.100]   Nine years old.
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:12.500]   It's nine years old.
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:17.100]   And today they said that Chromecast is going to work with Google TV or Chromecast and Google
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:20.700]   TV is going to roll out support for live video streaming from your Nest K-
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:21.700]   Oh, good.
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:22.700]   Indoor.
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:23.700]   Out of the battery.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:24.700]   So you can report your neighbors.
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:25.700]   Yeah.
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:26.700]   And your Nest doorbell.
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:30.300]   So, yeah, they all will be supported and you can see live.
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:31.300]   He's from your camera.
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:32.300]   Whew.
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:34.100]   So I couldn't do that before.
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:35.100]   Okay.
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:37.300]   You actually, you could do it.
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:39.100]   No, you could do it on your Nest hubs.
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:42.860]   My hub does it automatically with somebody rings a doorbell that goes, "Someone's at the
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:45.500]   front door!" and then shows me a picture.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.500]   Right.
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.100]   Now you can do that on Chromecast.
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:49.100]   Sorry to hurt your ears.
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:51.100]   Kids, I didn't mean it.
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:52.100]   That's what it does to me.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.100]   It yells.
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:55.700]   It's the loudest thing in the house.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:32:00.100]   You're having like the hats gone, but every time I look at you or hear from you, I'm just
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:04.900]   like, "This guy, I don't know what drugs he's on, but I wish I were taking them."
[01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:07.500]   You think there's something going on, maybe?
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.500]   Does he have a fever?
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:13.300]   Does it hurt and have a temperature?
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:16.700]   Streaming live video from the new Nest cams in doorbell.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:17.900]   Okay, cool.
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:23.620]   That's the one they most recently came out with, which I have, which I really actually
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:24.620]   like a lot.
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:25.620]   It has a nice remote...
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.260]   Doorbell or the cam?
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:29.700]   The Chromecast with Google TV.
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:30.700]   Oh.
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:31.700]   It's not the old one.
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:32.700]   It's the new one.
[01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:33.700]   Right.
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:34.700]   And finally...
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:37.300]   Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:42.780]   Chromebooks are getting a new, more advanced Google Photos movie editor.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.260]   Yay.
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:46.580]   I can make more videos for Instagram.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:47.580]   Nice.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:49.340]   Heaven was really excited.
[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:50.340]   Nice.
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:52.180]   Yeah, the camera's right.
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:59.380]   So this is still just standard cutting and a few filters on top kind of thing.
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:01.660]   Yeah, but you never did it locally.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:04.660]   The problem was on a Chromebook, you don't edit it locally, you're writing it in the
[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:05.660]   cloud.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:06.660]   In the cloud.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:07.660]   Yeah.
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:12.660]   There's a service out there that I had picked one of the discuss on the show one day.
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:13.660]   What's it called?
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:14.660]   It's called Axle Edit.
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:15.660]   And it was all cloud-based.
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:16.660]   Yeah.
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:17.660]   Yeah.
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:18.660]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:23.660]   Did I mention that only you could prevent forest fires?
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:24.660]   Okay.
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:26.020]   Just checking.
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:30.660]   And that's the Google change log.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.660]   Vee-borish, lio.
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:34.660]   Vee-borish, lio.
[01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:35.660]   Vee-borish, lio.
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:36.660]   Boop-boop-boop-bo.
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:37.660]   D'noh-do.
[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:41.660]   Mr. Benito, I don't know if you're ready for this version of Mr. Lique.
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:42.660]   No.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:43.660]   If Eddie was sorry.
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:49.700]   They locked me in my office for good reason.
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:53.900]   Let's take a little, uh, well, wait, we just took a break before the change log so we can
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:55.300]   go a little longer.
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:34:04.300]   Um, couple of security stories, a new rootkit, uh, which is actually pretty serious.
[01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:09.700]   This is from ours, Technica Dan Gouden writing the discovery of a new UEFI rootkit exposes
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:12.380]   and ugly truth attacks are invisible to us.
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:16.420]   UEFI is the boot firmware.
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:22.220]   And if you put malware in there, it will persist even when you wipe the drive, reinstall
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:25.980]   windows, etc, etc, etc.
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:32.300]   This has been in the wild since stand back 2016.
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:35.380]   And that's bad news.
[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:40.540]   The firmware compromises the low level and highly opaque chain of firmware required to
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:43.380]   boot up nearly every modern computer.
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:46.340]   Um, wow, exotic.
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:47.340]   Yes.
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:48.580]   Dan writes rare.
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:49.580]   No.
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:52.620]   Kaspersky discovered this.
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:56.260]   And I'm sure Steve Gibson will talk a little bit more about this.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:01.720]   The most striking part of this Kaspersky writes is that the UEFI implants seems to have been
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:06.900]   used in the wild since the end of 2016 long before UEFI attacks started being publicly
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:08.540]   described.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:10.420]   This discovery begs a final question.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:17.580]   If this is what the attackers are using back then, what are they using now?
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:26.460]   Usually a nation state, it's a fairly sophisticated hack, which means probably you're okay unless
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:33.060]   you work for a three letter agency, you're a well known podcaster, that kind of thing.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:37.460]   Um, anyway, security, security time.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:38.860]   Watch out.
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:39.860]   Watch out.
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:42.300]   As long as we're, we'll talking about that.
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:51.220]   There was a bug in the, the coding of Intel's GPU that made them one, one, one, one hundred
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:55.740]   times as fast, a hundred times slower in ray tracing.
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:59.700]   And the only reason people noticed is because they pushed out an update and all of a sudden,
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:01.700]   whoa, what happened?
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:06.340]   My, my GPU's got a man got a hundred times faster.
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:09.100]   Well, that's not because they got a hundred times better.
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.420]   It's because they had a bug.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:13.220]   And a code was missing.
[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:14.220]   That's it.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:15.700]   A missing line of code.
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:18.460]   You know, that's how I approach all my jobs.
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:19.700]   I, I start out.
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:20.700]   It's one percent.
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:21.700]   Yeah.
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:25.940]   And then once I hit a hundred percent, they're like, what the heck?
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:26.940]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:27.940]   Whoo.
[01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:29.540]   Uh, justice for data janitors.
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:32.540]   This looks like a, uh, Jeff Jarvis story to me.
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:33.540]   It, it is.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:38.100]   And I think it's interesting angle here is that the, the people, you know, whether it's
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:46.300]   a social or whether it's more likely AI cleaning up data is going to be key to quality
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.620]   and credibility.
[01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:51.620]   And somebody has the dirty job to clean it up, literally clean it.
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:56.460]   So we're going to let an AI do that.
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:57.660]   But what do you mean cleaning?
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:00.260]   I understand what needs to be cleaned.
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:04.180]   When you have data, so like, let's take temperature data.
[01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:05.260]   They're cleaning up there.
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:06.260]   They're organizing it.
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:10.820]   So like if I have a sensor reporting temperature data, yeah, I got to make sure everybody I'm
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:14.060]   comparing to, they're all reporting Celsius or all reports.
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:19.780]   Oh, oh, so it's just not like sweeping up old data that's on the floor.
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:24.940]   Sanitizing sanitizing, but it, but it is what what they're saying here is there is a human
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:27.740]   role in going through this data stuff.
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:31.060]   And the people who do it are usually not employees of Google.
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.900]   They are contract workers.
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:38.340]   And the burden of AI's quality is upon them.
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:40.340]   And they're not treated fairly.
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:43.420]   Ah, the human few old automation.
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:47.220]   They never got invited to the parties is what you're saying.
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:48.220]   They don't get free lunch.
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:51.580]   No, they don't get free lunch health insurance or all these things.
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:53.340]   I mean, it's a good metadays.
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:56.460]   Well, we should union us.
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:00.980]   People think they, I mean, this goes back to this idea that engineers are the kings
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:03.380]   and everyone else is just there to support them.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.380]   Right.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:05.380]   Right.
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:09.700]   Are you upset about the loss of the Chaco Taco, Jeff Jarvis?
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:13.500]   I've never had one, but it feels like that's something you'd be upset about.
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.900]   It feels like something I should be mad about.
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:20.660]   And now it's maybe Alexa so heavy and that's hysterical.
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:23.300]   So I think I think he's serious.
[01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:24.540]   Oh, I'm sure he is.
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:25.900]   The guy's got a lot of money.
[01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:29.300]   He founded Reddit and now is married to Serena Williams.
[01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:30.300]   Serena.
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:36.060]   He says, "Dear Unilever," it's kind of gross when you think that Unilever makes the Chaco
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:37.060]   Taco Taco.
[01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:38.060]   Exactly.
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:39.060]   Exactly.
[01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:41.020]   I think they do it under a better brand name than that.
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:45.180]   What is the name of the ice cream company?
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:50.300]   They made and for many years sold in the ice cream truck, you knew and love as a child
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:54.500]   as they drive around playing the turkey and the straws theme song through the neighborhood.
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:39:01.900]   It's a ice cream sandwich that had a folded over ice cream cone with a chocolate sealant
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:05.580]   inside delicious melted something.
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:06.580]   Peanuts.
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:07.580]   Peanuts.
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:13.260]   And you'd take a bite and Chaco Taco Heaven, but apparently not enough people love the
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.260]   Chaco Taco.
[01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:15.260]   No, it's not that.
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:20.340]   The problem is, the problem says the company is that they just had to reduce the product
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:23.500]   line because it's so popular all over their place.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.660]   Oh, it's made by Klondike.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:29.820]   So they're going to focus on the Klondike bar or something else.
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:34.020]   Anyway, Alexis says, "I'd like to buy the rights to your Chaco Taco."
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:35.540]   What is he thinking, though?
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:39.540]   Maybe like a Chaco Taco pop-up store on Fifth Avenue?
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:43.980]   I think we finally get the Chaco truck on every corner.
[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:46.460]   Oh, they promised us that, didn't they?
[01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:47.460]   They did.
[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:48.460]   They did.
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:55.100]   And then somebody has posted a dolly image of, quote, Renaissance style painting of a Chaco
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.220]   Taco rising like a city.
[01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:00.940]   He promised that the logo would be made by dolly in the next week.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:03.340]   That's a pretty darn good logo.
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:05.820]   I'm loving it.
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:08.060]   Although what is that inside my Chaco Taco?
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:09.060]   Is that chocolate Phoenix?
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:10.540]   It looks like it's alive.
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:12.300]   I don't think that one works.
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:13.300]   What's the green?
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.300]   That doesn't work.
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:16.300]   Let's roll down.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:17.300]   That's so bad.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:19.300]   And makes those pretty good.
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:24.300]   He says, "100% of our future marketing artwork will be generated by AI.
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.220]   This delicious treat from our childhood.
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.900]   We'll see a new day where it will get the treatment it deserves."
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:33.060]   I feel like this is pulling an Elon Musk on the Chaco Taco crowd.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.060]   He's just pulling an internet.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:36.300]   No, I'm just going to call it pulling an internet.
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:38.860]   Nowadays, he's pulling an internet.
[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:43.140]   He wants to get all the bots out of the Chaco Taco.
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:53.820]   And he's willing to put his money where his mouth is.
[01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:59.420]   What about the story, the sad tragic tale of a seven-year-old whose finger was broken
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:02.540]   by a chess robot?
[01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:03.940]   Because he was moving too fast.
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.540]   Just a few minutes all over it.
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:08.460]   Yeah, I've been following this one.
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:11.860]   This was, of course, in Russia where they don't have the same OSHA standards for chess
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:14.180]   playing robots.
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:16.540]   There's a video, but I don't want to watch it.
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:17.540]   No, no, no.
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:19.820]   This robot has been other places.
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:21.940]   It's been many exhibitions for years.
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:25.340]   I thought even outside of Russia.
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:26.340]   Yeah.
[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:34.420]   Sergei Smagen, vice president of Russia Chess Federation, told the Basa Telegram channel,
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:40.780]   "Robot appeared to pounce after it took one of the boy's pieces rather than waiting for
[01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:42.140]   machine to complete move.
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:46.460]   Boy opted for a quick ripost.
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:51.980]   There are certain safety rules and child apparently violated them when he made his move.
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:54.980]   He did not realize he had first to wait.
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:57.140]   This is an extremely rare case.
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.500]   Wait a minute.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.060]   They're putting it on the child?
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:02.940]   They're saying the kid was moving too fast.
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:09.380]   And the robot grabbed him, held him for several seconds before people rushed to help and
[01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:13.740]   pulled the finger of the young player from the robot, but the fracture could not be
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:14.740]   avoided.
[01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:19.300]   I saw the video, but I didn't know they were going to go to the chess robot.
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.300]   B2.
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:21.300]   Really?
[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:22.300]   Literally.
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:24.260]   Well, I didn't know Stacey had an accent.
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:25.980]   Oh, very good Stacey.
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:27.740]   We need a Russia off here.
[01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:33.620]   By the way, child continued to play the very next day, finished the tournament.
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:40.420]   But parents have reportedly contacted the public prosecutor's office.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:49.140]   It could be the end of the line for robot.
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:51.820]   I think Stacey should do the next story in her accent.
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:52.820]   Okay.
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:53.820]   Okay.
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:56.140]   We could do the International Space Station.
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:58.180]   Stacey, over to you.
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.980]   Wait, where are we?
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:03.580]   Russia says, don't worry.
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:07.340]   They're going to keep the ISS alive, right?
[01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:08.340]   No.
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:10.820]   They're going to do their own ISS.
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:11.980]   No more international.
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:15.100]   Well, let's just space station.
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:16.580]   Russia's dropping out.
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:18.700]   They're going to take a couple of years.
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:21.860]   They're going to continue to fly astronauts up and down because they have an agreement
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:22.860]   to do so.
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:27.100]   But, and I'm sure we'll talk about this with Rod Pylon this week in space.
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:32.860]   But they said, and this is all due to pressure the US has put on Russia over the Ukraine
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:41.340]   situation, the invasion, the space, the US and ESA and Russia had announced that they
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:44.500]   were going to take the space station down.
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:47.900]   But, but now they're keeping it running.
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:51.660]   They had hoped to keep it running until 2030.
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:55.660]   Russia, by the way, the space agencies run by a political appointee.
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:59.220]   In this case, Yuri Bortasov, which is a great Russian name.
[01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:02.460]   What is Bortasov?
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:08.500]   He said during meeting with President Vladimir Putin, the decision to leave the station has
[01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:10.540]   been made.
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:15.940]   I think by that time we will start forming a Russian orbiting station, right?
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:16.940]   Vladimir.
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:20.460]   So, why not?
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:22.540]   It's been, you know, this has been a little bit of a problem.
[01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:29.820]   A couple of Russian astronauts were up there several weeks ago spouting pro-Russian anti-Ukrainian
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:30.820]   propaganda.
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:33.660]   So, this has been a little bit of a hot potato.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.180]   It went on a nice neighborhood these days.
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:37.260]   Not a good, it's going downhill.
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:38.260]   Yeah.
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:43.100]   And when you're stuck in space, you know, you really, there's not a lot of politics can't
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.100]   be.
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.100]   I think a lot of experts.
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:48.860]   It's bad to be on an elevator with a jerk, you know, imagine being in space for the world.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:53.420]   But a lot of experts, including Scott Kelly, who I think holds the record for the longest
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:59.140]   time aboard the ISS, agree that this is kind of political.
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:01.940]   It'd be more bluster than real.
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:04.980]   They said after 2024, well, that's kind of vague.
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:09.340]   So can we do the International Space Station without Russia?
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:10.340]   It's hard.
[01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:13.340]   A lot of those support launches come from...
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:14.340]   I come from...
[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:15.340]   Roscosmos.
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:16.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:18.700]   No, it's not Moscow, but Russia.
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:19.700]   Roscosmos.
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:21.620]   Roscosmos.
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:29.540]   The internet is not happy about the leap second.
[01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:31.540]   Do you know about the leap second?
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:32.540]   I do.
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:35.980]   I skimmed over this headline, so I can't wait to hear about this.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:37.980]   So it turns out...
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:39.820]   All this, and I was like, no.
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:41.860]   What are you, Leo?
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:49.380]   Turns out that the Earth is not as consistent as our atomic clocks, which are very accurate.
[01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:54.100]   But what they're measuring is, aren't they, is the amount of time it takes the Earth
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:57.740]   to rotate, the amount of time the Earth takes to revolve around the sun.
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:00.900]   That's a day and a year, respectively.
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:06.420]   And every once in a while, because the Earth isn't all that consistent, they have to add
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:08.980]   or subtract, I think, sometimes a second.
[01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:13.260]   Usually it's adding a leap second so that the clocks...
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:14.540]   They're changing the clocks.
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:15.540]   The Earth is right.
[01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:17.780]   The Earth is always right.
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:22.020]   And so that the clocks match the actual rotation of the Earth.
[01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:25.140]   It's like when we change the actual measurement of a kilogram.
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:26.140]   That's right.
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:27.140]   Remember?
[01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:28.140]   We just gone through several changes, right?
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:29.140]   Yeah.
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:32.300]   I remember seeing the official kilogram.
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:34.860]   I think it was kept in Paris for a long time.
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:37.740]   I don't know if you saw it when you were there, but they replaced it with some...
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:40.660]   Are you going to go back in the French accent now?
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:41.660]   I'm actually...
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.340]   It looks like I'm wearing Barney.
[01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:44.340]   I don't know what this is.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:45.340]   In the green hat.
[01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:46.340]   Yeah.
[01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:48.660]   It's so cool.
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:53.220]   I'm stuck in my office, and I have one of the things I have in my office is hundreds
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:55.500]   of hats.
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:47:01.060]   Since 1972, the world's timekeeping authorities have added a leap second 27 times to the
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:04.020]   international atomic time.
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:09.860]   The way they do it, you may remember this, at midnight on New Year's Eve, instead of
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:18.060]   going to 2359.59, they jump to 2359.60, and then to 000.
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:20.660]   But the computers...
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:22.460]   Think of the computers.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:25.500]   It screws the hell out of them.
[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:30.500]   It makes it because they're not set up to allow for this, and it's not predictable.
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:33.980]   That's part of the problem.
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:43.980]   So computer wizards, like research scientist Ahmed Bayagawi of Facebook parent company
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:52.140]   Meta, said we are predicting that if we don't modify the atomic clock, we should be good
[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:57.780]   for at least 2,000 years before it starts to be weird.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:02.300]   Maybe at that point we have to consider a kind of correction.
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:07.780]   By the way, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, and the French equivalent,
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:16.220]   BIPAM, Zebiro, Intonas yonada de Paudémezure, kind of agree, because they're the ones who
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:17.220]   have to do it.
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:19.820]   They're in charge of the global clock system.
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:25.660]   In 2012, the leap second change triggered a massive Reddit outage, according to CNET,
[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:30.740]   as well as related problems at Mozilla, LinkedIn, Yelp, and airline booking service Amadeus.
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:32.620]   Help me Amadeus!
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:41.740]   In 2017, a leap second glitch, a cloud flare, knocked out some network infrastructure servers.
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:45.940]   Cloudflare software, comparing two clocks, calculated the time had gone backwards.
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:51.100]   I couldn't figure out what to do as a result.
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:56.020]   We're going backwards!
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:49:02.900]   So this is a human thing humans do to make our clocks match to the planets.
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:04.940]   And not good.
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:06.940]   Not good.
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:07.940]   Google has an idea.
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:09.580]   Of course.
[01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:12.140]   Google has a fix.
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:16.460]   They call it the leap smear.
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:17.460]   Not the smear?
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:19.980]   You go leap smear.
[01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:26.260]   It makes the leap second changes in many tiny steps over the course of a day.
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:28.260]   So instead of a whole second...
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.740]   You're taking nanoseconds.
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:31.460]   You're taking out nanoseconds.
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:33.900]   Still problematic.
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:46.540]   That this is a post from Google, the Google blog in 2011 talking about the leap smear.
[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:47.940]   You know, who would have thought it?
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:52.220]   But of course, if you think about it, yeah, having the clocks arbitrarily at a second
[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:55.140]   every once in a while is very confusing.
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:57.860]   If you're a computer.
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:58.860]   Yeah.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:03.500]   Usually when the leap second is almost due to the NTP protocol, the time server protocol,
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:09.300]   says a server must indicate this to its clients by setting the leap indicator field in its
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:10.580]   response.
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:17.020]   This is saying, you know, the last minute of the day I'll have 61 seconds or 59 seconds.
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:20.820]   In theory, although not in practice, leap seconds can go backwards as well as forward.
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:25.540]   So when they designed the NTP protocol, they added that capability.
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:30.700]   So instead, Google says we applied a patch to the NTP server software on an internal
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:38.500]   servers not to set a leap indicator, but to tell a small lie about the time modulating
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:39.500]   this lie.
[01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:41.180]   Oh, now it's getting bad.
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:45.980]   You know, you tell one lie and then suddenly you got to tell a lot more.
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:47.860]   You can't count election balance.
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:52.060]   Yeah, pretty soon, you know, the election was fixed.
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:55.020]   What this did was make sure the lie we were telling our servers about the time wouldn't
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:57.100]   trigger any undesirable behavior.
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:51:04.180]   So I guess Google's been, been doing this for a while.
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:09.220]   In the ex, well, though, maybe they just tried it in this experiment, we performed two smears,
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:13.580]   one negative and then one positive and tested using about 10,000 servers.
[01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:15.460]   It worked.
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:16.460]   Oh, no.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:21.660]   So they have been doing this ever since the leap smear goes up to up to speed.
[01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:27.420]   I think Google says everybody should just do a leap smear instead of a leap year.
[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:30.340]   Happy leap smear.
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:34.700]   Oh, I love the almost sounds.
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:36.140]   I'm so made up, man.
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:37.140]   It does.
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:38.140]   It's serious.
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:44.140]   To the fact like new technology drives makes us deliberate, makes us develop more precision
[01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:45.140]   about our world.
[01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:49.580]   So think about like the railroads were the reason why we had to figure out time zones,
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:50.580]   right?
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:51.580]   Time zones, yeah.
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:57.260]   And so if you think about, you know, that because we're computing everything, we just
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:52:01.180]   have to figure out even more granular measures of how to tell time.
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:02.660]   And so it's kind of cool.
[01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:03.660]   True.
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:04.660]   Until we blow everything up.
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:05.660]   Yeah.
[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:06.660]   Yeah.
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:15.100]   So the kibble balance, which is used to measure the kilogram.
[01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:17.780]   Oh, but they stopped that.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:19.700]   Now it's just a price constant.
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:20.700]   Right.
[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:21.700]   Yeah.
[01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:24.980]   But it was, and I couldn't have seen plank like the business.
[01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:26.980]   Max, Mr. Max Planck's Max.
[01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:27.980]   Max to his friends.
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:35.740]   So there was, there used to be a cylinder of platinum iridium, which was the standard
[01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:37.100]   triple locked in a vault though.
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:39.100]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:42.900]   It was the standard or main zone till 2019.
[01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:45.780]   And then they used physics instead.
[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:47.180]   This you want to see the old one?
[01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:48.180]   You could go see it.
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:49.580]   I think you can go see it in France now.
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:51.060]   This is the old.
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:56.300]   And notice they seal it because you don't want any, any palladium to come off of it,
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:53:00.420]   decay off it, the international prototype of the kilogram.
[01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:04.380]   I guess once in a while they take it out and measure it or something, right?
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:05.380]   Yeah.
[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:09.660]   You could use that to tell time actually based on its level and amount of decay.
[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:14.300]   Oh, you are very sophisticated.
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:15.300]   You schmear the kilogram.
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:18.100]   You're bringing it a kill again.
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:22.860]   I have you used be real?
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:23.860]   You want to talk about it?
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:24.860]   You care?
[01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:26.860]   You talked about last week, didn't you?
[01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:28.460]   I talked about it Sunday.
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:29.460]   Sunday.
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:30.460]   Oh, on Twitter.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:31.460]   That's right.
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:32.460]   That's right.
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:33.460]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:35.180]   I saw that.
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:36.180]   I keep missing.
[01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:42.980]   This is the new social app where you only take a picture when you get a notification.
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:46.420]   Okay, it's time and I keep missing my time.
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:48.700]   I notice you do two, Ant.
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:49.700]   And so you...
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:50.700]   I do.
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:52.540]   Yeah, because it says he was one minute late.
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:53.620]   Oh, okay.
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:56.860]   Because I'm thinking, "Dang, I thought I did."
[01:53:56.860 --> 01:53:58.580]   Well, maybe not today.
[01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:01.660]   I did one yesterday with six minutes late.
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:05.260]   So the idea is when the thing goes, you take a picture, it uses your front camera and your
[01:54:05.260 --> 01:54:06.660]   back camera.
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:07.660]   You could show...
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:08.660]   Can you show this, John?
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:09.980]   It's my over the shoulder shot.
[01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:11.420]   You get the front camera and the back camera.
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:13.260]   Here's Mike Yelgin.
[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:17.980]   And so it gets a selfie and then what you're doing.
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:18.980]   You can't...
[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:21.700]   Mike's doing this all about just perfectly.
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:22.700]   You would.
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:23.700]   John, can you...
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:26.220]   He has a very interesting life though.
[01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:27.220]   The rest of it is...
[01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:28.220]   Oh, you don't have a job.
[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:29.220]   I'm just in.
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:30.220]   Oh, there we go.
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:31.220]   Here's Ant.
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:32.220]   It's here.
[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:33.220]   Is he one minute late?
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:34.220]   See?
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:35.380]   It's Taddles on you.
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:36.740]   The Taddles on you.
[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:37.740]   No, he was just on...
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:39.780]   He was a leap second ahead.
[01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:40.780]   Oh, that's it.
[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:41.780]   He's a sheer...
[01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:42.780]   Just leaped me off.
[01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:43.780]   He's beating him early.
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:45.340]   Mike Yelgin's in jail now.
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:46.340]   So that's kind of interesting.
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:47.340]   Oh, look at that.
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:48.340]   Yeah.
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:50.660]   So those are my friends.
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:53.060]   And then you can also see what other people are doing.
[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:54.060]   You can discuss the people on this.
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:56.980]   The idea is to eliminate the FOMO, right?
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:55:00.940]   Because you see how crappy people's real lives are, except that that's, of course, not
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:01.940]   what happens.
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:05.220]   You just get people who are very good at making their lives.
[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:07.180]   You just hang around in the palace all day.
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:08.180]   Yes.
[01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:09.180]   I'm here in the panelists.
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:10.180]   I don't know.
[01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:11.180]   I don't know if this is going to go anywhere.
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:12.180]   And some of these look pretty crappy.
[01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:14.180]   Yeah, some of them are bad.
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:15.180]   I'm enjoying it.
[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:16.180]   Yeah.
[01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:17.180]   But it'd be fun for your friends.
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:18.180]   It's real.
[01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:22.780]   Like, it would be nice to be with your friends and see like, oh...
[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:23.780]   Yeah.
[01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:24.780]   So you can follow me.
[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:25.780]   It's really un-be-real.
[01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:26.780]   Amplifying...
[01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:29.420]   Really amplifying how boring my life is.
[01:55:29.420 --> 01:55:30.420]   Yeah.
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:33.420]   Jason just posted 27 hours late, Jason.
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:35.420]   He's always loved that.
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:38.420]   I mean, he's trying to help you out, man.
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:40.940]   He's doing the rundown right there.
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:41.940]   Saying, "Where's Leo?"
[01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:42.940]   I don't understand what he's showing.
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:44.860]   What are you talking about?
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:46.500]   So that's a good thing you can comment on.
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:47.500]   You can...
[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:51.860]   I'll give you a little thumbs up on your real emoji.
[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:53.260]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:55.300]   Yeah, you can do live.
[01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:57.300]   Oh, I have to do a real thumbs up.
[01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:58.300]   Oh, okay.
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:55:59.300]   Yeah.
[01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:00.300]   What are you talking about?
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:01.300]   You're a Trump.
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:04.740]   I know he's ruined the thumbs up, hasn't he?
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:05.940]   He's ruined the thumbs up.
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:06.940]   Yeah.
[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:08.740]   So I put a real thumb up on there.
[01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:10.220]   I'll do that for Mike.
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:11.220]   Or maybe I'll do it for Mike.
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:12.220]   I had someone...
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:13.220]   I think it was on Twitter.
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:15.860]   Wait, I want you to do the laughing, crying laughing.
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:16.860]   Crying laughing.
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:17.860]   Oh, it's a funny one, okay.
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:18.860]   Yeah, dude.
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:22.860]   Someone gets some onions.
[01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:24.420]   Oh, man.
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:29.420]   Oh, man.
[01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:30.420]   Anyway, be real.
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:31.420]   I don't know.
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:32.420]   You know what?
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:34.500]   Every five minutes somebody comes up with the next big thing in social.
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:36.580]   Yeah, there's always an effort.
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:38.420]   Yeah, I'm glad there's an effort.
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:39.420]   There's fun.
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.420]   Yeah.
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:45.660]   Someone on Twitter mentioned, you know, they don't like the fact that it uses both cameras.
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:48.500]   It uses their selfie camera in addition to their rear camera.
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:53.780]   And I'm thinking, well, why is it because you're shy or what?
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:59.740]   There is a potential for revealing things you didn't wish to reveal.
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:02.940]   There's some privacy possible privacy issues.
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:05.940]   Because your camera is getting...
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:09.140]   Yeah, you're not controlling exactly the...
[01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:10.140]   So you really...
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:11.140]   It doesn't post right away.
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:12.140]   You get to review it.
[01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:14.100]   But I still think things might leak through.
[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:15.100]   So I understand.
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:16.100]   I understand.
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:18.100]   But I want to take the picture.
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:19.100]   But I want to take the picture.
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:22.780]   It's not necessarily being all about the numbers.
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:23.780]   I agree.
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:26.780]   It's starting out the way like Path did.
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:28.780]   Yeah, I loved Paths.
[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:30.020]   Again, how long will that last?
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:34.780]   Yeah, I was sad that they sold Paths and it died.
[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:45.540]   Google has surprised the world with a bid for NFL Sunday ticket.
[01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:53.220]   This is a... these are very expensive rights to Sunday games out of market games.
[01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:54.620]   Direct TV has them right now.
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:58:00.740]   The NFL wants to sell it for more than two and a half billion dollars a year.
[01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:01.740]   It was widely...
[01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:04.020]   I thought that was supposed to be over in June.
[01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:08.020]   It was widely rumored that Apple got it, right?
[01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:13.460]   Because this is the problem is that broadcast networks can no longer compete with big text
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:14.460]   deep pockets.
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:15.460]   Of course.
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:21.700]   So Apple, Amazon, Google, all trying to get into sports.
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:24.820]   And the Sunday ticket is the prime package.
[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:27.340]   Although I suspect there will be others.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:29.220]   Formula One is coming on strong in the US.
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:31.620]   That would be a good one to get.
[01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:34.260]   Right now ESPN has the rights to that.
[01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:38.900]   So it was thought that Apple had kind of outbid everybody else.
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:43.860]   Google with a last minute bid from YouTube for the rights.
[01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:46.180]   This would happen next year in 2023.
[01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:49.740]   Apple's got to be grinding their teeth.
[01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:53.460]   Sports accounts for 95% of the most viewed programs on TV.
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:54.460]   It's very important.
[01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:55.460]   Bob, I...
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:59:00.020]   I wonder what it was before TV got sucky though.
[01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:04.540]   I mean, like today it could make that stat.
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:10.180]   I have been a former TV critic, as you all know.
[01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:12.380]   A TV guy.
[01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:15.380]   TV critic.
[01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:19.700]   For the first time in ages, just decided the other night to see what's on ABC, NBC, CBS,
[01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:21.220]   Oh my Lord.
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:22.220]   What track?
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:23.220]   Yeah.
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:24.220]   No, it's...
[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:25.220]   What's happening?
[01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:29.220]   Not only that, Trek interrupted by, you know, eight minute commercial chunks.
[01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:30.220]   Oh, well.
[01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:31.420]   So there's no continuity.
[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:32.620]   I mean, it's very hard.
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:37.660]   We've been spoiled, frankly, by the fact that we can watch stuff on Netflix and HBO Max
[01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:39.420]   and Hulu and so forth.
[01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:46.180]   And last week, Ant schooled me because I was complaining that I have HBO and Showtime and
[01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:50.140]   I only watched one show on each and he said, "Well, get rid of them, Jarvis, until you
[01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:51.140]   come back."
[01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:52.140]   I thought that.
[01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:53.740]   Oh, yeah, I forgot how to do it.
[01:59:53.740 --> 02:00:00.380]   Now the interesting thing is this is probably just an interim thing because ultimately, NFL
[02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:04.140]   probably wants to do the streaming themselves and own home rights.
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:07.220]   Although it's hard to turn down two and a half billion a year for some...
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:08.220]   I don't know what to do.
[02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:09.220]   Look at they not own it.
[02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:12.060]   I mean, MLB has their own app, NHL does.
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:14.900]   NFL announced their new app this week.
[02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:15.900]   So they are.
[02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:16.900]   That's ridiculous.
[02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:18.700]   It's hard to turn away that.
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:22.300]   It's hard to turn away that pack of money, right?
[02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:23.300]   That's a lot of money.
[02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:24.300]   I mean, that is...
[02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:30.660]   My husband, although he waits until playoffs for the NHL one, but he does pay like $300
[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:32.100]   in the MLB one.
[02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:33.100]   Yeah.
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:37.740]   And how much do people pay to watch Clemson football nationwide?
[02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:42.620]   Well, Clemson doesn't have anything like that because it's the NCAA.
[02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:43.740]   Oh, that's interesting.
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:50.100]   There are colleges that stream and make a lot of money to their boosters.
[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:54.860]   They're out of state boosters because there's people all over the country who care.
[02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:59.460]   Yeah, right now we just have the ACC network and people buy that package.
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:00.460]   Interesting.
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:01.780]   Just in conjunction with their cable package.
[02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:04.460]   Would you get all your Clemson games?
[02:01:04.460 --> 02:01:05.460]   Is that what you do?
[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:06.460]   Yeah, I see them now.
[02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:08.860]   I see everything now without a problem.
[02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:11.740]   And I love it.
[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:15.740]   Gosh, I love it.
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:26.020]   And this just in from JT in our Discord chat, a Google employee is going to get a surprise
[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:28.780]   tonight on CBS's Big Brother.
[02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:34.340]   I guess there's a Googler and Big Brother.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:35.340]   And it is not...
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:36.340]   Can I just say?
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:37.340]   It's not going to be good.
[02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:38.340]   Is it a pink swag?
[02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:40.340]   I can't believe that Google...
[02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:41.340]   Is it Blake Lamoyne?
[02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:43.340]   You wouldn't be funny.
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:44.340]   Right.
[02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:45.340]   Right.
[02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:46.340]   Put him in the big swag.
[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:48.860]   I can't believe Google comms would allow that.
[02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:49.860]   I just can't believe it.
[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:50.860]   I know.
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:58.860]   Well, Renee Ritchie, who was one of the regulars on Mac Break Weekly, took a job.
[02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:00.740]   We couldn't tell anybody where he went.
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:03.220]   He couldn't tell anybody where he went until comms approved.
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:05.700]   It turned out he took a job at YouTube.
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:07.780]   And I had no idea because he couldn't say.
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:09.460]   We just found out a couple of days ago.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:14.020]   He's going to be their creator liaison on YouTube, which is a good job.
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:15.860]   Anyway, we'll see what happens.
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:22.620]   Apple, according to the New York Times, has the inside track for the NFL Red Zone...
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:26.380]   Or I'm sorry, Sunday Ticket, Red Zone is different.
[02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:27.380]   Sunday Ticket.
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:28.380]   Yeah.
[02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:33.580]   Amazon, ESPN Plus, YouTube, All in the Hunt.
[02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:37.860]   This was delayed, apparently, because there were negotiations over a concurrent sale of
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:43.340]   NFL media assets, including Red Zone, NFL Network, and NFL Plus, which is a new subscription
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:47.020]   service that provides access to live games on mobile only.
[02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:49.340]   I think it's a big crack.
[02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:50.340]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:51.500]   You want the big screen.
[02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:53.980]   You want to see it on the big screen.
[02:02:53.980 --> 02:02:55.900]   All right.
[02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:59.780]   I think we're good.
[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:01.180]   I think we should move on.
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:02.180]   Anything that I missed.
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:04.220]   Oh, I did miss a big one.
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:05.380]   Holy crumb and I'm late.
[02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:06.980]   Did you talk about this?
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:09.260]   Amazon buying one medical?
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:10.260]   We did not talk about it.
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:11.260]   Holy moly.
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:12.260]   Holy moly.
[02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:16.260]   Because it's not a Google story.
[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:18.180]   Oh, come on.
[02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:20.220]   Oh, it's a big story.
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:21.220]   So Amazon...
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:22.220]   It's a big story, but...
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:27.540]   Amazon created their own kind of healthcare solution, which they said, "Oh, no, no, where
[02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:29.820]   it's just for our employees."
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:37.060]   Now with a $3.9 billion acquisition of a primary care provider, one medical, I think
[02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:38.060]   it's pretty clear.
[02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:42.900]   They bought pill packs, so they have Amazon pharmacy, a sponsor.
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:43.900]   They have...
[02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:46.020]   I mean, this is a big deal.
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:47.220]   If they could fix...
[02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:48.340]   Do somebody to fix healthcare?
[02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:49.340]   I'll allow you.
[02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:53.380]   Would they fix it or would they just make it expensive or worse?
[02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:54.380]   No, I think...
[02:03:54.380 --> 02:04:01.660]   I'm in a practice here on the largest one on the east coast, and it's a factory now.
[02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:02.660]   It's just awful.
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:03.660]   You can't get anything...
[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:06.020]   That's what they've all turned into.
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:08.220]   Totally what they've all turned into.
[02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:11.740]   And that's the insurance problem, right?
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:15.820]   Insurance is cutting back on the amount of money that they can collect.
[02:04:15.820 --> 02:04:18.340]   So scale, scale hits everything?
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:19.340]   Yeah.
[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:25.780]   In fact, because of that, I've considered, as a lot of people with deep pockets have,
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:31.820]   maybe paying out of pocket for concierge medical, and I was told, "Oh, one medical's
[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:33.940]   the one."
[02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:35.420]   They're out of San Francisco.
[02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:40.460]   They're in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, L.A., New York, Washington, D.C.
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:41.460]   They're a...
[02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:45.500]   This is according to the Washington Post, a subscription-based primary care provider that
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:51.220]   leans into technology to build what it calls, "a seamless combination of in-person, digital
[02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:58.140]   and virtual care services that are convenient to where people workshop and live."
[02:04:58.140 --> 02:04:59.140]   You pay a...
[02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:01.100]   This is most insurance is accepted.
[02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:04.780]   Well, but you pay an additional fee, an annual fee of $199.
[02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:06.700]   Oh, well.
[02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:10.220]   Which isn't bad.
[02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:11.900]   I think we're rapidly headed...
[02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:13.820]   I mean, we got a mess.
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:17.420]   This is privilege also coming into the rich people.
[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:18.420]   So that's the question.
[02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:19.420]   Does Amazon...
[02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:21.220]   Amazon is a...
[02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:26.700]   For profitingity, they're not interested in making healthcare more universal, more affordable.
[02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:27.700]   They're interested...
[02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:30.500]   They might be interested in making it more accessible to their workers.
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:31.500]   It big.
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:32.500]   Yep.
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:36.540]   In a way that might be kind of coercive, or you would worry that could be coercive.
[02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:39.700]   Instead of a union is what you're saying.
[02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:46.700]   Whether instead of a union or get treated by our doctors, but their doctors may be interested
[02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:51.940]   if you've got an RSI from working at the Amazon warehouse, maybe they're like, "Do this?
[02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:52.940]   Yes.
[02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:57.020]   We have all this data on how to improve this.
[02:05:57.020 --> 02:05:58.020]   Do this first.
[02:05:58.020 --> 02:06:01.780]   And then if that doesn't work, maybe they fire you and then you lose your healthcare.
[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:03.340]   I don't know.
[02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:07.300]   Amazon also though, has kind of acted like it wants to get into the healthcare business.
[02:06:07.300 --> 02:06:12.500]   It built Amazon Care, which was, as I said, initially for employees only.
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:13.860]   They bought health navigator.
[02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:17.100]   They bought pill pack.
[02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:20.340]   And now, one medical, I feel like they may...
[02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:22.180]   Yeah, they may have an interest in the space.
[02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:23.180]   It may be more than just employees, right?
[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:24.180]   But maybe not.
[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:26.180]   But no, they have a total interest in this space.
[02:06:26.180 --> 02:06:28.580]   One, because they're a huge employer.
[02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:32.820]   But two, I don't think they're like...
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:38.700]   The US healthcare system allows middlemen to profit exorbitantly.
[02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:41.980]   And it would be silly not to take advantage of that.
[02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:45.180]   The king of the middlemen, Amazon, right?
[02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:46.180]   Yeah.
[02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:51.060]   It says here, "We're an employee benefit for 8,000 companies, including Airbnb, Allbirds,
[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:52.900]   Nasdaq and Google."
[02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:53.900]   Oh, interesting.
[02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:58.100]   Wouldn't it be funny if Amazon ran Google's healthcare?
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:06:59.740]   A lot of information in there.
[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:00.740]   What does HIPAA protect?
[02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:05.940]   I mean, if you own one medical, do you have access to the medical information of all
[02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:08.180]   the customers?
[02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:09.580]   On an individual basis?
[02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:10.740]   I don't think so.
[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:12.780]   No, I mean, aren't you protected there?
[02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:13.780]   As it is, yeah.
[02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:14.780]   I would hope.
[02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:18.420]   You obviously don't have the data because you're serving the people, but what you do
[02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:20.220]   with it is the question.
[02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:21.220]   Yeah.
[02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:26.940]   Well, you would have data like X number, like, and it could be de-anonymized, kind of like,
[02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:32.580]   you would have like X percentage of people have this kind of cost associated, have C sections
[02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:33.580]   every year.
[02:07:33.580 --> 02:07:39.340]   So in your practice, you've got 20 C sections.
[02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:46.780]   The rarer your treatment, the more likely you are to be de-anonymized, right?
[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:47.780]   Final story.
[02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:48.780]   It is for rich folks.
[02:07:48.780 --> 02:07:49.780]   New York City.
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:50.780]   Yeah.
[02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:53.780]   Oh, a lot of concierge physicians, right?
[02:07:53.780 --> 02:07:54.940]   Yeah.
[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:56.420]   Yeah.
[02:07:56.420 --> 02:08:04.180]   Final story, we now know the reason all that luggage is being lost, it's black suitcases.
[02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:11.620]   If you just didn't have a black suitcase, the head of the Frankfort Airport, one of the
[02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:19.380]   biggest hub airports in the world, according to the Guardian, Stefan Schulte, advised passengers,
[02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:24.780]   hand carryover longings when possible and use suitcases that are easy to spot.
[02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:29.500]   Black suitcases are so common, it's hard to distinguish them from each other, he told
[02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:30.600]   the Guardian.
[02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:35.820]   Many people travel with black suitcases on wheels, which makes identifying them very
[02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:39.260]   time intensive.
[02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:43.700]   Not the fact that you fired 4,000 people during the pandemic and you haven't been able to
[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:46.060]   rehire more than a quarter of that.
[02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:47.220]   Not that.
[02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:50.420]   Not staff shortages.
[02:08:50.420 --> 02:08:53.420]   Black suitcases.
[02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:56.740]   Do you stay see what color is your luggage?
[02:08:56.740 --> 02:08:58.260]   I have a gold suit.
[02:08:58.260 --> 02:08:59.740]   Uh huh, I knew you did.
[02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:00.740]   And a pink suitcase.
[02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:01.740]   Yep.
[02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:02.740]   In a green suitcase.
[02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:04.500]   But my husband has two black suitcases.
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:05.500]   Yeah, me too.
[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:09.700]   And he gets really offended when I suggest he carry one of mine.
[02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:16.260]   There are companies that sell accoutrement for suitcases so you can easily distinguish
[02:09:16.260 --> 02:09:17.700]   your black suitcase.
[02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:19.500]   Maybe that's what you should do for your house.
[02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:24.820]   I tell you how many stupid black suitcases with bright rainbow ribbons I saw in the Paris
[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:25.820]   airport.
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:27.900]   I was like, come on, yo.
[02:09:27.900 --> 02:09:29.900]   It's hysterical.
[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:37.700]   You can get luggage straps that you put around them that would then, you know, have.
[02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:41.540]   Right, so United gave those to, to, uh, global services, people like me.
[02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:42.940]   So you had a whole bunch of people.
[02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:43.940]   Oh, great.
[02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:45.860]   The exact same yellow thing around the hill.
[02:09:45.860 --> 02:09:49.220]   No, that defeats the entire purpose.
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:55.460]   There was a company, uh, making luggage straps with like, witticisms on there.
[02:09:55.460 --> 02:10:00.620]   Like get your hands off my freaking luggage and stuff like that.
[02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:06.700]   Uh, I remember when it was time for us to get luggage, um, again, and I kept telling everybody,
[02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:10.620]   you don't spend a lot of money on luggage because it's just going to get the crap beat
[02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:11.620]   out of it.
[02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:12.620]   Yes.
[02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:15.740]   And then you want to make it nice and colorful and bright so you can see it.
[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:16.740]   Yeah.
[02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:18.140]   And it works like a job.
[02:10:18.140 --> 02:10:20.620]   And then you're sending it to button there where it's like a ton.
[02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:26.500]   I will, uh, Johnny Jett did a whole thing on KTLA on, uh, with the rich tomorrow, how
[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:30.260]   not to lose your luggage.
[02:10:30.260 --> 02:10:31.740]   I guess I can play this.
[02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:32.740]   It's just a little clip.
[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:34.020]   Doesn't happen to you.
[02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:38.220]   Our friend rich, rich, tomorrow, rich, Johnny Jett.
[02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:39.220]   Travel is bad.
[02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:40.220]   Yeah.
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:42.140]   And Johnny said, I don't know.
[02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:43.540]   I don't know what he said.
[02:10:43.540 --> 02:10:44.540]   Said don't wear it.
[02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:46.580]   Don't carry black luggage.
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:48.580]   That's a bad idea.
[02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:50.980]   That's all I have is black bags.
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:51.980]   Nope.
[02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:54.380]   Bright orange, bright red in the pruit.
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:55.380]   Oh, you have Clemson.
[02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:57.820]   Oh, this is a whole Clemson bags.
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:10:58.820]   What do you carry?
[02:10:58.820 --> 02:10:59.820]   Jeff, you travel a lot.
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:00.820]   You're used to anyway.
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:06.260]   I, uh, well, for one thing, none of this is my problem because I always carry on.
[02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:08.060]   Never check.
[02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:09.060]   Yeah.
[02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:12.020]   Pure amateur, amateur's, amateur's check.
[02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:13.020]   Yeah.
[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:14.020]   That's true.
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:15.020]   I have done 14 days.
[02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:17.340]   No, this is a carry on.
[02:11:17.340 --> 02:11:18.340]   Amateurs and women.
[02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:19.340]   This is your privilege.
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:20.340]   Right here.
[02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:21.340]   Right here.
[02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:22.340]   Right here.
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:23.340]   Right here.
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:24.340]   Right here.
[02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:25.340]   You cannot do that if you are a woman.
[02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:27.380]   If I wear the same outfit, so.
[02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:28.380]   Not a log.
[02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:29.380]   Yep.
[02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:30.380]   Yep.
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:33.260]   I can, I have check bags for like, or sorry, not check bags.
[02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:34.260]   I don't like checking bags.
[02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:35.720]   I don't do it very often.
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:42.060]   But also when you're traveling with a child, you have to check a bag because the child.
[02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:43.060]   That's true.
[02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:44.780]   In fact, Johnny Jett, who was the king of Never Check.
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:48.780]   He said exactly that because they had, they have not two kids.
[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:49.780]   And he had a big diaper.
[02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:51.380]   So check your prices.
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:52.380]   I always check.
[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:56.820]   I mean, if my shoes are a problem, I take more than one pair of shoes.
[02:11:56.820 --> 02:11:57.820]   Do you not?
[02:11:57.820 --> 02:11:59.820]   Oh, geez.
[02:11:59.820 --> 02:12:00.820]   What's this?
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:03.740]   Jeff's looking like a schlub over here.
[02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:08.900]   He's just like, I have 20 of these black t-shirts.
[02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:10.700]   I have black boss jeans.
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:11.700]   Yeah.
[02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:15.020]   I have black underwear socks if you must know.
[02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:16.020]   And that's what I found.
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:21.060]   Again, but, and, and, and I'm from a clothing standpoint, I get that I'm fairly simple,
[02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:25.500]   but my shoes typically don't fit in to carry on stuff because I'd like to take at least
[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:29.540]   two pairs of sneakers or shoes with me just to rotate.
[02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:31.180]   That's a smart man.
[02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:32.860]   Always rotate your footwear.
[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:33.860]   Yeah.
[02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:34.860]   He's smart.
[02:12:34.860 --> 02:12:36.900]   Yeah, I have to check.
[02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:38.420]   All right.
[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:39.420]   Check this.
[02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:44.140]   Team coming up our picks of the week.
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:45.580]   Let's kick off the picks of the week.
[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:48.100]   This week was Stacy's thing.
[02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:49.100]   What's your thing?
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:51.940]   A thing is actually a TikTok account.
[02:12:51.940 --> 02:12:53.940]   No, no, no.
[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:54.940]   Yes.
[02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:55.940]   All right.
[02:12:55.940 --> 02:13:00.500]   Here's my, here's my, it's sec engineer.
[02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:05.180]   It's a security engineer who's on TikTok who does IOT smart home stuff.
[02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:06.180]   Oh, cool.
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:08.060]   I don't know if you want to pull them up.
[02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:09.060]   Yeah.
[02:13:09.060 --> 02:13:10.060]   I'm right here.
[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:14.260]   Should I, should I, oh, I have to verify my puzzle piece.
[02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:15.260]   You're a robot.
[02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:16.260]   So stupid.
[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:17.260]   Next job puzzle piece.
[02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:18.260]   Next job puzzle piece.
[02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:20.100]   So I won't play the audio.
[02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:21.100]   Don't use anti-virus.
[02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:22.100]   Yeah.
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:26.140]   Go to a, go to one with the device because he does, and I think he might work for Trent
[02:13:26.140 --> 02:13:27.300]   and my co, my girl.
[02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:28.300]   So that's really, don't.
[02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:30.300]   Oh, so there's a little plug for AV.
[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:31.940]   Oh, look at these.
[02:13:31.940 --> 02:13:32.940]   Yeah.
[02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:33.940]   And this is not the security stuff.
[02:13:33.940 --> 02:13:36.500]   Those are for quiet keyboards, but.
[02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:37.500]   Oh, yeah.
[02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:38.500]   Who was that?
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:39.500]   Hope, swing.
[02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:42.180]   That was somebody who looked very unhappy.
[02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:45.780]   Leo, Leo, what's going on in your TikTok page?
[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:48.740]   My TikTok, my TikTok crew is failing.
[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:49.740]   All right.
[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:51.780]   Let's do it all over again.
[02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:54.940]   Click, click, SCN here.
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:56.780]   Let's see.
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:57.780]   Pick a video.
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:59.660]   What was his search history earlier today?
[02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:01.220]   It was questionable.
[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:02.460]   Let me hear.
[02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:03.460]   Let's see if this works for you.
[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:05.380]   I'm going to change your link to this one.
[02:14:05.380 --> 02:14:06.980]   No, no, I'm on his page.
[02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:07.980]   There.
[02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:09.980]   My honey pot was hacked.
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:11.420]   Yeah, we're just.
[02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:12.420]   There's this.
[02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:14.220]   The Hugh Hub offline.
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:15.620]   Yeah, do that one.
[02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:16.620]   All right.
[02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:17.620]   Here we go.
[02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:18.620]   There you go.
[02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:19.620]   We've got to go visit.
[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:23.020]   I mean, just the little touch of Japan in the middle of Los Angeles.
[02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:24.020]   Wait a minute.
[02:14:24.020 --> 02:14:25.020]   I got too many voices.
[02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:26.860]   I was going to say, what is happening?
[02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:28.500]   That's so many voices.
[02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:29.700]   I don't know what's going on.
[02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:30.700]   And even after St. Augustine.
[02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:31.700]   Leo, they're all in your head.
[02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:32.700]   They're on your own.
[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:34.260]   Wait, who are all these people?
[02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:36.020]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:14:36.020 --> 02:14:37.500]   Somebody else is playing there.
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:38.500]   What's going on?
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:42.140]   How many how many desktops are you running?
[02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:43.660]   Land access in all the technologies.
[02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:45.180]   And all that's well and fine.
[02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:46.180]   But the real concern here.
[02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:48.100]   Oh, I like his shelf food.
[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:51.580]   Bitdefender center findings too wise back in March of 2019.
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:53.740]   Oh, this is that that why story.
[02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:56.380]   Five minutes later to fix one is going.
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:14:58.660]   An engineer on the TikTok.
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:14:59.660]   Yeah.
[02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:05.540]   And so his stuff like he does like a lot of what he does is like my wife's device is
[02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:08.620]   one of my biggest was that it has the DNS hard-coded into it.
[02:15:08.620 --> 02:15:10.180]   It won't pick up my settings.
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:11.660]   And you're wondering what happens if I.
[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:12.660]   You know, I've always wondered.
[02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:16.460]   Maybe we should do our thing like this, you know, on the on the TikTok.
[02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:21.900]   Well, I don't know how many followers he has or how like I mean, I imagine it probably
[02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:23.900]   always got a lot more now.
[02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:24.900]   Thanks to Stacey.
[02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:25.900]   139,000.
[02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:26.900]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:27.900]   That's a good number.
[02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:29.580]   That's a hefty hefty number.
[02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:30.580]   Yeah.
[02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:33.740]   I mean, his stuff is legit.
[02:15:33.740 --> 02:15:35.740]   And he covers.
[02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:36.740]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:37.740]   He's trying micro.
[02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:38.740]   So he's trying micro link below.
[02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:42.900]   So I don't know if that's affiliate sharing or if he works for them.
[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:47.740]   I suspect that's a affiliate sharing as opposed to he doesn't say who he is.
[02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:48.740]   Yeah.
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:49.740]   All right.
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:54.260]   But I mean, but his his information is like maybe you don't trust him on his antivirus,
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:57.900]   but he's talking about like pork closures and things like that.
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:00.460]   He's spot on.
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:01.460]   Very good.
[02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:05.740]   He's a engineer on the TikTok SEC engineer.
[02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:06.740]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:16:06.740 --> 02:16:08.740]   I'm not going to do a number this week.
[02:16:08.740 --> 02:16:14.180]   Not going to do the man who had 39 attempts to get hired at Google and finally did.
[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:15.180]   All good for him.
[02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:16.180]   Happy ending.
[02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:17.180]   Yes.
[02:16:17.180 --> 02:16:22.020]   But instead I'm going to confess that I woke up yesterday morning and again this morning,
[02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:24.580]   ugly crying.
[02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:31.620]   My hero of the 60s came back on stage for the first time since 1969 at.
[02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:32.620]   Joni.
[02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:38.060]   I know you can't play it because it's music, but Joni did a jam and Joni Mitchell is just
[02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:41.820]   is just the absolute best she speaks to my life.
[02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:43.820]   And I was just standing there.
[02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:44.820]   I was wrong with it.
[02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:45.820]   Just go with it.
[02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:49.380]   Brandy Carlisle was there guiding her through it.
[02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:50.380]   Just doing it.
[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:53.380]   So is when you say guiding her through it is Joni okay?
[02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:54.380]   Oh, Joni's fine.
[02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:57.020]   And Joni was singing and Joni was doing a great job.
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:17:02.820]   But she was, Brandy Carlisle did a great job of joining in with her at times, leaving
[02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:05.860]   her solo at times, bringing in the whole group at times.
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:11.220]   She was just generous and brilliant at it.
[02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:12.420]   She lives near me.
[02:17:12.420 --> 02:17:13.420]   Brandy Carlisle?
[02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:14.420]   Yep.
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:16.420]   She lives out of the little bit where Washington.
[02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:18.540]   And not a wheelchair, but a big armchair.
[02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:19.540]   So I'm.
[02:17:19.540 --> 02:17:20.540]   You're both a big armchair.
[02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:21.540]   This is trying to mimic Joni Jans.
[02:17:21.540 --> 02:17:23.420]   Joni would do it her home.
[02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:24.500]   Oh, all right.
[02:17:24.500 --> 02:17:25.780]   Where she has lots of people in.
[02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:27.100]   She's had Paul McCartney.
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:29.500]   She's had all kinds of people in her home.
[02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:30.500]   She's the greatest.
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:31.500]   She's the greatest.
[02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.500]   Oh, brilliant.
[02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:33.500]   Brilliant.
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:34.500]   I also love Joni Mitchell.
[02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:35.500]   Yeah.
[02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:36.500]   Very nice.
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:37.500]   This is my youth.
[02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:41.100]   You had, you had, I don't know, behind her just, just be crying too.
[02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:42.100]   Yeah.
[02:17:42.100 --> 02:17:43.100]   I'm sorry.
[02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:48.500]   We can't play it folks, but look it up and look up the, there's, there's three official
[02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:49.500]   Newport.
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:54.340]   There's people from the audience put it up and, and I put up away feed yesterday today.
[02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:56.340]   But this official, what are you actually going to do?
[02:17:56.340 --> 02:17:58.420]   There's three very good official videos.
[02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:02.300]   And it is just amazing.
[02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:07.100]   There is, if you've not seen on Apple TV plus, and I think it didn't get a lot of attention,
[02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:14.220]   a documentary called 1971, the year the music changed everything.
[02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:19.460]   Joni features in it along with a lot of your other heroes, I'm sure Jeff, because
[02:18:19.460 --> 02:18:23.500]   we're the same age and 71 was a seminal year in music.
[02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:29.540]   Not only the year that Jimmy Hendrix, Janice Joplin and James and Jim Morrison all died
[02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:34.500]   at the age of 27, but also some great music came out.
[02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:39.940]   It's a wonderful about five part documentary about that year talks about the civil rights
[02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:43.420]   movement and it's really, I thought quite good.
[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:46.140]   Stacey, Ant, have you listened to Joni Mitchell's blue?
[02:18:46.140 --> 02:18:47.140]   Oh, yeah.
[02:18:47.140 --> 02:18:48.140]   Negative.
[02:18:48.140 --> 02:18:51.300]   I have a copy of Joni Mitchell's blue.
[02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:52.300]   Oh, my God.
[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:54.740]   I could not even have it on vinyl.
[02:18:54.740 --> 02:18:59.020]   We, that was the song the album you cried to for sure.
[02:18:59.020 --> 02:19:01.660]   They actually talk about blue, which came out in 71.
[02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:05.420]   They talk about blue and really reason for writing it.
[02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:07.460]   So it's quite good.
[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:08.460]   Yeah.
[02:19:08.460 --> 02:19:09.460]   All right.
[02:19:09.460 --> 02:19:10.460]   Good.
[02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:11.460]   That's a good number.
[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:12.460]   Crying, ugly crying.
[02:19:12.460 --> 02:19:13.460]   Yeah.
[02:19:13.460 --> 02:19:17.140]   Mr. Ant Pruitt, what's your thing?
[02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:22.220]   I really didn't have much, but I said I wanted to make sure I mentioned this one just to give
[02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:25.700]   a shout out to my uncle, uncle Mack, Mack Arnold.
[02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:27.620]   He turned 80 last week.
[02:19:27.620 --> 02:19:28.620]   Uncle Mack.
[02:19:28.620 --> 02:19:29.780]   And they did part one.
[02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:30.860]   We've seen him before.
[02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:33.180]   He performed for us, didn't he?
[02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:35.940]   He was, he's a blues artist.
[02:19:35.940 --> 02:19:40.460]   And just had a very, very great life.
[02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:41.940]   He was on the local news.
[02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:44.860]   They did the party at the Anderson Civic Center.
[02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:47.620]   He gave a shout out to my granddaddy.
[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:49.900]   His brother is just really moving to see that.
[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:53.940]   Was he your actual uncle or your granddaddy's brother?
[02:19:53.940 --> 02:19:55.260]   So he's your great uncle.
[02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:56.260]   Yeah.
[02:19:56.260 --> 02:19:57.260]   Great uncle.
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:19:58.260]   Yeah.
[02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:00.460]   And that's his wife there.
[02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:01.460]   Oh, and look at that.
[02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:03.860]   He plays the guitar of my grandfather before.
[02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:05.660]   Made out of a gasket.
[02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:06.660]   Wow.
[02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:07.660]   Yeah.
[02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:08.660]   Unbelievable.
[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:12.060]   And that's like a, you know, that's a probably a.
[02:20:12.060 --> 02:20:14.460]   Oh, I could see the family resemblance.
[02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:15.460]   Nice.
[02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:17.460]   Happy birthday to the family.
[02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:19.060]   I just want to give a shout out.
[02:20:19.060 --> 02:20:20.060]   Don't go back.
[02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:22.860]   Looking good at it, 80 doing your time.
[02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:23.860]   Wonderful.
[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:28.980]   And Pruitt, he's still on the insta at underscore Pruitt.
[02:20:28.980 --> 02:20:31.660]   Still fighting the good fight over there.
[02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:34.740]   Putting stills, not even going to tell people to follow me over there because you're not
[02:20:34.740 --> 02:20:36.660]   going to see what I publish anyway.
[02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:38.460]   Well, go on to YouTube then.
[02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:39.660]   You got to YouTube too.
[02:20:39.660 --> 02:20:40.660]   Yeah.
[02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:41.660]   Yeah.
[02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:43.660]   I just put some stuff up on YouTube yesterday and today.
[02:20:43.660 --> 02:20:46.460]   So how to get out of the creative rut.
[02:20:46.460 --> 02:20:48.900]   That's the latest.
[02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:49.900]   Are you in a creative?
[02:20:49.900 --> 02:20:51.380]   No, that's my headline.
[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:54.060]   That's my video, trailer video.
[02:20:54.060 --> 02:20:58.220]   The latest video is actually featuring the one y'all know and love.
[02:20:58.220 --> 02:20:59.420]   Queen Pruitt.
[02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:03.580]   I just did a little quick short, um, two minute video.
[02:21:03.580 --> 02:21:05.220]   Stop and listen.
[02:21:05.220 --> 02:21:06.220]   Stop and listen.
[02:21:06.220 --> 02:21:07.220]   Stop and listen.
[02:21:07.220 --> 02:21:08.220]   Good.
[02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:09.220]   Good.
[02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:10.220]   If you have headphones on, that's all I'll say.
[02:21:10.220 --> 02:21:11.220]   I love it.
[02:21:11.220 --> 02:21:14.660]   I'm going to prove it on the, on the YouTube.
[02:21:14.660 --> 02:21:15.660]   Yep.
[02:21:15.660 --> 02:21:21.100]   Ah, Jeff Jarvis put that lower third up so I can read it here.

[02:22:01.140 --> 02:22:02.140]   Okay.
[02:22:02.140 --> 02:22:03.660]   Somebody's got to edit that thing.
[02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:04.660]   Yeah.
[02:22:04.660 --> 02:22:07.620]   Thank you all three of you, uh, for being here.
[02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:10.300]   Thank you again, Jason Hall for filling in last week producing every day.
[02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:15.940]   Every week he helps the show so much more than you know behind the scenes as well as in
[02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:17.700]   front of the camera.

[02:22:31.620 --> 02:22:34.100]   If you remember Club Twitter course, there's a great discord effect.
[02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:36.780]   If you're not a member of Club Twitter, why not join it?
[02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:39.420]   We have a box of Monty Padfree versions of the show.

[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:48.740]   Pruitt is in charge of the community.
[02:22:48.740 --> 02:22:49.740]   Does such a great job.
[02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:50.740]   Hostess with the most.
[02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:51.740]   Yes indeed.
[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:56.980]   And, and I know right now, uh, we have our club to an event coming up tomorrow at the
[02:22:56.980 --> 02:22:58.740]   time of recording this video.
[02:22:58.740 --> 02:22:59.740]   Yes.
[02:22:59.740 --> 02:23:04.220]   Um, and there's someone in our discord right now watching the show that's going to be a
[02:23:04.220 --> 02:23:06.740]   part of that club to an event in the morning.
[02:23:06.740 --> 02:23:11.620]   Members, fireside chat nine am Pacific, but of course you can watch it after the fact
[02:23:11.620 --> 02:23:13.180]   on the twit plus feed.
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:17.780]   Alex Lindsay's AMA is August 18th and Stacy's book club.
[02:23:17.780 --> 02:23:21.620]   You still have a month to read Clara and the sun.
[02:23:21.620 --> 02:23:23.460]   That'll be August 25th.
[02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:25.660]   And I know you're planning more easy read events.
[02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:26.900]   It's a good read.
[02:23:26.900 --> 02:23:28.460]   It's a great book.
[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:29.700]   Really enjoying it.
[02:23:29.700 --> 02:23:32.060]   I'm doing it on Audible.
[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:35.660]   Um, seven bucks a month.
[02:23:35.660 --> 02:23:36.660]   What else did you get?
[02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:37.660]   Ad free versions of all the shows.
[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:38.980]   You get the twit plus feed.
[02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:43.420]   I think it's a good contribution to keeping us on the air.
[02:23:43.420 --> 02:23:44.500]   And it's a great community.
[02:23:44.500 --> 02:23:45.740]   So thanks in advance.
[02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:49.780]   You also get access to shows that are not on the public feed.
[02:23:49.780 --> 02:23:51.700]   Like hands on Mac.
[02:23:51.700 --> 02:23:52.700]   Mm hmm.
[02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:53.700]   It's on Windows.
[02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:54.700]   Mm hmm.
[02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:55.700]   And it's a great value.
[02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:56.700]   Yes.
[02:23:56.700 --> 02:23:57.700]   It's a kind of club.
[02:23:57.700 --> 02:23:59.980]   Micah Sargent has revived hands on Mac.
[02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:01.660]   We had to kill it because we couldn't get an audience.
[02:24:01.660 --> 02:24:06.540]   We couldn't get advertisers, but the club supports it so we can make a club only version
[02:24:06.540 --> 02:24:10.660]   of the show and should the audience grow, which I'm sure it will.
[02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:13.340]   We can go public with that ad supported.
[02:24:13.340 --> 02:24:16.260]   Same thing with Paul Therat's hands on Windows.
[02:24:16.260 --> 02:24:18.420]   Both of those available to you as a club member.
[02:24:18.420 --> 02:24:24.340]   You can also buy them individually $2.99 a month for all four episodes each month, which
[02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:25.700]   is also a great deal.
[02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:28.020]   All of that at twit.tv/club.
[02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:30.020]   Twit.
