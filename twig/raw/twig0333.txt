[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.080]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.440]   From people you trust.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.720]   This is Twig.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.520]   Bandwidth for this week in Google
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.800]   is provided by cashfly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.840]   This is Twig this week in Google,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.000]   episode 333 for December 30, 2015.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.160]   The year's best.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.520]   It's time for Twig in a very special episode
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.920]   as we close out on 2015.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.560]   Jason Howell, our editors and you have put together
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.800]   your favorite memories of the year.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.120]   So what this is about what you're about to see is a clip
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.280]   festival, the highlights.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.000]   And there have been some great ones of this week in Google.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.440]   Happy New Year, everybody.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.480]   We'll be back with a brand new show next week.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.680]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.120]   Thanks for being here.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.800]   Up next, the best of Twig.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.600]   Thank you for coming out for our New Year's Eve party.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.280]   Oh, it was great.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.960]   Still beardless, which he did for $20,000.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.520]   I am still hairless, which I did for $40,000.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.000]   We raised $75,000 for UNICEF.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.320]   The United Nations Show was fun, isn't that great?
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.880]   Amazing.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.400]   Nice job.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.640]   That's Gina Trappani from ThinkUp.com.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.280]   Hello.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.760]   And all about Android.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.800]   And I have some very sad news.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.520]   This is her last Twig.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.800]   Well, my last weekly, right?
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.360]   I mean, I'm--
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.920]   We said come back whenever you want.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.240]   But I know that the business that I think up
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.080]   has gotten busy, busy, busy, and you just
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.440]   don't have time to do.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.840]   She's also leaving all about Android.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.280]   In fact, you don't have any podcasts, right?
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.120]   No, no.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.800]   I won't be doing any podcasts the first time
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.880]   in like six years.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.120]   Yeah, this is just so sad and bittersweet.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.200]   But I started building this company, ThinkUp.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.360]   And I think we have a shot at making something
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.640]   that is sustainable.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.640]   But it's been-- it was like a weird kind of year.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.800]   2014 was hard.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.560]   We raised some venture capital, and then we figured out
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.040]   that we're a business, but we're not a venture capital
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.600]   business, meaning that we're not the hockey stick guys
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.800]   or 10 times, whatever.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.440]   We're just a regular business kind of building revenue
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.160]   very slowly.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.920]   So we decided, hey, we're not going to do VC.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.360]   We had to lay off a bunch of our team, which is really tough.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.880]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.400]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.960]   That's OK.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.120]   I mean, my team was fantastic, and everyone
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.880]   was extremely understanding, and totally got it.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.680]   Everyone landed on their feet, and it was a small team
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.960]   to begin with.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.920]   But yeah, it was tough.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.320]   It was definitely painful.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.080]   But you know, we--
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.600]   Anil, my co-founder, and I really want to give this a go.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.480]   And we want to work on it full time, the two of us together.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.400]   And that's what you plan to do in 2015.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.240]   And so it's going to be a full time job and a half.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.480]   And I've just been trying to be real honest with him
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.320]   and with my family and try to figure out what's--
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.820]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.840]   --you have a new baby.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.240]   And I mean, you just moved.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.400]   So there's a lot on your play.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.440]   I completely understand.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.560]   And I'm still bereft.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.440]   I'm still very sad.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.240]   Jeff and I had the same reaction the chat room is having
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.760]   right now, because they're hearing it for the first time.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.400]   I said, in capitalism, this is horrible.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.160]   Jeff, what did you write?
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.680]   It was great.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.160]   I got to read Jeff's tribute to Gina.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.800]   Because it was-- you said it-- of course,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.920]   you're the words, Matthew.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.840]   You said it better than either Lisa or I could do.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.560]   You're just quite moving.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.400]   Let me write it to you.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.920]   I am so depressed about this, Gina.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.400]   Oh, wait.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.360]   This is our email.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.840]   Yep.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.160]   If there's anything that would make the show possible,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.840]   I'd be so happy to keep working with you.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.160]   And we have worked out something, so stay tuned.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.560]   Gina's genius is bringing both a technologist's perspective
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.400]   and a profoundly ethical view of technology.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.960]   And she's the nicest person I know.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.520]   These are going to be impossible shoes to fill in.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.320]   We all agree.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.240]   Speaking of shoes, I then try to push Gina--
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.040]   Gina, pervericade.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.760]   If I try to push that we could do this like a shark tank,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.440]   where Barbara and Laurie shift off,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.240]   we could take Gina to give me the part time.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.240]   Your response, Gina?
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.320]   I said, I only wish that I could wear heels the way
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.960]   that Laurie and Barbara wear heels.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.440]   That email thread was quite fun, I must admit.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.920]   And Jeff really said it eloquently for Lisa and me.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.960]   Both.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.640]   There's no way we can replace you.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.520]   You have agreed.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.440]   I'm happy to say to come back once a month.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.160]   Yes.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.600]   Yes.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.000]   And thank you for letting me do that,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.600]   because I tell you the idea of quitting completely cold
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.960]   turkey really freaked me out.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.680]   This was such a hard decision.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.840]   I mean, we've been through a lot together.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.200]   It's been six years, 400 hours once a week.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.800]   I mean, I've lived in four different apartments.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   I've done this show from two different offices
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.480]   from my mother's basement.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.080]   I mean, yeah, I had a child.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.480]   I mean, yeah, a lot has happened.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.040]   We've been together for a long time,
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.840]   and I really wrestled with it.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.280]   And it's just a matter of hours in the day.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.680]   And part of it is that I'm primarily a developer.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.160]   You guys are embedded in news, right?
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.400]   It's easy for us.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.760]   It's always think about all week long.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.760]   But there have been times that I'm sure that our listeners
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.280]   have occurred.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.680]   There are times when I show up, and I'm like,
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.520]   I haven't heard the story.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.080]   I just haven't been reading the news.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.520]   So it's a little bit more prep time for me.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.280]   And it takes my hat out of, you know,
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.680]   I get into that coder flow thing.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.840]   And so-- and I'm just going to have more of my plate this year.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.560]   So it was such a hard decision.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.800]   But I've so enjoyed my time on the show.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.440]   And I am going to be back once a month.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.960]   Thank you.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.240]   And if I can harass Jason and Ron into having me on time--
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.240]   I don't think that'll be hard.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.240]   Harrass.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.960]   Are you killing me?
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.240]   Hopefully I can come back.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.600]   Anytime you name it, you're--
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.040]   to be honest with me, if you had won the Apparina,
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.120]   would you have stayed?
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.280]   Is this what we needed to do to keep you, Jina?
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.240]   Because I can fix it.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.360]   Windows 8, 1, vulnerability.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.440]   Microsoft knows about it.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.840]   In fact, they've known about it for three months,
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.040]   because Google told them--
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.600]   Microsoft waited.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.440]   Google announced it.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.760]   They said, after 90 days, it's fair game.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.520]   Microsoft, I'm sure, would have preferred the Google said
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.840]   nothing.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.240]   But Google's point-- and I think it's well taken-- is--
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.120]   if there's a security hole, it's reasonable for us
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.520]   to give the company a time to patch.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.560]   But it's also a public's right to know if this whole exists,
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.040]   because the company could otherwise just ignore it.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.840]   And attackers could find it.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.480]   Now, don't worry so much, because Microsoft
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.360]   points out that a bad guy would have to have
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.160]   valid login credentials and be able to log on locally
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.120]   to a targeted machine.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.920]   It's not something that could easily
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.920]   be done over the internet.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.440]   And--
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.200]   I have weird mixed feelings about this.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.160]   It feels like-- I mean, on one hand,
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.920]   I totally understand that Google notified Microsoft
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.320]   about this vulnerability.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.400]   Gave them 90 days.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.520]   And once the 90 days were up, even though Microsoft didn't
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.040]   issue the patch, announced the bug, published code.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.440]   I don't have a site bug.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.800]   They showed you how to do it.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.320]   I mean, I sort of get it.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.400]   But I also wonder a little bit--
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.640]   somebody from Google couldn't pick up the phone,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.000]   or cause somebody from Microsoft five days before,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.880]   and they're like, hey, now, really?
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.320]   Well, they may have.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.840]   It felt like a little bit of a public shaming,
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.800]   slap in the wrist, VR thing going on here at the--
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.400]   you know, at the risk of opening up users to a vulnerability.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.560]   Like, I really can see both sides of it.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.320]   I'd love to get your opinions on this.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.000]   We talked about David Cameron's speech on "Security Now"
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.080]   yesterday.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.560]   Oh, man.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.560]   I'll bet you did.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.760]   What a train race.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.160]   And I think Corey Doctorow had a good take down
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.280]   on "Boying, Boing."
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.280]   But--
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.080]   You did.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.760]   So Cameron, the prime minister of Great Britain,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.400]   says that it should be illegal to make a communications
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.360]   product that the law--
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.840]   that the home secretary can't listen in on.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.160]   And he said, it's OK.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.440]   You're protected.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.800]   Because the home secretary would have to sign a warrant
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.000]   for us to listen in on.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.680]   And now, I have to say, I think it's one thing for David
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.800]   Cameron to say that.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.680]   It's another thing for it to actually happen.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.320]   But what it reveals in the attitude--
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.480]   this is a Greenwald's argument-- what it reveals
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.680]   is just a terrible view of our rights.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.480]   Right.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.400]   And Corey argues it's also ignorance.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.200]   Yes, it's terrible.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.800]   He says, David Cameron says, there
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.440]   should be no means of communication which we cannot read
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.560]   and no doubt many in his party will agree with him politically.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.160]   But if they understood the technology,
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.920]   they'd be shocked to their boots.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.600]   Corey is always eloquent in this stuff.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.640]   So he says, Cameron doesn't know what he's asking for.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.600]   Because in order to make this work,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.120]   you can ban WhatsApp.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.960]   You can ban iMessage or Apple's Messages,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.560]   both of which provide encrypted message
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.760]   passing that the government can't read.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.800]   But first of all, you sure you want to ban iOS from Great Britain?
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   OK.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.400]   For Linux.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.360]   But then you can't ban Linux.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.760]   Who do you ban if you're--
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.920]   who do you stop for Linux or BSD?
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.440]   It makes no sense.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.520]   It makes no sense.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.400]   And it's like saying no one is allowed to have door locks,
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.720]   just in case we need to come in your house.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.720]   Right.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   Right.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.600]   But it'll be only for your own protection.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.480]   Well, OK.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.000]   But there is an analog there.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.600]   You know, if you have a gate here in this area,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   a lot of people in the farm areas have a gate before you can get in.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.160]   And they have a special key that the fire department--
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.480]   it's a special key the fire department can open.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.360]   Because if your house is burning down,
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.400]   you don't want the fire trucks to have to stop at the gate or drive them down.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   So there's an analog for that.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.520]   The TSA approved locks keep bad guys out,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.760]   but the TSA has a way of opening them.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.560]   So there's a precedent.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.640]   Corey points out, first of all, if you put a backdoor in any kind of software,
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.760]   that not only makes it easy for law enforcement,
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.000]   but criminals, voyeurs, and foreign spies.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.440]   You've made all communications insecure.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.800]   Right.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.160]   Any firms-- this is what Cameron's proposing when Corey breaks it down.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.320]   Any firms within reach of the UK government
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.400]   must be banned from producing secure software.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.440]   That includes Microsoft and Apple.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.320]   All major code repositories--
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.200]   GitHub and source forage, for example, have to be blocked,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.000]   because that's where you get the open source for programs like tech secure
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.600]   and others-- true crypt.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.720]   So you've got to prevent that.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.240]   Search engines must not answer queries about web pages that carry secure software.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.040]   I raised this point yesterday with Steve.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:00.520]   It also means that you have to have a backdoor in secure HTTP, HTTPS, SSL.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.880]   That's not an easy thing to do since that's essentially open.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.200]   Virtually all academic security work in the UK must cease.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.840]   Security research must only take place in proprietary research environments
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.480]   where there is no onus to publish one's findings, such as industry R&D and security services.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.240]   All packets in and out of the country and within the country must be subject
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.480]   to Chinese-style deep packet inspection.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.320]   We're just talking about that.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.640]   I'm sure Sandvine has a tool.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.640]   And any packets that appear to originate from secure software must be dropped.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:37.120]   Existing walled gardens like iOS and Xboxes must be ordered to ban their users
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.560]   from installing secure software.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.000]   Anyone visiting the country from abroad must have their smartphones held at the border
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.560]   until they leave.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.640]   That's the other one, yeah.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.440]   For proprietary operating system vendors like Microsoft and Apple
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.840]   must be ordered to redesign their operating systems as walled gardens
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.960]   that only allow users to run software from an app store which will not sell
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.680]   or give secure software to Britons.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.320]   Free and open source operating systems that power the energy, banking, e-commerce
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.240]   and infrastructure sectors must be banned outright.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:13.600]   So that's why Steve was upset and a lot of people are upset about this.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.440]   I think it's pretty clear.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.840]   It's unenforceable.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:25.040]   And even if it wasn't forable, it wouldn't achieve what it's supposedly going to achieve
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.240]   or wants to achieve the criminalized security software.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.840]   Only criminals will have to get it.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.680]   But what it indicates is a belief that there is a manifest destiny and a right
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.560]   for government to be able to listen to anything we say.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.840]   And that's the real issue.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.640]   That's what this reveals.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.040]   I agree.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.840]   It's telling into their state of mind.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:50.640]   Well, and unfortunately in Britain at least and in lots of other European countries,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.640]   it's taken for granted that the government has those rights.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:59.640]   I think US is abnormal in a way in the sense that people won't put up with that kind of stuff.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.840]   And that's the sad thing is that he's blaming the attacks on Charlie.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.440]   He's saying, well, after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in France, we've got to do this.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   Which makes no sense at all.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.840]   But that's what happened in the US.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.040]   As soon as 9/11 happened, we had the Patriot Act.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.640]   That's the kind of knee jerk reaction.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.040]   Here's a Prime Minister Cameron speaking.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.840]   Oh, after an ad.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.240]   How come there's an ad before the Prime Minister speaks?
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   Apparently people who are having erectile dysfunction.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.840]   Or maybe they're...
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.440]   That's actually the Prime Minister.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   No, it's a Charles Schwab.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.840]   The first duty of any government is to keep our country and our people safe.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.840]   The attacks...
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.840]   How much has been used?
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.840]   Is that the first duty of any government?
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   No, it's to give us this to protect our freedom indeed.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.840]   But how much tyranny has been wrought under that justification?
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.840]   And as Corey points out, it would not keep us safe.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:02.840]   It would open all communications to bad guys, spies, and Corey points out, warriors.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.840]   Paris once again demonstrated the scale of the terrorist threat that we face
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.840]   and the need to have robust powers through our intelligence and security agencies
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.840]   and policing in order to keep our people safe.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   And the powers that I believe we need, whether on communications data
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.840]   or on the content of communications, I'm very comfortable that those are
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.840]   absolutely right for a modern liberal democracy.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   But what I've done is, as you know, we legislated very recently.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.840]   So what are we going to have here, isn't it?
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.840]   It's totally the opposite of what should be allowed in a world of money.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.840]   Somebody's pointing on the chatroom and this is true also.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.840]   The Cameron's faced with... I don't know how significant,
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.840]   but somewhat of a challenge from the right-wing UKIP.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   The UKIP, yeah.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.840]   And that this may be merely a political statement that he knows has no chance
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.840]   of passing through Parliament.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.840]   I think he is trying to savor Radle and look tough.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   You know, he's not known for being tough and this is a great opportunity.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   Oh, look at all the terrorists.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.840]   But look at the justifications we have.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.840]   In France, there's been, since the Charlie Hebdo murders,
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.840]   there have been, I think, 54 examples of people being arrested for supporting terrorism.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.840]   Now, after a loud and clear support of free speech,
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.840]   then what turns around, we turn around and we abuse free speech.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.840]   In the American view, you support even obnoxious speech to support speech.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.840]   Right? The other problem was all, there have been great reports to Guardian
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   elsewhere of all of the heads of state who marched alongside Hollande,
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.840]   who are terrible things to free speech.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.840]   I know. It was really ironic to watch that parade of...
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.840]   Dictators.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.840]   France themselves just finished arresting someone for something they said.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.840]   Right. That's what we're saying.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.840]   54 cases of that.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.840]   They arrested a comedian, a well-known, but radical comedian in France,
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.840]   because he posted on Facebook something that they didn't like.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.840]   Right after saying, we have to uphold free speech.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   There's no free speech if you don't say what we agree with.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.840]   Right. Right. Right.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   That's really a case.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.840]   I don't want to go off the reservation here.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:24.840]   But that's one of the shocks to me in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo case,
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.840]   is that when I talk about free speech, what I get back often is,
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.840]   "Oh, you're American. You have a different view."
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.840]   And I wrote about this.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.840]   That free speech is weirdly oddly American.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.840]   No, it's not peculiarly American.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.840]   It is a human right.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.840]   And unless we see it that way...
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:50.840]   But the protection of it and the explicit protection of it is unusual to the US.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.840]   In many countries, other things take precedent.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.840]   Security...
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.840]   Sure.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.840]   But I think that's right.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.840]   I think there's a lack of understanding of what free speech means.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.840]   And that really struck me after this case.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.840]   And by the way, I also took to task American journalists and newspapers
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.840]   for not publishing the cartoons.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.840]   I understand, be clear here, I understand why the Jewish Chronicle didn't publish them.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:22.840]   But Margaret Sullivan, the public editor of the New York Times,
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.840]   first time she attacked the issue, she kind of danced around.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.840]   But today she came straight out and said the New York Times was wrong
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.840]   not to run the current new cover of Charlie Hebdo.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:38.840]   And that it's not offensive by any standard of civility, and it should be there.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.840]   And even our American newspapers don't really understand, I think,
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.840]   to some extent, that free speech is not just a rate for journalism, it's responsibility.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.840]   Well, and this comes up whenever I write about free speech,
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.840]   especially when I'm talking about proprietary platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.840]   that are effectively corporate-owned kind of town squares.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.840]   Someone will say, "Well, free speech only applies to government."
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.840]   Like the First Amendment is only designed to apply to government.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:18.840]   And so free speech is just a fiction unless it applies to how government treats
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.840]   citizens, which doesn't make any sense to me at all.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.840]   I mean, the whole point, the whole reason why there's a First Amendment is that it's a principle.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.840]   Well, I'll argue that case.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   No, the reason that is that part of your free speech is as an editor.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.840]   Part of Leo has free speech. Leo can say, Jarvis, I just don't like you.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   I've had it with you, fed up with you, and you're a damn Chromebook.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   Get off my ear.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   And he has a perfect right to do that.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.840]   That is part of his...
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.840]   I'm not the government.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:55.840]   But the government can't tell me to stop extolling the virtues of Chromebooks.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   It's not the government's rule.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:06.840]   But a deal of that has a private company has a full and complete right to decide what speech it chooses to distribute.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.840]   And that's not censorship.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.840]   Sure it does.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   And my only point when I wrote about Facebook was Mark Zuckerberg made a point of standing up
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:23.840]   in favor of free speech and against censorship and said he stood behind all of those principles
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:29.840]   despite the fact that Facebook routinely censors things for no reason or for reasons it doesn't discuss.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   I'm not saying they don't have the right to do that.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   I'm just saying you can't have it those ways.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.840]   You can't say that you're...
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.840]   Well, I think you can.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.840]   I think you can.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:43.840]   You set your standards because otherwise what we'd have, and this is what we have section 230 in the US,
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:50.840]   is that if it were a binary switch we would have no forms of no discussion in the US because if you were held responsible,
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:57.840]   as for example Europeans are, for the things that occur on your site or the things that you link to,
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   then you would have no discussion.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.840]   So section 230 protects us from making our own judgments so that we can make our own judgments.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   We can let things go up that we disapprove of.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.840]   We can take things down.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   That's our freedom.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.840]   No, I have to disagree with you there.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.840]   I think that there is a private section 230 protects them.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.840]   If section 230 protects them, then why do they take so much stuff down?
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   Because...
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.840]   Well, we'll get another way.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   Forget the Facebook.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:33.840]   Let's say that the comments on my blog, I take down things there that are offensive and stupid and off target and abusive,
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.840]   and that is not only my right, but I believe my responsibility to have a good community there.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:45.840]   If you believe that all speeches equal, all speech must be allowed, it's allowed by government,
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   but that doesn't mean that I should be forced to be the host for it.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   It's not inconsistent.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   It's not inconsistent.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:59.840]   It's not inconsistent for you to support censorship on Facebook and be against government censorship.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   That's not inconsistent.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.840]   That's not censorship.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.840]   That's not censorship, Leo.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   Or what else?
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.840]   Well, you could call it censorship.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.840]   It's censorship.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.840]   Let's say it's censorship.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   Censorship is when no.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.840]   Censorship is when government censures you from something.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   I'm willing to broaden.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   I'm willing to agree with Matthew to broaden it and say censorship is censorship.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   And it's just cutting something off your site for whatever reason.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.840]   It is a form of censorship.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   But it's still not inconsistent to say, "I have the right to do that as a private business,
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   and we should all fight against this."
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   The government doing that.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   Yes.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.840]   That's not inconsistent.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.840]   So it's not inconsistent for Mark Zuckerberg to say, "Yeah, of course, we have to control the environment on Facebook,
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.840]   and we don't want the government arresting somebody because they say something that the government disagrees with."
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   That's not inconsistent.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   But the fact is that Facebook and Twitter are used by governments to censor.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   They are actively censoring people on behalf of them.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:57.840]   They also say, Matthew, in that case, they also say they always say that they must follow local laws.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   Now Twitter, or--
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   No, it's not so cleverly.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   Twitter doesn't work cleverly.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.840]   It will cut out something in France and leave it in the rest of the world.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.840]   It's a French government that's being taken down.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.840]   Not just that.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.840]   They actually fight requests in court on behalf of the users.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:21.840]   They fight, and in some cases they have put content back that they took away because the government of whatever country didn't make a good enough case.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.840]   Facebook--
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.840]   So you were talking about a couple of the time.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.840]   One is when they are an agent of government.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:36.840]   When government says, "You must take this down under law," and they do that because they follow the law, if they even if they don't like it, they may fight it, but they lose and they take it down.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   That's one thing.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   It's another thing when they choose to take something down on their own.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:46.840]   Now Twitter was indeed a very, very open platform, but Twitter hit the wall with two things recently.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.840]   We talked about this in the show a while ago.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   One was the beheading videos, and two was the naked celebrity photos that have been stolen.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:58.840]   And Twitter decided basically for the first time really to say, "Okay, that's going too far.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   We are making an editorial judgment to take that down on our own without request."
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   That's their right to do.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:18.840]   But look, Google does not take down videos that criticize Turkey from YouTube because there's a law in Turkey against criticizing Turkishness.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.840]   No, they don't.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   And they get blocked from Turkey because they make a choice to leave that coming up.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   Because YouTube is blocked in Turkey, and they've chosen to go that way.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:44.840]   Right, so I'm saying at some point a company has to decide whether they are just going to roll over for every government request or whether there are things they are not going to do when asked by government.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.840]   Right, okay, we agree there, yes, and so Google of us got out of China.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:58.840]   But are you suggesting that every company should pull out of every country where the government demands they do something they can't do?
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.840]   That's the end doctrine.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.840]   I think you have to punish these countries for having that kind of reactionary point of view.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.840]   And if these companies did, the countries would soon turn around, I think.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.840]   Yeah, Google should pull out of Europe.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.840]   I agree.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840]   What?
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.840]   Look at that.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.840]   YouTube a number of times, even though so they'll punish them and block them, and then they put them back on again.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:34.840]   I just think if Facebook has principles, which it sounds like they do, then they should stick to them instead of bending over for every government that asks them to take something down.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.840]   On Facebook, I agree.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.840]   Yeah, as to why.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.840]   But it's not as simple as that.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.840]   Well, I'll tell you why it's not.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.840]   They're publicly held companies, and they have a fiduciary right to their stakeholders to maximize profits.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.840]   And it's hard in that environment to take a principled stand, I think.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.840]   If it's a privately held company, they should do it.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:08.840]   I don't want to go down a rat hole here, but someone recently pointed out to me that companies do not actually have a legal fiduciary duty to maximize profits.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.840]   They don't?
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.840]   No.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   Not a legal duty, but shareholders could punish them.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.840]   Sure.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   They could punish their own shareholders like everybody out, but they don't have any legal leaders in the market.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:26.840]   And of course, any company, public or not, has the right to lose money and do a run a crappy business.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.840]   I'd also like to always protect it from that.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   Mark Zuckerberg controls the majority of the votes.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.840]   True.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.840]   Voting shares in Facebook and the border.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.840]   So he faced no risk.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.840]   He can do whatever he wants.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.840]   He faced no risk.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.840]   What do you say Zuckerberg should do?
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.840]   Be specific.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.840]   Should Facebook pull out of 20 countries?
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.840]   Should they pull out of every country that doesn't have a First Amendment?
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.840]   I would like to see Facebook put up a bit more of a fight.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.840]   That's what I would like to see.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.840]   You think Twitter is a good model for this fight?
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.840]   Twitter puts up a fight.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.840]   Twitter is a better model, but I don't think I think you're presuming that Facebook doesn't fight.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.840]   Facebook also has a transparency report.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.840]   Google has transparency report.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   They all fight.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.840]   Twitter does more and more cleverly, but Twitter does other things that are odd, but I think Twitter is a model.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.840]   Some of the fighting from some of the companies looks like window dressing.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.840]   Facebook does not say in its transparency report, I don't think specifically what the complaint
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.840]   is or what content it involves.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.840]   They can't.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840]   They're not out yet.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.840]   Sure they can't.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.840]   Look, Google doesn't either.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   Google says they get between one and nine hundred requests from government, and that was after fighting.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.840]   Twitter will tell you what the order was, what it related to.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   Not in a lot of cases, they cannot.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.840]   They can't.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.840]   They can't in cases where the US government has asked them for data.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.840]   Right.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.840]   If it's a national security letter, they have to shut up.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.840]   But if the Turkish government files a court order saying take down that thing because it makes fun of Kamal Huddeter,
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.840]   they can certainly say that and they don't.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:02.840]   So, and by the way, Amir Afrade, who works at the information, has such great context at Google.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:13.840]   Often, breaking scoops Google plans to shake up the US wireless market, he writes, by selling voice plans to consumers directly from Google through T-Mobile and Sprint.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.840]   So, I guess to become an MVNO.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.840]   Yep.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.840]   It's the latest example of how Google tries to prod incumbents to change their business to benefit Google.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:30.840]   That's what they do with Google fiber, show you that it's possible to have a gigabit ISP and make money on it.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:36.840]   Google is expected to reach deals to buy wholesale access to the carrier's mobile voice and data networks.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.840]   It's codenamed NOVA.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.840]   Nick Fox is leading in a long time Google executive.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.840]   And Amir says at launch, this year seems likely.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.840]   It makes sense in a lot of ways.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.840]   I'm kind of surprised they haven't tried it before now.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.840]   Disney is an MVNO.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   I mean, Virgin.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.840]   I mean, there's so many MVNOs.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:57.840]   It's an easy thing to do.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   Well, I think there's a timing issue here because they couldn't at the point when they were trying to launch Android across all carriers, they couldn't do this.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.840]   Now where the carriers aren't going to drop Android, they can do this.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   Yep.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   Good point.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.840]   It's interesting that Sprint and T-Mobile are...
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   They probably have mobile networks with these carriers already, right?
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:26.840]   Explain to me why Sprint and T-Mobile are willing to have these third parties lease wholesale data and sell below their...
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.840]   retail prices offer better plans.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.840]   I think both of them are struggling.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.840]   I guess they need to, huh?
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.840]   It feels like, yeah.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.840]   So there's a fixed cost and a variable cost.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.840]   So the fixed cost is maintaining the network and growing it, and they want to keep doing that.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   And then there's a variable cost, which is running all the stores and signing people up and recruiting them and so on.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   And so if they can offload some of that variable cost stuff to somebody else, they're happy to do that because they help some of the fixed costs.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.840]   That's basically how MVNO stuff works.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.840]   The other thing is that the reason it's those two is that they're the GSM ones.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:05.840]   So they're the ones that you're actually straightforward to interoperate with as opposed to Verizon, which is weird as anything.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   And AT&T, which is not quite as weird but still slightly odd.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   Right.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.840]   Whereas GSM is like the global standard.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:17.840]   The reason you can pull sims out of phones and put different ones in, have them work broadly is that they use GSM.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:22.840]   And yeah, there are different bands and you have to have different radio frequencies and it's actually slightly more complicated than that.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:27.840]   And sprints not though, sprints is CDMA carry. So they would have one GSM and one CDMA carry.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.840]   Oh, so I think that's interesting about this is it's both.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.840]   Okay.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   And I think that's probably why it is both because I think they want to be able to say whatever kind of phone you have, you can bring it over.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   That makes sense.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.840]   The risk, I mean, as Amir mentioned, sprint and T-Mobile, their networks are not as robust.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.840]   They don't have as good coverage.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   Yeah, they also ran.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.840]   That's why they're willing to do it.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.840]   Exactly.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:59.840]   The reason that Google has held back on this, Amir writes is because they didn't want to upset wireless carriers.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.840]   They needed them to carry Android phones. Now it's not such a big deal because what's...
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.840]   I just said that.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.840]   You just said that? Sorry.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.840]   I'm just saying.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   And the other, but okay, then I'll add you say this. The other reason is antitrust.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   I think if Google were to come along and say, why don't we just buy T-Mobile? They could do that.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   But the likelihood of government approval, I don't know, might be an unknown.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:32.840]   So this is a great way to do it. And as you point out, cleverly, in advance of Maya insight, that now they don't have to worry about pissing off the other guy.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.840]   You just said it so eloquently. I didn't understand you.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.840]   [laughter]
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   They didn't want to piss off the other guys.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.840]   [laughter]
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:51.840]   I think I'd be tempted. It wouldn't even have to be less expensive if I thought Google was going to deal with me more fairly and have better customer service.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   But Google's not exactly known for customer service, are they?
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.840]   No.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:02.840]   Right. Well, it's a trade-off, right? So I had a problem with... I used T-Mobile because I think they were actually services.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:09.840]   Their deals are pretty good. Their services are good. But I had a problem last week where my phone stopped working on Wednesday, just so I was getting on the train to San Francisco.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:17.840]   And so when I got to San Francisco on Wi-Fi, I was tweeting them saying, "Oi, my phone stopped working. What's up with this?"
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.840]   They were like, "Oh, try turning it off on our games." Like, "Yes, try that."
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.840]   I was also trying to take the thing out of putting it back in again.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.840]   It is not a physical floor. It's a network floor.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.840]   And then after doing that with customer service, I said, "Okay, yeah, you're right. I'm going to have to transfer this to engineering."
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.840]   They'll get back to you within 72 hours.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:43.840]   I was like, "I wasn't actually going to San Francisco for the rest of the week, so I let it sit for 72 hours."
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:50.840]   But that got me to Saturday, and Saturday was like, "They still haven't fixed this, and they haven't responded to me any further with updates."
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.840]   So I went to the shop and said, "Okay, give me a new sim now, please."
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   And that straightforward, when I get a new sim, and then it worked. So clearly it was not necessarily the sim, but the networks knowledge of the sim.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:11.840]   But it's like, "You should have told me to go to the shop. You have retail shops for this exact purpose. Why did you tell me to wait 72 hours for engineering to look at it?"
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:18.840]   So it's one of those like, "Yeah." But the thing is, Google doesn't have retail shops. So if that happened to me with Google, they would have the Merri one.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:33.840]   Erica G and her chatroom says she has Google fiber, and the service is excellent on Google fiber. So Google has figured out in a consumer facing business, at least how to do it right, presumably that would apply to an MVNO.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:49.840]   And I wonder whether, you know, would Google, would they be prepared to help Sprint and T-Mobile with their networks? I mean, if they Google has lots of people who understand networks, lots of people who have got tons of fiber, maybe they can actually help improve those services.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.840]   Mm, intriguing.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.840]   And then by them.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.840]   Well, I think that's got to be the ultimate goals. How could it just buy?
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.840]   Head of Deutsche Telekom was flying a kite about selling T-Mobile at night this week. Oh, wasn't he? Yeah.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.840]   They've been trying to sell that for ages. Remember, SoftBank was going to, or was that Sprint? Yeah.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   Wasn't SoftBank going to buy them? And then they were there's Sprint T-Mobile merger. Mm-hmm.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:19.840]   But historically, the US government has not looked too kindly on these things. They don't care if Comcast and Time Warner merge. That's fine.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.840]   Apparently, the telco lobbyists are not as effective.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.840]   But Google buying T-Mobile would be less of an issue because it wouldn't reduce...
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.840]   They're not in the same business. Yeah, they're not in the same business.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:36.840]   I mean, it would create vertical integration, which is not a kind of problem, but it's that's...
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.840]   They're less worried about these days, I think.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.840]   I'd be all for it.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:47.840]   According to GreenBot, Cyanogen wants to take Android away from Google. We do a better job.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:57.840]   Let us maintain Android. Kirk McMaster wants to build Cyanogen, which...
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:07.840]   The history of Cyanogen is kind of interesting. It was originally a custom ROM that people would root their Android phones and put Cyanogen on there.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:13.840]   And it was basically an AOSP version of Android that you would then...
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:20.840]   I don't know, quasi-legally download all the Google apps and make it a Google phone. Sorry, Google. I wasn't talking to you.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.840]   Oh, do you need something? I'm here. I'm ready.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.840]   What?
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.840]   There was some boss. Don't get it wrong. We don't get it wrong. We're all right.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.840]   Do you want me to look up something about Cyanogen? I can do that. I'm right here.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   Let's go up for one.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.840]   McMaster.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:48.840]   I think putting it on OnePlus One gave it some real credibility because now it is the official operating system on at least one high-end Android phone.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   And frankly, those of us who used it, Gina was always very complimentary. I know you were too.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.840]   Really liked it.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:35:01.840]   So Kirk McMaster is saying he helps to build CM into a full-fledged Android rival. He wants its own App Store, a more open structure.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.840]   Makes no sense to me.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.840]   No sense.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   You're going to fight against another App Store. Developers have to build for another App Store.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   Well, that's true. But I do agree with him when he says that Android is really becoming a commercial product favoring Google services.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:32.840]   And while there is AOSP, nobody wants... AOSP is the open source Android minus Google stuff.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:43.840]   And no sane phone manufacturer is going to do that. Amazon is the best example of somebody who took AOSP and forked it and did without use.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:53.840]   The whole reason I use Android is because it is integrated with Google+ and Google Mail, with Gmail and Google Maps and so on.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.840]   That's exactly the selling point.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:10.840]   I think for you, but if you were in a developing country where you just wanted a cheap phone that worked pretty much as the way the iPhone does, but didn't come with that price tag, then you might not care that it has to work with Google.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:18.840]   Cops don't like ways. They say this could be dangerous that ways tells you there's a police officer on the road.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.840]   Big bad Google again.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.840]   They call it a stocking feature.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.840]   Which is ridiculous.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:38.840]   I doubt cop killers use ways, but maybe anyway, they're campaigning to pressure Google to turn off, because Google owns ways now.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:44.840]   The feature that warns drivers and police are nearby, it could put lives in danger.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.840]   Basic lesson is you can't control information anymore guys. We'll find some way to know where you are.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:54.840]   That information gets there because other ways users spotted a police officer.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:37:01.840]   Usually the reason for it is because it's a speed trap or they just want to let you know you should drive more carefully.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.840]   It's also an indication that there's been an accident or something that was on top there.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.840]   You have a button for accident too.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.840]   You do, yes.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.840]   My experience is this is more like a "hey, slow down."
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:18.840]   But Google's answer was the more people think there are cops all over the slower they're going to drive.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.840]   It's actually better.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   Julie Mossler speaking for Waze says, "Waze does work with the New York Police Department and others around the world by sharing information.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:35.840]   These relationships keep citizens safe, promote faster emergency response and help alleviate traffic congestion."
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:42.840]   I mean, it's hard because whenever they do a DUI checkpoint, they're required by law to tell you they're going to...
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.840]   Oh, really?
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.840]   They have to pronounce it.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.840]   They have to pre-announce where they're going to be.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.840]   Wow.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.840]   You have to know.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.840]   Why is that?
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:56.840]   Because people have a right not to, I guess, get into search area.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.840]   I don't know why it is.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.840]   Maybe it's just a California law, but they have to announce them in advance.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.840]   Also, when you come up to a checkpoint, you have to have the ability to turn away from that checkpoint if you don't want to go through it.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:08.840]   No, you're kidding.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.840]   Yeah, I think I did a story on checkpoints once.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.840]   Not my neck of the woods.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.840]   Out here, they block all the turns.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.840]   And then they're probably violating the law.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.840]   And if you actually got a ticket, first of all, if you got a ticket, I'd probably hope that you did.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.840]   But sorry.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:27.840]   No, you're supposed to be able to turn off.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.840]   That's part of the way the law works.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:39.840]   This is not the first time four U.S. Senators in 2011 asked Apple to remove all applications that alert users to drunk driving checkpoints.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.840]   Which was...
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:45.840]   Nokia removed the sobriety check tracking function in one of their apps.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.840]   Trapster was eventually discontinued at the end of the year.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   But the founder says it was because Waze did so much of a better job.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.840]   I understand police would be nervous about this.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.840]   But you know, if you were going to...
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.840]   I mean, you can totally understand it, especially what happened in New York.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.840]   My first initial reaction when I saw that was like, "Wow, yeah, that is scary."
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:14.840]   And then if you think a bit more, it's like it is not difficult for you to figure out where police are without having to...
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:20.840]   If you're going to go out trying to find a police officer, you probably don't need to rely on Waze to figure out how to do it.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.840]   But it's the truth is people don't just have guys who are on patrol in there.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.840]   The truth is they're putting up speed traps.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   And then...
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   God, I'll be again.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.840]   Google has a point that you end up slowing down.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:39.840]   The cops don't get to zap as many people, but if people are actually going slower, it's better.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.840]   Well, when we get the auto driving cars, it won't matter because then we'll be eating it all because.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:50.840]   And they'll report on all your movements and then we'll have a privacy crisis and that'll be the world.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.840]   Google has added a virtual genius bar.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.840]   Have you seen this?
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.840]   I think it's used for trademarked, surely?
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.840]   They're actually using helpouts.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.840]   It's called Google Device Experts.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   It's kind of like Mayday from Google.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:15.840]   So, employees of all with a service told TechCrunch, it's been in testing since November.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:23.840]   Google spokesperson has said we're in a limited trial of an experimental support feature gathering feedback, not yet ready to share full plans.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.840]   Is this the thing we call that day?
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.840]   No, it's different.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.840]   This is in the devices section of Google Play.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:45.840]   So, you're on the web, you're in Google Play in the devices section, click the Help icon top right corner, and then under Contact Us, there will appear a video call button and that will give you a Google Hangouts with a Google expert who can help you.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.840]   So, we can't call anybody now?
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.840]   Well, I can try it.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.840]   They say you can share your screen.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.840]   So, this is very much like Mayday, isn't it?
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.840]   Hmm.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.840]   So, let's go to play.google.com and see what we can do.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.840]   I don't think it's rolled out yet.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   I think it's just something they've spotted.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.840]   So, there's devices.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.840]   Here's Help.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.840]   Is video call?
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.840]   Video call.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.840]   Video call.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840]   Yep.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.840]   How can we help you?
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.840]   What do I need?
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840]   Can...
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.840]   Broke my Nexus 6.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.840]   I use...
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.840]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.840]   Can I use...
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.840]   Skype on Chrome OS?
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.840]   Skype?
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.840]   Ooh.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.840]   Oh, I hate that.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.840]   OS?
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.840]   Question mark.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   Start a video call.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.840]   Wow.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.840]   Sorry, this is going to be good.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.840]   I'm trying to troll them, but you know, why not?
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.840]   You're the first one here.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.840]   Ready to join.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.840]   Now, I think, uh, would you like to share your screen?
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.840]   We have to kind of tell...
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.840]   Somehow...
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.840]   Don't show this.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.840]   We have to tell them we're doing this before we actually do it.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.840]   Somehow.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.840]   Share my screen.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   Google Hout...
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.840]   It says sharing your screen with plus.google.com.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.840]   You are screen sharing, present to everyone, but I'm not...
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.840]   They hear my audio, but no one is coming in the room.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.840]   Oh!
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.840]   They're...
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.840]   They're getting something out of the microwave.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.840]   Oh!
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:12.840]   Hey!
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:13.840]   How you doing?
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.840]   Can I...
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   I'm on a...
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   Don't play as audio yet.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.840]   I'm on a podcast called This Week in Google.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.840]   My name's Leo.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.840]   And I'm wondering if I can show people...
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.840]   Because we're showing people this new feature.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.840]   If I can show people your screen and we can record your voice.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   But Doug, before I can show this, I need your permission to record it.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.840]   Go for it, Leo.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.840]   Go for it, Leo.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.840]   All right.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   Thank you, Doug.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.840]   So everybody's gonna see you now.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.840]   I guess.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.840]   And I have nothing confidential on my screen, so go ahead and look at it.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.840]   I...
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.840]   Well, thank you for sharing your screen.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.840]   But yeah, so that you had a question about using Skype on Chrome OS.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.840]   Yeah, can I?
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.840]   So currently Skype is currently not supported on Chrome OS.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:43:01.840]   There are, however, great alternatives for video chatting on Chrome, on Chrome books as well,
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   as well as communication apps that are available on the Chrome Web Store.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.840]   Including Hangouts.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.840]   Are you familiar with Hangouts?
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.840]   I am.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.840]   We love Hangouts.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.840]   In fact, we're using...
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:12.840]   This is Helpouts, isn't it?
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.840]   Isn't that what we're using right now?
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.840]   We're actually...
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.840]   We're on a Hangout right now.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:21.840]   Hangouts is kind of similar to Hangouts, but we're actually just straight up on Hangouts.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.840]   This is plain old Hangout.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.840]   And Doug, are you a Google employee or are you a third party?
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.840]   Yeah, I work at Google.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.840]   We're here in beautiful Mountain View.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.840]   You're in Mountain View?
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.840]   I love your set.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.840]   That looks so cool with the Android stuff there.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.840]   You know, we are very Googly here at Google.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.840]   I know.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.840]   How many of you are there doing this?
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.840]   I know we have a small team.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.840]   I wouldn't be able to put a number to it though.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.840]   I'm really bad at math and counting.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.840]   That's okay.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.840]   But there are other people and you're all kind of near each other doing this?
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.840]   Yeah, kind of.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.840]   I'm not too sure how big the team is, but I do have my own team here.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.840]   And we are all kind of our team of device experts.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.840]   Now, did you...
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.840]   Were you a Google employee before this or were you hired specifically to do this kind of support?
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:15.840]   You know, actually, because you're kind of our press, we do kind of...
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.840]   You can't talk to me.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:17.840]   I understand.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.840]   I do have a link for you if you like.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.840]   It's a press at Google.com.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.840]   Yeah, I'm familiar with that.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.840]   And I apologize for ambushing you, but that's why we asked you ahead of time.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.840]   No, no, I'm just here.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.840]   If I can help spread the word or kind of...
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.840]   Well, you are.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.840]   What we're doing is that's cool.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.840]   Yeah, lots of people now are going to try this out.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.840]   And I love Doug how you shared that link with me.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.840]   And it was in a little window down here and I could just click that to go to press.google.com.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.840]   That was cool.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:45.840]   Hey, this is really neat.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.840]   Hey, Doug, you're great.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:47.840]   I really appreciate you.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.840]   You like to speak at Google?
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.840]   Yeah, we could hire you as a host of this week in Google.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:51.840]   We've got to replace Gina here.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.840]   Hey, it's very nice to meet you, Doug.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.840]   I really appreciate it.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.840]   Thank you.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.840]   It was really great talking to you, Leo.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.840]   All right.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.840]   It's a great demo of what you guys can do.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.840]   Thanks.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:03.840]   Take care.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.840]   Have a nice day.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:05.840]   Go ahead and see us another hangout.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.840]   I will.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.840]   Hi, Doug.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:08.840]   Hi, Doug.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.840]   Hi.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.840]   That is so cool.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840]   That is great.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.840]   He was really good sport.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.440]   That never gets old.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.840]   Calling Google support on this show never gets old.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.840]   Oh, I know you did it first on all of that.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.840]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, but I think it's great.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.840]   I think it's awesome.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:28.400]   And I would imagine you guys are pretty darn impressed as impressed as I am because for
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.200]   the longest time Google and support have not been two words that have shared like.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.880]   It's a human associated with good, yet both of these times that we've done it on this
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.640]   show that the response has been super quick.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:44.040]   They've, you know, I'm sure if we would have dove in with a, you know, pretty hard work
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.000]   question, probably would have got a good answer.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   I'm pretty impressed.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.880]   By the way, he did not refer to a notebook or anything.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.160]   At least not that I could see.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.160]   He knew the answer.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.440]   Yeah, he wasn't doing a swallow page.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.640]   Yeah, let me go to.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:06.880]   He did the play store and clicking the question mark icon and then under contact us, there's
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.280]   a video call.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.360]   At least there was online.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.360]   There's also live chat and phone.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.040]   And that is impressive for people who have in the past said, oh, I don't know.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.720]   I can't get support from Google.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.480]   Now they don't do this for Gmail and stuff like this.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.960]   Although he did answer a question about promo.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.960]   Yeah, I did.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.960]   Wow.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.000]   That is a close one.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.200]   Well, they sell Chromebooks here.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:38.320]   So, you know, but they sell products here that are covered the entire spectrum of Google
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.320]   stuff.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.320]   Now, if I've been obnoxious, I could have asked whether there's any possible use for
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.320]   my Google Glass.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.920]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   Because Glass is still available in the store and...
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:49.920]   No, it's not.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.920]   You can't buy.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.920]   I think they just have it there.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:52.920]   I don't think you buy it.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.760]   But I think they would still support it if you ask.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:00.480]   So speaking of right time, timing is everything if you're selling shares of your company.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:06.720]   Larry Page's Sergei Brin have decided to, according to a filing with the SEC, sell off
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.520]   some shares.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.520]   That's nice.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:17.240]   As of January 30th of this year, they had a total of 44.6 million shares of Class B and
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.600]   44.6 million shares of Class C stock.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:26.160]   They're going to sell 2 million each of the Class B common stock.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.480]   And of course, only Google founders and Googlers can have Class B, so it'll convert to Class
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.080]   A upon sale.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.520]   And then another 2 million shares each of the non-voting Class C, which I presume will
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.760]   also convert, for a total of $ching 4.4 billion.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.760]   Wow.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.680]   But they're only selling 10% of their holding.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.680]   Right.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.400]   I mean, they're still the major controllers of the company.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.880]   Does it, you know, it's--
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.000]   Well, they're only 11.9%.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.920]   But they have 52% of the voting power.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.200]   They really-- when Google went public, this was considered at the time, they did some
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:05.280]   really interesting things when they went public, including the-- was a Dutch auction they did,
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.240]   but they also made sure that they kept a lot of the voting power.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.720]   Well, the split aimed even more controls, I remember, right?
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   Yes.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.720]   When they did the split.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.720]   That's right.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.720]   They converted some shares.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:24.080]   52% of the voting power, nobody's going to change the plans at Google anytime soon.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:28.360]   Class B shares, mostly owned by Bryn Page and Eric Schmidt, have 10 times the voting
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.360]   power.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.400]   I love this picture.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.560]   This is from Business Insider.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.560]   That's Larry.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.760]   That's 2006.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.240]   They're a little older than that grayer than that picture.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.840]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:48.240]   I don't think anybody in the stockholders should worry that they're selling it.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:52.400]   You know, it's 10% cash in a little stock.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.400]   I wish I could cash it $4.4 billion worth of something.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.080]   I wonder what they'll do with it.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:03.400]   Yeah, it leads to things like philanthropy and estate planning and probably buying another
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.920]   plane or something, investing.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:11.120]   It gets to be a point that where you have so much money that you don't even really-- it's
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.120]   absurd.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:16.600]   It's got to be a different world where you don't even have to-- I mean, I can't even
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.600]   imagine.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.360]   It's just a different world.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.360]   There is a burden, though.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.360]   I don't know.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.840]   How philanthropic is-- are they?
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.400]   And how philanthropic is Google?
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.000]   There's a point where it gets to be sandwiched.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.160]   Google does a fair way.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.160]   Google does a fair way.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.160]   Google does a fair way.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.160]   Do they?
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.160]   Google.org, don't forget.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.640]   They pledged a portion of equity, a portion of revenue.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:41.460]   You know, Benny Off is the leader of that in San Francisco of pushing companies to
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:46.240]   replenish portions of revenue and portions of revenue, portions of equity and portions
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.040]   of employee time.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:54.600]   Each year, Google.org donates $100 million in grants, $1 billion in products and 80,000
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.800]   hours in Google Earth time.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   That's pretty good.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:06.240]   But to Larry and Sergey have their own-- is there a page foundation or a-- I think one
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.480]   of them does related to health stuff.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.480]   That's right.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.480]   I think it's Larry.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.480]   That would be Larry, right, stuff.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.480]   He's Larry.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.480]   Fix, stuff.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.600]   You know, the other thing is, there's nothing to say that they have to be public about it.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.600]   Right.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.600]   And you don't know what they could give.
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.240]   In fact, I think that's the way to do it.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.920]   The left hand should not know what the right hand is.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.280]   You know, but I was thinking about that.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.760]   I was almost going to call into the Stern Show for some reason.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.320]   I forget what the peg was.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:39.080]   And ask Howard because he's very public about his wife's charity, which is the Long Island
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.360]   animal shelter that she's building for cage-free cats.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.360]   So he does stuff.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.360]   He does a calendar.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.760]   He takes the photos, so on and so forth.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.040]   You know that he does other philanthropy.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.640]   He mentions it very discreetly.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.640]   Good.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.640]   But doesn't talk about it.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.640]   But I was wondering about this.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.600]   And I wanted to ask him.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:57.840]   And I guess I understand why it's a matter of humility.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.720]   And it also is an opportunity to promote a cause or a charity that you care about.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:07.880]   And by not saying I give to blank, then you give up that opportunity.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:12.480]   I understand where you don't, both from, you know, let's not trumpet my charity, says
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.720]   rich person.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:18.440]   And also because once I mention one charity, they're all going to come running.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.280]   Like universities, like this one.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.680]   Well, you'd also want to be a role model, right?
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.480]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:30.040]   Right, but I think part of why you don't disclose is because it could look like you give preference
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.960]   to certain groups over others.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.280]   Wouldn't it, wouldn't it, the right kind of disclosure be something like I give 10% of
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.680]   all my income to charity, period.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.920]   And then, you know, choose the charity of your choice and, but do.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.440]   I mean, this all comes from this perception.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.360]   And I don't know if it's real anymore, but for a long time there's this perception that
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:58.160]   the Silicon Valley was minting millionaires, but they were not very progressive in their
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.520]   charitable contributions.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.680]   I don't know if that's still the case.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.600]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.680]   I don't know either, but if you're a millionaire and you have a really good accountant, an
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.440]   accountant is going to advise you.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.840]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.680]   You know, to do that, you know.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:22.480]   Actually, it actually, I should be because I have an accountant and the truth is that
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:28.920]   they keep the federal government keeps raising the threshold of your AGI for what you could
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.280]   deduct.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:34.320]   And so, in fact, they are not incentive giving as much as they should.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.920]   They're disincenting it all the time.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.920]   I can't remember what the threshold is now, but I think it's over.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:43.120]   It was 4%, I think it's gone up.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.120]   And that's wrong.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:47.720]   But you have to give more than 4% of your income before you could start deducting it.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.720]   That first 4% is tax on you.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.600]   Just the same thing they do with medical expenses.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:59.360]   And that just doesn't seem like the right way to promote philanthropy.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.400]   What we, I don't know if I should talk about this.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:11.000]   It turns out that you can deduct from $1 if you do something called community development.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.600]   So when we, and we give, Twit gives a lot, a lot of my charities, all my charities,
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.240]   almost as local.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:22.520]   And that's one of the reasons, because then you can deduct it from zero from $1 if it's
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.160]   called community development as opposed to charity.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.280]   Anyway, there's ways and ways.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.480]   That's why you have an account.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:33.240]   I have two major charities, Tufts University and the next one.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.240]   And the next one?
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.240]   Oh, my daughters.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.240]   My daughters.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.240]   Oh, the next university.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.240]   Tell me about that.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.240]   I'm in college.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.240]   That's a charity.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.040]   Yeah, they're both nonprofits.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:52.560]   All right, I got a new product for you.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.800]   Just got the box.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:54:00.680]   I got a mysterious email from Motorola, a Lenovo company.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:05.160]   Although to my knowledge, there is no snapfish on Motorola phones yet.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.440]   But I just got an email last week from a Motorola saying we'd like to send you a box.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:16.840]   And some barcode tool, 6 to 8 AM Pacific time, Wednesday the 25th today.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.080]   Your box will arrive.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:23.560]   And I think their hope was that people would have live unboxings all over the internet.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.840]   I wasn't going to rush in.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.360]   So I came in at my normal time and we opened up the box.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.840]   And this is what we got.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:30.040]   I think this is inspired.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.280]   I wish more companies would do this.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.920]   From a point of view of a tech journalist, what a wonderful thing.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.840]   So I open up the box.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.880]   And here's it says slide to start fragile.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.280]   It'd be great if it had a time run.
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   You really couldn't.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.280]   I know.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.280]   Do not open them.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.280]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:50.680]   Well, based on when it arrived, I guess there wasn't really that wasn't an issue because
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.840]   I couldn't open it until it arrived.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.840]   So you slide it open.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.320]   Actually, I'm sure it came out this way.
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:55:01.000]   And it said the new Moto E. So this is the second generation of Motorola's really inexpensive
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.960]   phone.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.320]   List price, 150 bucks.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.080]   And it was kind of cool.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.080]   It says start here.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.840]   So you open the flap.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.280]   And that actually in here were these.
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.960]   Put your hand in and something will bite it off.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:14.960]   I know.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:15.960]   Here were these bumpers.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.200]   This is one way you can customize it.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.040]   They have a variety of colored bumpers.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.360]   And then you flip this open.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.120]   I thought this was really cool.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.320]   Here's the welcome desk.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.800]   Oh, you also had a badge with your name on it.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.280]   My name on it said Motorola.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.240]   And so I already got my badge.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.800]   Thank you at the welcome desk.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:36.240]   And there's a so cool door.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.640]   And then you pull open the door and there's little seats for you and the other press to
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.520]   sit in.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.920]   And there's what's what's his name?
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.920]   Rick Osterlo.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:45.920]   Rick Osterlo.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.920]   Hey, Rick.
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.920]   He's a little Rick.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.520]   And there was a phone in here, which I've since taken out.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.280]   But that is so cute.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.280]   Thank you, Motorola.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.160]   What a great version.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.920]   The phone was getting very good notices today that they've done a lot.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   Here it is.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   Yes.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.920]   This is remarkable given.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.720]   Now, somebody said it was for sale.
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:09.960]   Let me unlock it because I think that's by might have leaked the price and information
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:10.960]   last week.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.120]   Somebody said it was for sale 120 bucks.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.320]   But that's for the 3G.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.320]   That's for the 3G.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.040]   OK, so this is the new one.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.040]   Full 4G.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.040]   It's a small screen.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.960]   It's a QHD screen, which is what 960 by 540.
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:29.120]   245 pixels per inch, which is small, but not tiny.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.880]   Now it's only eight gigs of storage.
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:34.760]   In fact, the first thing I had to do was take apps off because I, of course, it immediately
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.920]   auto installs everything.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.720]   And once you take apps off, but it's a good look in screen.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.400]   It's fairly, it feels fairly snappy.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:46.960]   It has, you know, OK, Google, the standard OK, Google.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.480]   It doesn't have a lot of the, a lot of the Moto stuff, but it does have the watch while
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.920]   you're driving.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.920]   It will--
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.920]   Moto Assist.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.920]   The Moto Assist.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.840]   Yeah, I really, I love that.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.840]   And it's supposed-- now, I don't know anything about battery life yet because I just got
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:05.960]   it, but it's a fairly hefty battery for a size, something this size.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.680]   Here's the, says meeting, have a productive meeting.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:11.040]   So we won't ring now because I'm in a meeting, which is awesome.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:15.200]   And it's Lollipop, and not only Lollipop, but clean Lollipop.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:20.880]   It is, it is effectively, you know, Google version.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.920]   Is there any, any Moto Wear on it at all?
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:26.560]   There's just the Moto apps that are needed to do assist.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.640]   And I think it probably has the Connect app, which a lot, or migration apps.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.640]   It's like a mini Nexus.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.640]   It's pure Google.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.640]   It's pure Google.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.640]   So in fact, for people who want to really cheap Nexus for development, this is a great
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   choice.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:43.640]   They're saying in the press kit, they say it's for first time phone, you know, buyers.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.560]   It's for kids.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.760]   This comes off and you can customize it.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:52.360]   There's a black version also and a variety of different colored little, these little colored
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.360]   things.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.360]   Oh, this is something nice.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.440]   Even though only a gig storage, it does support an SD card, micro SD card.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.440]   Oh!
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.440]   Why don't we get that?
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.440]   Huh?
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.440]   Why don't more phones be there?
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.440]   I think that's such a nice feature.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.840]   It's hard to do in the OS, but I think Google's figured it out now.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.400]   So if you wanted to store, it would be for more for music, not so much to give you more
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.400]   app storage.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:17.520]   So now I've made it a pink phone because I like pink.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.840]   I think this is for a first phone.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.600]   It's also a third world oriented.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:25.000]   They will be a dual SIM model and there is an FM radio in it.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.760]   I think that's something that's a big nation.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.760]   Yeah, it's a part of the value.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.760]   It's part of the value.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:34.240]   But for anybody who wants a cheap, unlocked phone price...
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.160]   I mean, you think about it.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:43.560]   Just remember back to our wonder of smartphones and what this costs, $129 for a phenomenal
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.560]   phone.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:50.360]   And also compare it to the prices being rumored for the new Samsung.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.920]   Over a thousand bucks, $1,000.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:53.920]   Unbelievable.
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.320]   I give Moto a lot of credit here.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.240]   I mean, they came out with this Moto E last year.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.920]   I got one sitting here as well.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.600]   Great little disposable phone.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   Absolutely.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.600]   Great backup phone.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.640]   They have a purple thing on yours.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.240]   Yeah, I put the purple band on there.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.080]   My little Rick Osterlo, he won't stand up.
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.360]   I don't know what happened in there.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.560]   He fell down.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:17.000]   But they added a front-facing camera, which last year's model did not have.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.600]   Five megapixels front and back.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:23.160]   No flash on the back, which is a little unfortunate, but that's okay.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.360]   You mentioned the Moto Assist.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.800]   It also has some of the notification stuff that the Moto X has.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   Yes.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.280]   You can't put your hand over it and have notifications appear.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.640]   There's no sensors for that.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:36.840]   But if you nudge the phone when it's sitting down and the screen is off, the screen will
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.080]   actually wake and show you your notifications.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.320]   So they're doing what they can with very limited hardware.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:47.960]   I mean, this is up to a quad-core chip compared to last year's dual-core chip inside.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.800]   It's a Snapdragon 400, 410, something like that.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:51.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.800]   Super fast.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.040]   You're gonna set the house on fire.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.160]   Last year's model actually only had four gig of storage.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:59.520]   So this is the eight gig is actually a doubling.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.480]   Really, it's almost the same price as last year plus it has LTE.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.520]   I think this is remarkable.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:09.520]   I think for a kid, it feels indestructible.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.000]   Gorilla Glass, very plastic-y.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.320]   But boy, it also somewhat water-resistant.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:19.440]   I feel like this is the kind of phone that somebody would give a kid or your first phone
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.160]   if you're in a budget constrained.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.240]   Yeah, cuckoodos to Motorola.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.360]   I think this is really pretty impressive.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.960]   Kevin, this is probably coming out of Chicago, not out of China.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.640]   I mean, the design and the accessibility and all of that.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   Well, it's hard to say.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.200]   I mean, if you look at it, you can see in the band that I have.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.800]   I mean, it looks like the Moto X design, which really originated back here.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.800]   So they're kind of...
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.800]   You get the dim.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.800]   I mean, it's the dimple and everything.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.200]   It's just a reuse of a very smart, elegant design.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.680]   It's a little bit of a chunky monkey because of that battery, but they say 24 hours of
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.920]   battery life to be expected.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.160]   See, that's remarkable.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:58.320]   I actually cast my Moto X aside in 2014 Moto X because I couldn't get through a day as
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.920]   much as I love it and I had to leather back and everything.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:06.400]   But if I can get all the features in the last of the day, this thing's compact.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.280]   This isn't a bad choice at all.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.440]   You could actually buy one of these outright for $149, never put a SIM card in it and
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.840]   just use it as a Wi-Fi Android iPod for...
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.840]   Right.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.840]   Unlocked.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.320]   Unlocked, unsubsidized price.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.080]   Well, then $129 because you don't need the 4G.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.080]   Right.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.080]   That's a good point.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.640]   Why did they release this before?
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:31.200]   Because there's going to be a lot of noise from Barcelona starting on Saturday.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.840]   And the best way to avoid that is to do exactly what they did.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.840]   They did, yeah.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.360]   Which is clever little box with the mini-Rick Osterlo in it.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.600]   And by doing that, they got our attention.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600]   Didn't they?
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:43.600]   Hi, Rick.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.600]   They did.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.080]   So, there's this like falling over?
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.200]   Yeah, like there's glue on the bottom, but my glue never sets.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.080]   So, Rick, I'm going to put him on my desk somewhere, I think.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.440]   I really like Rick.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.240]   And I really think...
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.360]   I hope Lenovo doesn't screw this company up as they have screwed IPOs.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.320]   Think bad.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.320]   Nice job.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.320]   Is the Think Bad bad?
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.920]   I mean, I know they don't screw it up super fish.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.760]   It does not have super fish.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:16.080]   It was only on the cheap consumer grade products that it has all that.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.040]   So, yeah, here's some masking tape in here.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.040]   The obviously...
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.040]   Oh, Rick Osterlo even has a back.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.040]   I mean, they went all...
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.040]   Oh my God.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   They said they could be in the end now, really?
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.480]   Yeah, in a match.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.720]   My phone's...
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.720]   Holy cow.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.720]   Ooh.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.720]   It changes everything.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.720]   It changes everything.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:34.720]   Really?
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   [Laughter]
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:42.400]   I love how this is kind of like thumbing their nose at the big...
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:47.760]   What's become a tradition now, which is just that in order to get attention, they feel
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.840]   like these companies feel like they need to throw these huge announcements filled with
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.960]   glamour and Broadway music and all this stuff.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.640]   Really, all you need is a clever campaign that's sent out at the right time, which in
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.960]   this case ends up being before Barcelona.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.920]   And they're going to get a pretty decent amount of awareness and coverage out of it.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.920]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   You know what else about that?
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   Is that if you go to...
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.920]   For the sake of Twit, I've gone to the Big Samsung event at Radio City.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:15.920]   Oh God.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:16.920]   Right.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:17.920]   Where number one was an awful event?
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.160]   Number two, they don't give away any phones.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:25.520]   Number three, I'll bet it cost five times what just giving away the phone and the cute box
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.520]   cost.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.520]   Right.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:31.000]   And I think they sent a lot of these to bloggers and people who probably can't afford to go to
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.240]   Barcelona, they don't want to go to Barcelona.
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:38.320]   So you get more attention by doing that.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.320]   Yeah, smart.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.840]   They're Moto X announcement this year, last year was in Chicago.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.640]   I think you need them on your shoulder, Leo.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.640]   I can do that.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.640]   Well, he can speak in your voice.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:50.640]   You're here.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.560]   Is it the good angel or the bad angel?
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.160]   That's a good question.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.840]   He's hanging on for dear life.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.480]   I can tell you that.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.200]   By the way, the Samsung phone, the S6 has a new form of payment.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.120]   Remember, they bought loop pay.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.960]   That's kind of an interesting technology.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.200]   Jeff Needles uses it.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.680]   It allows you to hover your phone over a swipe terminal.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.720]   The phone sends out a magnetic field, which is read as a real credit card being swiped.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:24.040]   So in other words, Samsung's pay will have touch to pay, but also this swipe capability,
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.720]   which will make it the most compatible.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:28.280]   That's going to work far better, I think, in Europe than here.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.440]   I don't think they swipe still in your own.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.440]   Well, would...
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.440]   No, you do the chip card.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.680]   I thought they did chip in pin.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.320]   But I think those terminals, when they come in a restaurant in Europe, they do sway at
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.160]   the table with a device.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.160]   It's like a...
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.520]   Well, it's pin, but I think they also have a swipe there.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:49.560]   I don't imagine you can hold up against that, but in the US, there's a hell of a lot of
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.680]   purchases, fortunes won't matter.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.360]   Well, swiping is going away, I think.
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.840]   How are you going to pay for a restaurant check?
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.280]   I mean, how are you going to do with those...
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.440]   Well, they just get these new touch terminals everywhere.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.760]   Yeah, well, that's a big deal.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.400]   Every restaurant, every waiter in the country.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.480]   They're mandated to.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.760]   I think they're mandated to.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.760]   This is all changing.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.520]   Is it that definite?
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.880]   So we're moving to chip and sign.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:18.840]   Instead of chip, by October of this year, no more swipe.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.480]   So there'll be a chip, but it won't be necessarily pin-based, you'll still maybe sign.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:27.520]   So that sounds like the waiter, if he comes to your table, will have a thing that you
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.160]   touch your...
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.400]   I'm getting a new American Express card.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.280]   It's on its way with a chip in it.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.720]   I think all your credit cards will be replaced in the next few months with chips.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.520]   I think NFC, right?
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.080]   You tap it and then it registers it.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.720]   Still may have to print out a receipt and sign it.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.680]   Although it doesn't mean you can't do chip and pin, it just means that they're giving
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.400]   them a little more time to get used to that notion.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.480]   So chip and sign, though, is by October.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.960]   And it may be chip and pin in many of the places you go.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:01.880]   So that's to fight fraud, although we'll see how well that fights fraud.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:06.600]   But that's why everybody and their brothers announcing these new payment systems, Samsung
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.120]   and Apple and everybody else, because...
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:15.200]   Walmart, because they realized that all of the terminals are going to be refreshed in
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.200]   the next six months.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.720]   This is a huge opportunity.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:18.720]   Real opportunity.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.720]   Everyone's trying to take advantage of it.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:28.000]   Android Pay even exists.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.120]   Now, it should tie in with Google Wallet.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:36.400]   Yeah, because that would get really confusing, which actually wouldn't be too surprising
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.400]   knowing Google.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:44.600]   But yeah, it's more like APIs for developers to allow developers to tie mobile payments
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.440]   like this into their apps and services.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.440]   They're not going to deprecate the wallet.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.360]   I'll still be able to use my wallet.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:54.160]   So, it will provide a secure store.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.280]   It will have an API.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.920]   Apps will determine when and where you can use payment cards.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:05.240]   The Google system will tokenize card numbers, much like Apple and Samsung pay do.
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.600]   That's one of the real advantages of these payment systems from the privacy point of
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.600]   view.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.880]   And a security point of view, you're not giving the merchant your credit card or any personal
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.120]   information.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:22.400]   It's actually a one-time token, which they can use to verify that you are paying this amount.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.760]   Google's Android Pay will use NFC for transmission.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.560]   It will support biometric authentication via hardware.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.280]   Oh, that's another thing on the S6.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:33.720]   They figured out a way to touch without swiping, touch ID fingerprint.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:38.240]   Right now, although I have to say I've gotten used to the note for and I'm pretty consistent
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.240]   on it.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.000]   But see, I just did it and said, no, no, you didn't, you did it a little sideways.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.200]   You have to do it just right.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.840]   I do like this and it does unlock Google Wallet, it unlocks LastPass.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:52.240]   So there already is a standard kind of API for the Samsung fingerprint reader.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.640]   But you don't want that works like Apple's where you just put your finger on it and it
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.800]   reads it and you're done.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.800]   Apple's works so well.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.800]   Yep.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.920]   But you know what, Leo, you know what, I don't want to my Nexus 6?
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.920]   A button.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.920]   Right.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:09.520]   Well, as a result, you have a physical button and this is why the iPhone is a physical button.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.520]   That's why Samsung.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.720]   It justifies Samsung's continued.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:13.720]   It does, yeah.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:14.720]   To the home button.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:15.720]   Right.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.400]   Maybe they knew.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:20.960]   So Pachai said that they're not trying to compete with Samsung's offering.
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:25.160]   It's just to give them another choice.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.360]   And I guess it will work with the Samsung fingerprint reader, which is cool.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.920]   No timeline.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.680]   I guess we'll find out more at Google I/O in May.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.640]   I am glad that they're stepping this up a little bit.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:39.400]   I mean, for a while, it was unsure, I was unsure, certainly.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.720]   I think a lot of people were, what was going to happen with Google Wallet?
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.240]   Was it just going to go away?
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.520]   I mean, I was really starting to wonder because I use Google Wallet whenever I can because it's
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.080]   more secure.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.480]   People ask me, why do you do that thing with your phone?
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.480]   Why don't you pay by credit card?
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.920]   And I tell them, I get there's a pin.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.680]   You know, I can revoke things very easily if someone gets my phone or something.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:01.600]   But I've been going to stores and it hasn't been working because stores are, I guess,
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.280]   not subscribing to the service anymore or whatever.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.960]   So I was getting really worried, but I'm really glad that they're stepping this up.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.720]   I'm glad that they bought ISIS or whatever it's called now.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.720]   Softcard.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.960]   Softcard, thank you.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.880]   Because I think that, and I think that they, I think the reason they did it was just because
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.600]   they got so worried with Apple Pay.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.760]   I think that kind of forced Google to go away.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.920]   Or they saw an opportunity.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.240]   I mean, I think that just as we said, this is the time.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:29.480]   If you're going to put your flag in the sand, this is the time to plan it.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.480]   Yep.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:36.640]   You know, while it was hurt because the carriers, chiefly Verizon, wanted to use Softcard, right?
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.240]   And said, well, we're not going to let you use Apple.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:42.160]   I mean, how many times have I installed Google Wallet or tried to on an Android device and
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.480]   it says your carrier does not support it?
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.480]   But that changed at some point.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.040]   Now everybody does, right?
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.280]   Have you had problems with Verizon?
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.800]   I have no problems, but I run a custom ROM.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.840]   So you wouldn't even know what you do.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:03.000]   Google actually specifically took it into their own hands and changed the way Wallet authenticated.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.360]   They fixed the secure elements, something along those lines, the details are a little shady,
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.840]   but they basically went around the carriers and said, okay, well, if you're going to block
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.280]   it there, then we're going to do it this way.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.080]   Well, whatever happened, I was real thrilled because suddenly my wallet was working and
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.520]   I put all my credit cards in there.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.520]   Right.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.720]   As far as I can tell, it's functionally identical to Apple Pay.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.880]   The only difference is the fingerprint reader.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.080]   I think it's great.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.600]   Use a pin instead of the fingerprint reader.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.600]   And now that's coming.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.920]   And everywhere that uses Apple Pay, it works because touch ID is touch ID, you know, or
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.920]   whatever it is.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.880]   Yeah, touch to pay is touch to pay.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.440]   So I'm not sure what's going on.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.040]   And this is not good because consumers need to know with some reliability what's going
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.960]   on.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.800]   Maybe that's why they almost feels like they've rebranded Google Wallet Android Pay in the
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.680]   same way they rebranded Google TV, Android TV.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.720]   Google likes to rebrand its things.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.080]   It's all Android, right?
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.280]   I think that's the more consumer friendly brand.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.280]   Right.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:06.680]   So I'm going to talk about, I have actually not one, but two new Chromebooks and Jeff,
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.320]   time for me to eat crow.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.800]   Oh, history book.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.000]   Well, you remember I was pretty dismissive.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   You've been nice.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.560]   We've been a shtick of that.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.800]   I've been dismissive of the Chromebook.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.240]   And a lot of people still are.
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:22.960]   They say, oh, it's just a browser pretending to be a computer.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.800]   But a few things have happened.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:27.800]   One is obvious.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.880]   It's become more and more capable over time.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.160]   There's more and more Chrome extensions.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.880]   There's now Chrome apps, which act pretty in fact, Chrome OS has become in many respects,
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.080]   a full blown OS.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.720]   You've got apps, you've got a toolbar and all that.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:45.640]   But what was missing, I think, was decent hardware, for me, Frank.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.280]   Most Chromebooks are $200 to $300.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.280]   They're junkie.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:50.280]   They're not.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.280]   They're not.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.280]   They're tinny.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:59.480]   So I now having played with the new Google, let me log into this before you show it.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:05.520]   I have a new mind set up so I can log in with my watch.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.520]   That is awesome.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:10.920]   If you have Android 5 on your device, your watch will do it.
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.920]   I mean, my phone.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.400]   God, if the watch did it, that'd be really awesome.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:22.000]   But if you have Android 5 on your smartphone, yeah, it'll just log in automatically.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.480]   The screen is spectacular.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.680]   As good as any retina air.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.160]   It's weird 3.2 still.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:34.960]   In fact, it's in any every way that's the same except Type C connector now, which I really
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.200]   like.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.200]   And there's two of them.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.000]   So you could put power on either side, video on either side, USB still there.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.760]   It still has an SD card slot, which is kind of a bad tease because I can't really do
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760]   anything with it.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.160]   I shoot raw so it doesn't--
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.400]   There's no point in putting a card in there.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.560]   Although it does mount flush, which means you could use this as extra storage.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.640]   You put 128 gig SD card in there.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.520]   That's like a second hard drive, if you wish.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:05.760]   I try to go to Best Buy and Apple to buy a C to HDMI connector.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.040]   And you can't get it.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.040]   Not yet.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.040]   Really?
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.200]   You can get it from Google, but you can't get it from Google.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.200]   Yeah, you can get them online.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.120]   And Apple sells a $79 dongle, which really is overpriced.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.080]   So there's a couple of needed accessories.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.920]   That's certainly one is cheap Type C interfaces.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.160]   And I'm sure Monoprice will do them because it's not proprietary.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.040]   It's not the MagSafe adapter.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.600]   Everybody, Intel, Google, and Apple all involve the Type C. It's a standard.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.400]   So as far as I can tell, I've been doing a lot of inquiries.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.680]   This is a standard, standard, standard.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.680]   Power and everything.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:43.160]   For instance, have a Type C power adapter from another manufacturer plug it in.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.480]   And it would work fine.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:51.320]   Even if the wattage isn't the same, it will trickle charge it or fast charge it or not
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.160]   use all the power available.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.680]   It'll work.
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.160]   The other accessory that's needed is Steve Gibson came up with this.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:01.080]   And if anybody wants to steal this idea and do a Kickstarter, I encourage you.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:08.240]   He says you need a Type C condom because there is this issue that Type C is not just power.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.600]   It's full USB data.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:16.040]   So the bad USB hack, which means that you can use this to modify the firmware on USB
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:23.320]   drives and make them very potent malware transportation devices, is a potential problem
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.320]   here.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:29.040]   If anybody could put a charging station in a coffee shop that would infect, now the good
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:32.240]   news about Chromebooks is you can't, there's nothing really to infect.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.240]   In fact, right.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.600]   These are very, very secure.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:39.800]   But nonetheless, certainly for the MacBook you'll want this, it would be simple enough
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:47.600]   to make a Type C male to female cable that just carried the power lines, not any of the
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.600]   data.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.600]   Oh, I see.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.600]   And you'd carry that with you.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.000]   You'd use that all the time.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.320]   Then you could safely connect to anything.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.480]   So that's a good market.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:58.240]   They shouldn't be more than a buck or two.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.680]   There's no special stuff in that.
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.280]   I'm figuring 59 bucks on from Apple before you know it.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:09.320]   By the way, it is March 18th today, Jason, just not March 9th.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.320]   Good catch.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.720]   I am really impressed with the keyboard, the screen, the trackpad.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:16.720]   Everything works very well.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.760]   The hinge is more solid.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.760]   The hinge was good before, but it's really good now.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.440]   And you don't mind the screen that it's 3, 2?
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.080]   It's weird, but you get used to it.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.480]   Yeah, it's fine for me.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.920]   One thing that has really improved in the Chromebook is the ability to handle different
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:31.920]   sized screens.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.520]   And I'll use that with this.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.120]   I'll use this as an example.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.260]   This came out today.
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:41.480]   This is a new Acer Chromebook with a 15 inch screen.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.440]   And one of the things that's made it hard for me to recommend Chromebooks to it's the
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.960]   natural users of Chromebooks are older people, right, who really don't need anything more
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.840]   complex than a browser and email program, things and stuff like that.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:53.840]   Chromebooks are perfect for them.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.840]   They just can't get in trouble with them.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.120]   But the screens have been so crappy and small, it's hard to recommend it.
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.280]   Even I have a hard time reading it.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:07.280]   Can you hide the screen real quickly while I log into my Google account on this?
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:10.960]   This one, I'll show you what I've done.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:18.600]   I've made that because you have 15 inches now, you can make this very easy to look at because
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.320]   you now have two things you can change.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:26.680]   You can change the standard browser zoom size and you can change the standard text size.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:30.960]   So it's not this small type problem of the other on HD Chromebook.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.600]   This is so easy to use.
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.080]   You see how big that, well, I can make it even bigger.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080]   See how big it is.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.520]   And on a 15 inch screen, which, you know, it's 1080p screen potentially these could be
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.720]   very small.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:47.520]   But they're actually quite usable, I think.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.360]   So I think Google has solved a lot of the kind of little things that-
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.000]   And how much is that, Acer?
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   300 bucks.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   Amazing.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.480]   So I've customized the fonts to be very large, but you can even go more in here.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.880]   You can change the kind of font.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:08.760]   There's a lot of information there you can use to your heart's content to make it legible.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:12.520]   And then you can set the standard page in which I've set to 150% on here, just kind
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.320]   of as example.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:20.640]   Now, some of the icons on the Chrome, the user interface are still small, but usable.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.800]   And it's not touch.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.760]   It's not nearly as good a screen as the Pixel.
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:31.280]   The thing that's great about the Pixel is it feels so fast, so fluid, so easy, and
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:36.640]   this isn't even the LS version, that you kind of, some of the kind of qualms about using
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640]   a Chromebook go away.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.600]   It feels like it's a real computer.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.600]   Mm-hmm.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.600]   The beat is already amazing.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.360]   I got the LS.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.360]   You did?
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.360]   There we go.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.360]   Both.
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.360]   Okay, so the Acer is my only machine.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.160]   I might as well, you know, that's where I live with.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.160]   Right.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.160]   Why not?
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.160]   200 bucks, 300 bucks more.
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:56.280]   The Acer boots in seven seconds, this thing, I mean, it makes us do a reboot.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.760]   It feels like it's almost instant, right?
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.760]   Well, what's so great to you mentioned this last week too is the setup is nothing.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.760]   Every time I have to change the machines, it's always a day of this.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.240]   I forgot that.
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.120]   And you turn it on and give it about four minutes and it's done.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.400]   So let's see how fast it takes to boot.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.040]   I just shut it off.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.400]   Just tap one thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, one thousand four.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.400]   Did I tap it?
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.400]   No, he didn't shut off yet.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.160]   It takes a second to shut off.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.160]   Okay.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.160]   Is it off?
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.200]   How do you even know?
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.920]   No light on the front.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.720]   One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.800]   I love the screen back on one thousand.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.800]   That's it.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:35.800]   Mm-hmm.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.080]   That almost instant, like four or five seconds.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.520]   This is kind of fun too.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.960]   The rainbow little do it here.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:49.080]   You double tap it and you can see how much battery life is left, which is great.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:53.800]   So I'm a hundred percent charged and the battery life, you haven't experienced this yet, Jeff.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.480]   Nine to twelve hours easy.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.120]   Oh, really?
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.120]   So it's legit.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.200]   Oh, it's legit.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.000]   And same thing with this Acer because it's so big.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   It's all battery in the insides.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   Right.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   That is fabulous.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.880]   These are heavier than errors.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.880]   That's the one thing.
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.880]   They're not, you know, it's getting a good answer.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.360]   But it feels like something, it's a utilitarian.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.360]   Air.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.360]   Solid.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.560]   Square edges, you know, it's very googly.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.960]   I love it.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.320]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.320]   Wow.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.320]   I think you're going to like yours a lot.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.960]   I mean, I'm curious what you say with the ludicrous speed version.
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:26.960]   The only thing.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.160]   Go ahead, Beth.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.160]   Sorry.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.600]   There's nothing you want to do on a computer that you can't do on there.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.600]   Yeah, there's a few things.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.160]   I like to do computer programming.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.680]   I can't do most kinds of computer programming.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:42.360]   You can do App Inventor and stuff like that web-based programming, but I can't do the
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.360]   stuff I want.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.000]   When you can do a board, you can do a board too.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.040]   Not do a board, but do a build too.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.480]   I played with Linux on this.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.200]   I decided not to do that.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.520]   The one thing I have done, I have SSH on here.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:20:00.440]   And so the one thing I have done is I can SSH to my Linux box and have a Linux command
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.080]   line easily.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.080]   Right.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:09.160]   So, Matthew, the only thing is you don't edit video on it.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.440]   Can't video or photo.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:15.840]   I mean, you can, but you can't do what Leo does with his raw files on photo before I
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:21.160]   do for, you know, let me get a photo for a medium post, easy as pie.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.720]   You can also use remote desktop.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:27.600]   So I'm going to remote desktop into my Mac Pro at home.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.760]   And don't look.
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.120]   You have a security pin, which I'm just entered.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.560]   And now I can use my computer at home.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.520]   Is it one, two, three, four?
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.720]   Shoot, you saw.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.400]   You saw.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.760]   So I'm having some screen issues, but this is probably because I have my computer at
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.040]   home set a ridiculous screen resolution.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:53.960]   But basically this is, I'm, that's my computer at home I'm looking at.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:57.040]   This screen is my Mac Pro.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:02.720]   So you can, in fact, I guess do what you want.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:08.080]   But I think if you had, I think what you need is a desktop that can do all that stuff.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.080]   And then this could be your, your notebook.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:20.160]   I mean, listen, I think when you, when you get, if I had Google fiber at full speed, you
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.800]   start to see doing video remotely.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:29.240]   There is a remote video plugin, you know, video, we video will do video editing.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:34.760]   And listen, it's always taken time to download the video to the machine, just upload it to
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:36.040]   the cloud instead.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:40.560]   And as long as you can get response there and, and the rendering is going to be faster up
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.800]   in the cloud than it is going to be on the local machine.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.720]   As more stuff uses HTML5 as Chrome gets more powerful, I love this little app drawer.
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:51.680]   And by the way, you get this on Windows and Mac now to where you have what look, I mean,
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:56.160]   just for all intents and purposes, this looks like the task bar on Windows with all my icons
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.160]   here.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160]   Wash your mouth out.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.200]   Well, I mean, it's, or okay, the dock.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.480]   You have a start button where you have, you know, these are the apps I have.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.480]   I can swipe through them, which is great.
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:14.320]   And these, you know, I, you know, it's pretty much everything I want.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.680]   The speakers on this are pretty decent still.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.120]   I think the old pixel had very good speakers.
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:20.200]   These are still pretty good here.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:24.960]   And there is a lot of, you know, image editing and even sort of minor video editing that
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.960]   you can do in the cloud.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:36.200]   You know, it's not like my, my tweet deck app was great, you know.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:40.200]   Anyway, you get this assumed it would be all about the bass.
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.200]   Oh, I can play that.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:47.680]   I hate that song.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:53.520]   So I think in general, this is, this is like 90% of what most people do with their computing
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.520]   anyway.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.360]   100% in some cases.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.400]   You can play Pac-Man.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:03.640]   If you just go to your maps.google.com, you can play Pac-Man in your hometown.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.920]   I'm playing it in Petaluma.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:10.040]   Uh oh, quickly before Blinky gets to me, run for the river Pac-Man.
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.000]   Oh, I just went, I don't know where I am.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   Oh yeah.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   You go off the edge.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   That's right.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.760]   Oh, it is kind of brilliant.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:17.760]   Isn't it?
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.040]   And listen to the sound, Trump, the sound.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.040]   I've got the sound up.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:21.960]   I don't know why I'm not there.
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.360]   I heard that.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.440]   That's not the sound you want.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:29.640]   Why are not sound is returned to good?
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.640]   Huh.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:31.640]   Oh, here it is.
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:32.640]   That little thing.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.640]   There we go.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.200]   Oh, now, now how do you feel?
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.200]   Do you have to license that sound?
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.720]   Sure they did.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.880]   I mean, it's it's Google.
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:44.280]   It's exactly the sound.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.280]   Namco licensed it.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:24:08.560]   Oh, it's like an AY3
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.560]   910 chip.
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.560]   It's just one of the four things it can do.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.560]   Oh yeah, you know what?
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:13.560]   That's probably a good point.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:16.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:24.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:25.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.560]   I think it's a good point.

[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:45.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:47.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:50.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:51.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:55.560]   I think it's a good point.

[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:02.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:03.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:04.560]   I think it's a good point.

[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:15.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:16.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:18.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:19.560]   I think it's a good point.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:25.320]   It's invitation only at the moment because it's really broken and early and working on
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.320]   it.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.080]   If you are interested and you want in and you're listening to the show, just tweet at me and
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:36.080]   tell me that you heard about it on Twig and I will get you in there.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.080]   Here's what it says.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.080]   You make great things.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.360]   Tell the world what you made.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:42.280]   It's for app creators.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.840]   Yeah, it's for digital creators.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:50.680]   Not just apps, games, podcasts, shows, anyone that's making any piece of digital culture.
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.200]   So we would not account.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.200]   You would absolutely count.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:54.200]   Oh, good.
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.920]   It's about projects and makers, not companies, not titles.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.400]   We're talking about digital things and they're makers.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.920]   And by maker, I don't mean coder.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:03.920]   I mean everything.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.520]   I mean, we mean everything.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.000]   Designers, writers, project managers, legal help.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   Investors.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.760]   Everyone that who helped bring an app that you love to fruition, we want to capture.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:17.680]   And then what will we get out of this?
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:20.440]   Is it going to be like a crunch base for makers or?
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.160]   Yeah, you know, some people have made that comparison.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:27.480]   I mean, one of our lofty goals, and this is me and my co-founder, Anil, at ThinkUp,
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:30.440]   you know, this conversation we've had is like, there's always like a point in your career
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.680]   where you like talk to that person where you kind of like, you get your big break, like
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.240]   somebody takes a chance on you or, you know, gives you, gives you a job or, or, or sparks
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.200]   an idea in you and that that's kind of when your career takes off.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:47.280]   So our idea is like, if we can make the credit role behind the apps that you love transparent,
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:50.360]   you know, if we can have the liner notes for apps, just like, you know, CDs have them with
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:55.160]   IMDB for apps, the way that movies has them, that I'll make it easier for people to say,
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:58.320]   oh, how do you know, who do I need to talk to to find out more about how this happened
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.880]   or who are the people that work together a lot?
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.400]   Like you'll see these kind of power couples or power teams go through several, you know,
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:09.000]   projects like Evan Biz, you know, we'll go through audio and medium and blogger and,
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.840]   you know, and, and Twitter.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:15.680]   So we want to kind of make that we want to make the network of, of, of creators, of makers
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:21.400]   kind of transparent to help people, you know, see the faces behind, you know, what we made
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:26.520]   and honestly to help, you know, for underrepresented folks to find their pathways in and make those
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.520]   big breaks happen.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.840]   To put it in my terms, it's bylines.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:32.400]   Yeah, it's bylines, exactly.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.840]   Here's, here's Gina at presume you made this entry.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840]   I did.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.840]   I did it.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.840]   Everything is editable by everybody.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.000]   So the show's like a Wikipedia too.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000]   It's like Wikipedia.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   The show counts.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.840]   The show is a project for sure.
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:47.840]   Yep.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:48.840]   Medium count.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   You're writing on medium, Jeff.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.160]   I think I added medium for you.
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:56.200]   And then each person has a role in a project and a role could be like, you know, I made
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.320]   a suggestion on how to make the logo better and the role could be, I founded it, you know,
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:06.640]   there's there's like, yeah, I just say, yeah, my latest chapter from the book on medium
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.840]   that was not meant to be a plug.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:14.000]   Sorry, is about what I think I talked about on the show is what I call credit right rather
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.200]   than copyright.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.600]   The need to give credit to people for whatever deal may come down the pike in this in the
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.240]   string of create a collaborative creation online.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.680]   And this is this is a start to that.
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.640]   That's really, really important.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:30.200]   I think it's a directory though, essentially.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.200]   Mm hmm.
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:36.480]   And a opens directory.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:42.960]   There's also doesn't didn't Mozilla have a similar kind of open database of stuff.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.960]   This is good.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.960]   I like this a lot.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.400]   There are a lot of projects like there's this like angel list and geek list and dribble.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.080]   I mean, there's a lot of communities for people who do particular things, but this is very
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.840]   maker and project focus.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.200]   So tell me who made super and what that was like.
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:01.440]   And eventually we like to add like Q and A and you know, like that idea.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.440]   And it's really cool.
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.440]   Like we showed this to to have Williams actually and we'd added him as like the founder of
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.960]   Blogger and you can see the edits that people make to their own page.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:12.560]   So he actually edited his role in Blogger to add that he had written some code.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.560]   Oh, I actually wrote the code.
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:16.560]   Right.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.200]   He's a billionaire and he really wanted to get in there that he had written some like
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:21.760]   ASP, you know, like very funny.
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.640]   Where did you get this avatar of me?
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:27.800]   Okay, so everything right now we're doing auto fills from Twitter primarily.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:31.160]   So that so when I made this entry for you, this is good.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.520]   That's why I've changed my Twitter avatar.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:37.760]   So yeah, you can click on the edit button anywhere and change and change that.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:38.760]   So that's your roles.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:43.240]   If you go to your page, yeah, put that there and there's an edit button on the top right
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.240]   there.
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:46.160]   And again, this is really.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.800]   Avatar URL can be different.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.800]   Got it.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.720]   Yeah, we have to make obviously uploading or changing images a little bit, a little bit
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.720]   nicer than you.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.520]   Yeah, especially that image.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.840]   That was my Twitter handle Twitter image for a brief period of time.
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:03.480]   Then people explained to me it looked like I was dying in a vat of acid or something.
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.360]   It's an amazing photo.
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.640]   I'm not I'm not vain.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.640]   Let's put it that way.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:11.280]   I don't know about you.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:16.320]   Because that is not a flattering picture of me there.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.040]   All right, I'll fix that.
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:20.040]   But this is cool.
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.040]   I love this idea.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.600]   I love this all from scratch.
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.600]   I did.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   I did.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.840]   Yeah, we were using a bunch of code from from think up and that framework that I've written
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:31.520]   when we learned a lot of lessons from think up and we want to make the data entry as you
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.640]   know, we want to make it fun, right?
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.360]   Because we don't want to give people a job to set up yet another resume.
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:39.880]   But we want this to sort of differentiate itself enough from LinkedIn and from those
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.960]   kind of other networks to make it worthwhile.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:45.200]   We want this to be the place where people go to see the liner notes for an app.
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.200]   Nice.
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.200]   I love that you have these geno touches.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.680]   Roll raised porn.
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:54.920]   There's a definite geno sense of whimsy.
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:56.920]   Swimsy.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.160]   I like I like writing goofy coffee and then somehow it doesn't get caught.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:05.560]   I hope you go with a bunch that just go in there like, you know, or to the tacos.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.760]   Or to the tacos is.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.000]   Oh, that's a good one.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.320]   They're the tacos.
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.000]   I'm the taco orderer.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000]   Brought the donuts.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   Complained incessantly.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000]   Added bugs.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000]   Heard a cash.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000]   Yes.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000]   I'll see if I can find it.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.800]   See if I can find it better.
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:21.800]   It is totally.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.440]   Here's my this is going to be my new avatar photo.
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.440]   I think what do you think?
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.160]   Oh, you are beautiful woman.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.160]   I have to talk.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.160]   That is some great.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:33.720]   I have never seen that's a great photo.
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.120]   A lot of work went into that.
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:37.680]   No, this is actually actually it's very cool.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:42.280]   Lori Al makes a an iOS app that puts makeup on you.
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:43.280]   Oh, what it is.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.280]   This is done.
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.720]   What your wife was tormenting you.
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.840]   No, this is done programmatically.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:51.760]   She just said hold still and it's actually kind of amazing.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:54.640]   She did the same thing to herself, but there's no that one's not.
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:58.080]   That was a little obviously creepy.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.160]   This is this is me.
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:01.160]   That's this is creepy too.
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:04.240]   You know, it is so well done.
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.240]   The shadows and the dark.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.240]   It looks real.
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.840]   I'm sure that Lisa had like pinned you down and did make up.
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.840]   I know.
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:17.360]   I'm going to save the image and make it my my my my you are my new Twitter handle.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.360]   Twitter profile.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.360]   Isn't that great?
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.360]   All right.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.600]   So nice nice job on that.
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:25.280]   Let me go back to the this was a 20% you said.
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.280]   Make your base here.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:27.680]   Yeah, this was a 20% thing.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.680]   What does that mean?
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:32.680]   Well, you know, we were slogging through some like back end projects around payments and
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:36.880]   the Facebook API changes that think up and honestly it was it was hard and so the we did
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.280]   make our bases kind of a productive distraction.
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.280]   We did Fridays.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.280]   We'll go to the bar Gina.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.280]   Yeah, let's write some more code.
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:45.280]   What do you say?
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:46.280]   Geez.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:48.600]   This is a Neil's idea.
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:52.960]   He had this idea in 2011 and he talked about it back then and I remember feeling this twinge
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.320]   of oh, I really want to work on that and but we were too busy.
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:59.920]   We were too busy with think up and finally I said to him, listen, let's let's just build
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.920]   this thing.
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:01.920]   It was his idea.
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:02.920]   He talked to a bunch of people about it.
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:06.520]   A few people had actually started it and never shipped and I was like, let's just do it.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:09.040]   So yeah, this was our this was our Friday fun day.
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:10.040]   Amazing.
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:14.040]   And it's fairly it looks it seems very stable and fast and reliable.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.040]   From your mouth to the.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.040]   Yeah, it's really good.
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:18.920]   I mean, it's a way of jacie and things Leo.
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:19.920]   Don't forget.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:21.240]   You know what?
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:24.360]   We've just sent a thousand people there easily.
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:28.200]   Yeah, it's handling the traffic very smoothly.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:29.440]   What's your back end?
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.840]   Oh, this is a straight straight up lamp stack.
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.040]   You don't run your own servers though.
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:39.560]   No, we've got on the Linno box this this particular one one AWS would think up but we have our
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.460]   staging kind of play play sandbox servers on Linno and we actually put the maker based
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:44.460]   on Linno.
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:47.640]   So yeah, it's it's perfectly fine.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:48.760]   Like I said, it's invitation only.
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:52.040]   So people who are going to it who don't have sign and rights are just giving us their Twitter
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.040]   credentials.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.960]   So there's not a lot of not a lot.
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:58.720]   That's probably why we haven't brought it down yet.
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:05.040]   But you know, this is great because if you love Gina Trapani, you could come here and just
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.400]   like you would on IMDB, you'd see every movie that somebody was in.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:12.400]   You'd see all the products that projects that Gina's worked on in the days.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:16.140]   It's not exactly a resume in fact, because these are all direct links, right?
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:17.980]   So that's pretty cool.
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:21.300]   It's kind of also a GitHub for non goodies.
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:25.580]   Yes, you know, this is this is my frustration is that there are all these communities for
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:28.620]   coders, but I just, you know, we want everybody to learn to code and I think that that's a
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:29.620]   good idea.
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:33.540]   But I don't I've really come to this place where I realize that being a coder like doesn't
[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:37.060]   necessarily mean that you're the one creating creating this stuff, right?
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.060]   You know what I mean?
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:41.980]   Like there's so much more to coding apps and games and and to create a coder that's generous
[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:42.980]   of you.
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:46.560]   Yeah, I mean, as a coder, I'm really just a little more.
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.400]   People think I have some sort of superpower.
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:52.720]   It's like I have this idea and if I only go to that, I could make it happen.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.320]   Coding is super power.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.440]   Look at this.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:00.480]   You made this and you may fairly quickly, I'm guessing.
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:03.320]   I just that's that's a superpower.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:04.480]   That's a hell of a superpower.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:09.320]   But without writers and designers and even people to do your privacy policy and logo.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:12.560]   I mean, there's just there's so there's so much else that goes into it.
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.560]   Right.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:14.760]   And you know, like, did you know that this was PHP?
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:18.360]   Like, you know, there's part a good product sort of make the technology behind them invisible
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.520]   and I think that that takes a you know, a different skill set.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:25.520]   So you should say that because we were talking about app camp for girls yesterday on the
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:30.720]   Mac break weekly and a Kelly Goumont who's a counselor there.
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.440]   They may have they have an app that just came out, but she said that's one of the things
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.960]   that the girls learn at app camp is you don't have to be a coder.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.680]   They need you need designer you need all these people.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.000]   It's no application is just some person writing code.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.840]   No, the real skill to teach is going to be working in teams.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:49.280]   I mean, that's that's what we'll see about journalism is that we don't work in teams.
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.280]   We are lone wolf.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.000]   We should play more world of Warcraft.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.760]   Oh, that would teach you.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:58.640]   I mean, there's there is this like lone wolf kind of mythology around coders as well.
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:35:59.800]   And that's true.
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:03.240]   And that's not I that's not it's it's about your ability to get the right people together
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.240]   and collaborate and lead.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.240]   Right.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:09.680]   Most founders sure have did some ASP coding on blog early on, right?
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.200]   But most founders do you know, they wear lots of different hats and I think there's a
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:17.560]   lot of invisible aspects to do an app having said that you should all learn LISP right
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.560]   now.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:26.880]   M A K E R B A dot S E. That's not hard to it's just it's just what I would say with a Swedish
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.880]   accent make your base.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:29.880]   Make your face.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:30.880]   Make your face.
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:35.920]   All our all our Swedish viewers and we have quite a few are just hating us right now.
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.040]   How do you get a dot SE?
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.840]   You just go to the Sweden Nick and.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.840]   Oh, I think we I'm pretty sure we just used hover.
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:46.680]   You have to submit some little extra paperwork that that you don't for a dot com.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:51.280]   I forget any more have to be in that country to use the country code and no, you don't.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:54.840]   I think you have to submit like the tax number of the organization or something.
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:57.200]   I hope you don't get a Swedish tax bill now.
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.440]   You might get a Swedish tax bill.
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.520]   You're doing business in Sweden.
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:03.520]   Oh geez.
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.320]   Oh, it's okay.
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:10.640]   Because they've got great health care there.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.200]   And wonderful hearing and great song.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.200]   I love Sweden.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.200]   I love Sweden.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.200]   I adore.
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:17.200]   I love it.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.360]   And you're going to Finland, which I also I'm Scandinavia is great.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:20.360]   But it's very different.
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:24.400]   You know, the Finnish do not consider themselves, you know, part of that Scandinavian Norway,
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.480]   Sweden, Denmark thing.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.480]   There's be Korean.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.560]   There are it's a yeah, well, it's a Russell.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.400]   It's a very different language.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.680]   And yeah, it's like Korean.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:37.960]   Which is really bizarre when you say that.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:40.000]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.600]   I am really close now.
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.720]   I held off ordering the gear VR.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:45.760]   I have a Samsung Galaxy S6.
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:50.480]   But I think now I'm going to order it because it's more comfortable than cardboard.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.000]   It has a strap on.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.000]   One thing it's a strap on so you can leave it on.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000]   I shouldn't.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.840]   Oh, my doorbell's ringing.
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.440]   I hate it when that happens.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:05.760]   I am a little too wired now.
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:10.920]   But I think that the, you know, I've kind of come around on the VR thing.
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:11.920]   And it's funny.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:12.920]   It's cardboard that did it.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:13.920]   Not Oculus, really.
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:14.920]   Yes, that's right.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:15.920]   Yes.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.200]   It's the VR for the people and the augmented reality for the people because it's going
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.200]   to.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.280]   And I think one of the coolest things that they showed at the event, Google I/O during the
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:29.800]   keynote, was this new program to get cardboard into schools.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:30.800]   Yes.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:34.360]   It's such a perfect solution because it's not like, you know, Apple's plan to get iPads
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:37.600]   into schools so that every school has to pay 600 for whatever dollars.
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:38.600]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.600]   It's cheap.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.480]   Cardboard's cheap, but what's driving it and the reason it's cheap is you still need
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.480]   a smartphone.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.480]   Yes.
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:46.480]   You do the world.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:47.480]   Where's that kids all got them now?
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:50.480]   They, you know, it's like, oh, no, no, no, no, kids don't all got them.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:53.240]   And especially below sixth grade in K through six.
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:56.960]   Well, what they showed was boxes that had the smartphones in them.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:58.920]   So I'm guessing that people, you know, people will don't.
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.920]   They cost the same as an iPad.
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:03.440]   Well, it depends on what phone you get, right?
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:06.600]   I mean, they're definitely less expensive options.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.600]   What's the minimum?
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.600]   What's the minimum?
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:09.600]   Well, no, they are.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.200]   Well, I had bought my, you don't need a phone connection.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.920]   You're on Wi-Fi at school.
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:16.920]   Okay.
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:18.920]   So you could get what, what, what then?
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.920]   What's the second answer?
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:23.920]   I had Android one for under 100 bucks.
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.920]   100 bucks.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:28.880]   And I'm sure that, I mean, you said that kids under the age of, you know, but, you know,
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:35.040]   I've been reading a lot of stuff lately that shows that in the United States, at least,
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:40.000]   a huge percentage of even sixth graders have phones and carry them every day to school.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.840]   And so it'll be one of those things where they'll say, okay, who's got their own phone?
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:43.840]   Okay.
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:47.760]   Who doesn't have a phone and then they can pass out the school's phones for this purpose?
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:54.480]   But the benefit is that is, as they, as they talked about in the presentation, is it's
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:59.240]   a way to get kids really super engaged to actually immerse them in the content that
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:02.480]   they're talking about rather than just sitting, they're listening to a teacher go on and on.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:05.320]   I think the value is massive.
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:08.480]   And the additional cost, I think, can be very, very low.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:11.720]   Of course, Palo Alto school district will spend a fortune on brand new phones for all
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:12.720]   of them.
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:13.720]   That's kind of my point.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:14.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:15.720]   It's, this happens all the time.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.680]   The tech community gets all excited, puts hardware into schools or, you know, sets us
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:22.320]   kind of stuff up and says, hey, see, see you later.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.320]   Bye-bye.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.320]   And there's no curriculum.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.320]   There's no training for the teachers.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:29.120]   And in this case, there's this assumption that everybody's got an Android smart or high-end
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.120]   smartphone.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:33.880]   I think they'd all have to be school-issued because the teacher is controlling them from
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:34.880]   the tablet, right?
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:36.880]   So they've all got to be school-issued for this to be anything.
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:38.720]   This is not a cheap thing you're talking about here.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:42.760]   If they roll this out well, they're going to, they're going to focus on lower income.
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:43.760]   The kids really need it.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:44.760]   Right.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.000]   You know, I mean, so I hope we're going to see things like donors choose and we're going
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000]   to see other programs.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.320]   Hopefully Google's going to throw money.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:54.640]   It's, you know, places other than, you know, Palo Alto and figure out ways to help people.
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:56.840]   Google has a very compelling argument in the schools.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:02.960]   I mean, the Chromebook is, of course, the best way to put a computing platform in a school.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.520]   But I'm not, you know, everybody focuses on the fact that it's just the viewer is cheap.
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:09.960]   Well, but I think the viewer is just a holder, right?
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.480]   But the way to look at this, I think, is that the alternative to something like Google
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:21.360]   cardboard, the alternative to low-cost VR and augmented reality is nothing.
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:23.000]   It's not going to get cheaper than this.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.200]   In order to do VR, you have to have a good display.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:27.960]   You have to have some sort of connection.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.920]   You have to have all the things that a smartphone has.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:35.600]   And there's no, there are very few industries that have the economies of scale, entire industries,
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:40.840]   entire countries that have built, that have built industries around making all that stuff
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.880]   super, super cheap.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:48.520]   And so it's just, it's basically the only alternative argument to, if the argument is
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:52.920]   that this is too expensive, then virtual reality has no place in schools.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.360]   Well, that may be another argument.
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.360]   It's the cheapest virtual reality you can get.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:59.360]   Well said, Mike.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:02.800]   So a rubber waiting pool would also be the cheapest pool you could get.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.320]   It doesn't necessarily mean that this belongs to the schools.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:10.480]   And there's this whole additional thing of, okay, so you've got, okay, let's say you've
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:14.280]   figured out a way to get all the kids cardboard, now you've got to get the teacher a tablet
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:16.240]   and you've got to get curriculum associated with it.
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:19.880]   You know, remember the LA Unified School District said they were going to put an iPad
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:21.640]   in the hands of every student.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:24.800]   They made a deal with Pearson to develop curriculum.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:27.280]   And it's been a horrible failure.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:31.000]   They're suing both Apple and Pearson.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.240]   The curriculum wasn't developed.
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.800]   The teachers weren't trained.
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:37.840]   Most of these iPads ended up in the back of the classroom unused.
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.760]   I, it kind of makes me mad because I think Silicon Valley and, and we tech enthusiasts
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:46.400]   love this idea of tech in schools, but we don't follow through.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.960]   We don't go the whole distance on it, you know?
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:49.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:51.960]   That's true.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:54.440]   You know, another thing here at the Leo is that if you look at an elementary school,
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.720]   it's not like every classroom needs a setup.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:57.720]   Right.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.720]   One setup for an entire school.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:00.720]   You're buying one per class.
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:01.720]   Right.
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:02.720]   You're buying a team about one per class.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.160]   And, you know, Paulson just gave $400 million to Harvard.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.520]   The last school on the earth that possibly needs it.
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:11.520]   No, I agree.
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:14.160]   I'm not saying the school is probably the least of the problem.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:16.160]   I don't want to say this is the first thing to buy at all.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:17.160]   I agree with that too.
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:19.600]   Museum of Natural History was at IO.
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:21.400]   They did one of the explorations.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.040]   You know, I'm going through the same thing in news.
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:28.040]   People are going gaga over VR and I'm saying, well, hold on.
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:29.680]   It really hasn't had any impact yet.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:33.440]   We really have, you know, it's, it's the, yes, it's the latest new shiny toy.
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:36.160]   What's its real value going to be under turban?
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:38.480]   Nonetheless, yes, we go gaga.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:40.480]   We see that's cool.
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:41.480]   I'm excited.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.920]   I want to build a jump camera.
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:45.040]   That's the 16 GoPro or 16.
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:50.240]   It doesn't have to be GoPros, but that's the demo 16 camera rig that GoPro will sell,
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.880]   but you could also build yourself and then the jump software assembles it.
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:57.880]   And I, if my sense is you could do this in real time, which means I could say to our
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:01.000]   audience, watch live, you can download the show later.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.720]   But if you'd like to watch live as if you're in the studio with us, we have set up one
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:10.160]   of these rigs right where you would be sitting and now you can look around and participate.
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:11.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:14.200]   You can imagine a whole different kind of talk show.
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.760]   Where it's not just a camera going one level.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.440]   It's that you're in the middle of a, of, of couches of a discussion.
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.440]   Right.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:26.560]   You know, we look around as people talk.
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.560]   That's cool.
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.800]   Imagine, imagine a round table like, like the kind that Alex Lindsey built for other purposes
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:35.160]   for conversations and you have it in the middle of the table.
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:36.840]   Yeah, we could do that.
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:38.960]   And, and, and that's the, yeah, wouldn't that be great?
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.440]   And then you hear somebody talking over here.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.000]   So you turn it this way and so on.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000]   That's very cool.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.840]   By the way, Dr. Mom's saying, Oh, great.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:46.440]   Twitt's going to now make me barf.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:51.520]   Believe me, I get nauseous with the Oculus Rift.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:52.520]   Absolutely.
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:56.320]   I've never gotten nauseous with a non-sure why with cardboard.
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:01.280]   But I think it's because you're not, you're not moving and the thing isn't, it's not,
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.760]   you don't have this situation you didn't rift where you're not moving physically, but
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:06.320]   you're moving virtually.
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:08.240]   That is disorienting the inner ear.
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:09.240]   That is what makes you nauseous.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.640]   I think there's also latency issues.
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:18.160]   I'm sure that that's not necessarily solved in cardboard, but I don't, I never was bothered
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:20.240]   by it partly because too, because you can just go like this.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:22.240]   Right.
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:23.240]   And you don't, you're not going to really say spend hours.
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:24.240]   You're not playing a game.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:26.040]   The games are what makes you nauseous, frankly.
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.040]   That's right.
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:30.480]   Thank you, Matt, for putting this in here.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.480]   This was from the Google, Google research.
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.480]   Oh, Jason did this?
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:34.480]   All right.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:35.480]   Google research blog.
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:37.720]   It's talking about neural networks.
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:43.080]   Neural networks are a form of artificial intelligence computer software that learns the way you teach
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:46.120]   it is just feed it stuff, feed it lots of stuff.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:50.400]   And in this case, these neural neural networks which are attempting to simulate the human
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:55.440]   brain is being fed images.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:59.800]   And actually, this is quite a good conversation of how this works.
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:05.000]   Image classification, speech recognition are two very big areas where neural networks
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.560]   are being used to try to, you know, get better at this.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:17.640]   And there's some really cool images in here of, I don't know, what are these, Matt, would
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.600]   you explain what I'm looking at?
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:24.640]   Well, you basically try to train a neural network, a deep neural network to recognize
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:29.440]   specific things, whether it be ants or antelopes or dumbbells.
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:34.240]   And then you can turn it on its head and have the network sort of amplify things or
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:41.760]   given one image kind of take that and sort of build on it and then it becomes self-reinforcing.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:49.440]   And so you're looking for the platonic ideal of fork or ant or parachute or banana.
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:53.920]   And then you can feed it back into itself and then once it sees a little bit of a fork,
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:56.040]   it turns it into more of a fork.
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:01.280]   And so before you know it, you get this macro-level structure like a dog on one end and a fish
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.280]   on the other end.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:06.920]   It actually looks like an object, you know, because it could be plausible.
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.840]   And it's funny because a lot of people on Google were reading the comments on Reddit
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:15.560]   and Reddit was sort of saying, "This is exactly what acid looks like, man."
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:21.880]   Well, there's something to be, there's not merely a stoner talk in there.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:25.160]   That's kind of what happens when your brain doesn't organize information very well because
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:26.160]   it's drugged.
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:29.520]   Well, that's what the neural network kind of is like.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:30.520]   This is your Google.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.680]   This is your Google on drugs.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:36.600]   So there might be actually some learnings about how the visual cortex works.
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:43.120]   How it processes stuff, you know, together with LSD or whatever, you know, basically.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:46.160]   You've noticed, by the way, these are images of dumbbells.
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:51.000]   It seems like no dumbbell is complete if you look closely without a muscular arm.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.760]   So there's dumbbells, but there's also arms in here.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:00.280]   And when the computer sees those two linked, it says dumbbell.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:01.280]   Mm-hmm.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.600]   Might be hard to see a dumbbell without an arm holding it, though.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:05.600]   Right.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.000]   And it only knows what it sees.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.800]   And so if it never sees a dumbbell without an arm, it's like, well, if it's got to be
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:11.800]   something else.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:15.760]   It's just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more.
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:20.600]   And it's like, oh, this is a little bit more than a dumbbell.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:22.480]   And it's a little bit more than a dumbbell.
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:25.560]   So it's a little bit more than a dumbbell.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.720]   It's a little bit more than a dumbbell.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:30.280]   It's a little bit more than a dumbbell.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.200]   It's a little bit more than a dumbbell.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:35.400]   It's a little bit more than a dumbbell.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:37.320]   It's a little bit more than a dumbbell.
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.320]   It's a little bit more than a dumbbell.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.560]   So these are the representations internally of the neural network.
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.720]   Here's that dog snail.
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:46.720]   That's pretty crazy.
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:49.720]   Loving you were talking about.
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:50.720]   Wow.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:51.720]   Oh, man.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.280]   Who needs drugs, man?
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:54.920]   It's very, very vengo.
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:56.920]   Totally vengo.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:57.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.880]   There is, I think there is something to be said of, you know, if a brain is not doing
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:04.480]   a good job of organizing the information in the brain, it probably does look a lot like
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:05.880]   a neural network.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:08.400]   A very naive understanding.
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:16.920]   This is the admiral dog, the pig snail, the camel bird and the dogfish.
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:17.920]   Wow.
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:24.200]   So I guess it also shows a little bit, you know, deep neural networks, they're going
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:28.860]   to be popping up everywhere for, you know, I think maybe Facebook did something where
[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:32.880]   you can give it a caption and it will generate an image to match that.
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.360]   So you know, there's neural networks are going to show up in all kinds of places, you know,
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.440]   in the next five years, not in the next 50 years.
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:44.640]   Is this what they're using for face recognition, for instance?
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:49.680]   I mean, Google brain and the deep neural network stuff is used, I believe, but this might be
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:52.320]   a sub part, a different, you know, branch of that.
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:53.320]   Right.
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:58.400]   Let's talk about something that I know will get everybody kind of a little amplified here.
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:05.840]   Sundar Pachai spoke with Connor Doherty of the New York Times about intrusive technology
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.120]   and how it impacts our lives.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:10.040]   I thought it was an interesting conversation.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:12.480]   The interview itself is one thing.
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:15.160]   And Jeff, we'll talk about that here in a second.
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:20.040]   The point that Pachai was kind of making repeatedly through the interview, I thought
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:21.520]   were some interesting points.
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:27.120]   He's basically talking about how Google's aim with their products is to be user-centric,
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:33.760]   to make users happier, more productive people, not to get in the way and deteriorate the
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:35.000]   quality of life.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.880]   It's not the way that the burden is on the user right now.
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:42.040]   Sundar believes that, you know, that's not the way it should be.
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:47.760]   The burden should actually be on Google to create an experience to create and developers
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:53.800]   to create apps that, yeah, relieve the burden of the user and actually place the information
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:51:00.040]   in a user's hands without the user having to kind of seek it out.
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:02.080]   So I thought it was kind of an interesting talk.
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:04.000]   Did you get a chance to take a look at that, Aaron?
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000]   No, I was just looking at it.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.200]   I'm just trying to figure out, I mean, what do you guys think?
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:10.240]   I think it should be in the hands of the user.
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:18.640]   I mean, I guess so, but it seems like Google's in a pretty good position to do that though,
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:19.640]   right?
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:23.640]   Excuse me while I kill an aunt right back.
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:25.640]   I don't know.
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:33.000]   You know, I think Pachai really kind of touched on what I think is probably one of
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000]   the biggest challenges for Google and product design, which is like Google wants to create
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:42.200]   products that anticipate your needs maybe before you even know that you need them, right?
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:44.720]   To give you the answer before you ask.
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:48.520]   But they want to do that without being prescriptive, right?
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:53.040]   So this interviewer, which Jeff will speak to in a minute, you know, said, you know,
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.280]   are we all on our phones during dinner?
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:57.320]   Like is this a, you know, during dinner time with our family?
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:58.320]   Is this a good thing?
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:03.080]   And Pachai was like, that's, you know, that's not a technology decision, right?
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:04.560]   Like that's a human decision.
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:07.720]   That's a parent's decision when kids are involved.
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:11.600]   You know, but how do you, you know, we all know sort of the power of the faults and the
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:16.840]   power of the way like a great app works can really affect your behavior.
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:20.360]   So it was interesting to hear him talk about being user centric.
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:26.000]   And then this interview was just really, really pushing him in this direction of, but is this,
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.960]   you know, is this really making our lives better?
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:33.880]   I think it's clear to particularly viewers of this show that it's net, it's a net positive.
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:36.080]   I'm pretty optimistic about technology.
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:40.320]   And I think probably most, most people in our audience are maybe that's up for debate.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:44.680]   I know I, that's not for debate for me, but it did feel like this interview was just digging,
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:48.960]   just digging for, you know, how we're all buried in our screens and not connecting, you know,
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:51.160]   with each other and not present anymore.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:56.600]   He was writing another story that appeared as a commentary in Sunday Review and The Times
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:02.400]   about applications and hardware that try to wean you off your phone dependency.
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:04.200]   So he was looking for a quote from Sundar.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:05.040]   I've been a reporter.
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:05.640]   I teach it.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.400]   I get what's going on here.
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:10.640]   It's the, it's the journalist because the disease was saying, hoo, I wrote the whole story.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:14.600]   Now there's this little empty spot there, just perfect for a Sundar patch.
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:17.640]   I quote, and I'm going to go and get that quote.
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:22.240]   And so then you ask Sundar the question, basically, our phones kind of ruining our lives in our
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:26.400]   dinner and Sundar doesn't cooperate with him and says, well, no, I don't, I don't think
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:27.400]   so.
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:28.960]   I think that we're trying to get people what they want.
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:30.240]   So what do you do as a reporter?
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:33.840]   You ask the question again and again and again.
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.480]   I count basically six times.
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:38.040]   You essentially ask the same question.
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:40.600]   And the, and Sundar is of a rank.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:43.040]   He can't say, you know, kid, have few.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:44.040]   I'm not going to answer.
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:47.760]   I mean, what I do, what I do at some point, when this happens to me and I don't get interviewed
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:49.080]   off, what happens and I see it happening.
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:52.200]   And I say, listen, you can ask the question as often as you like, I'm not going to get
[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:53.320]   to give you the answer you want.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:54.320]   So stop.
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:58.120]   But Sundar can't say that because otherwise he's going to sound like he's being pissy.
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:01.080]   So the poor guy has to sit there and just wait and wait through it again and then find
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:06.920]   another way to say, no, I don't agree with you without saying no, I don't agree with
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:07.920]   you.
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:12.320]   And so he said, as Gina pointed out, he said, listen, is it the phone's decision?
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:13.320]   Is it Google's decision?
[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:15.440]   What kids or parents should do during dinner?
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.840]   That's for families to do.
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:19.000]   Who wants Google in the middle of that?
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000]   No.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.120]   And he says, you're not asking a technology question.
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:23.680]   We're here to tech technology.
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:28.960]   The other problem I have is, and I know he's on the beat, but you have the chance to sit
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.960]   down with the second most powerful man at the most powerful company on earth.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:37.400]   And this is what you do is just say, or the things you're making really cause you life
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:38.400]   to be awful.
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:41.560]   That's what drives me nuts.
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:45.080]   It's more of the it's the it's the techno panic is the beat.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:50.200]   And I just see more and more and more of this going on these days where publications that
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:56.880]   I respect are just buying right in to the contrarian view of technology that, well, wait,
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:59.600]   wait a second, though, isn't this bad?
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:00.600]   Isn't this bad?
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:05.600]   And okay, I get the point and maybe a discussion would be fine, but geez.
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:09.240]   I really liked how he kind of used himself as an example.
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:14.120]   You know, it was the reporters asking like, do you find in meetings that people are on
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.560]   their laptops or on their phones?
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:20.320]   And he said, well, one thing that I've learned about myself is that I don't multitask well,
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:21.880]   some people do, but I don't.
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:23.720]   So I don't check email all day long.
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:28.120]   I do email, you know, separately and distinct from the rest of my work.
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:29.920]   And that's how I work, right?
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:33.600]   And I felt like, you know, if he was being pissy, as you said, Jeff, he would have been
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:38.240]   like, this is a matter of self awareness of figuring out who you are and what your priorities
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:39.240]   are.
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:43.040]   And you check your email, you look at your phone, not as an impulse, but you know, as
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:46.440]   a mindful decision, because it's the right thing to do at the moment, right?
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:50.680]   You know, if you're just kids about to get born, you check your phone.
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:51.680]   If not, then you don't.
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:52.680]   Right.
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:55.760]   A couple of great moments where where Sundar said, well, you know what, we had a dinner
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:56.760]   before IO.
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:58.560]   We usually try to put some phones in the basket.
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:02.920]   But the one people, the one group that can't give up their phones is the PR people because
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:05.200]   you damn reporters keep calling them.
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:06.200]   Right?
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:08.320]   He said it nicer than that.
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:09.520]   But that was what it was.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.440]   My other favorite moment was the reporter says, and I found this just absurd.
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:18.120]   Well, one way that I try to, you know, tame my own evil instincts with phones is I allow
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:21.000]   it to be in only one room in the house.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.240]   You know, I, so I imagine that he got grandma's telephone, remember the old telephone table
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.880]   that sat in grandma's front room?
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:28.880]   Yep.
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:30.880]   And right.
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:31.880]   And that's where the, that's where the phone was.
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:35.080]   The little chair next to the phone and the wire into the wall next to the phone.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:38.640]   Hey, we invented new technology that lets you carry it anywhere.
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:39.640]   Wow.
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:43.160]   I'm going to put it back in one room with a string tied there.
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:49.600]   Ah, you know, but having said that, I suppose it still falls on the user in that case, right?
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:53.680]   If that works for you to curb your usage patterns, then I guess more power to you.
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.920]   And what Sundar is definitely saying here is it's not really up to Google to make those
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:58.920]   decisions.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:02.840]   And it seemed like the interviewer was trying to get that was trying to get the like, Google
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:06.200]   has a master plan for how you should use your device.
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:07.200]   Right.
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:12.200]   And our repeatedly said, as you were saying, is that that's, that's, that doesn't lie in
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:13.560]   Google's responsibility.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.960]   That's, that's up to an individual to make that type of decision.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.760]   I'm on my Android Wear watch today.
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:21.680]   I have in honor of back to the future day.
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:23.800]   I have a flux capacitor.
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:25.880]   It even has a little time.
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:26.880]   Oh, ribbon.
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.880]   It says shield eyes from light.
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:33.480]   And I think you can, I think you can, I think you could set it to travel through time.
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:34.480]   So that's.
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:37.040]   So yeah, it is back to the future day.
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:41.320]   And we're so pleased to welcome Matt cuts to the table.
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:42.960]   Hey, yes.
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:46.040]   Do are you still home, man?
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:47.600]   You still at home?
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:51.440]   I am calling from Omaha this week.
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:54.240]   What Nebraska is this for family?
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:55.240]   And all's are.
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:56.240]   That's where the involves are.
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:57.240]   Good.
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:57:58.240]   Yep.
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:00.040]   I think they have better connectivity than you do, Matt.
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:01.040]   I'm happy.
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.040]   All right.
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:03.040]   Very clear.
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:09.760]   If I'm like, can we get Google fiber in the Midwest just out of curiosity?
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:18.000]   Well, we were talking before the show about the new Nexus phones.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.560]   And I guess 5x and 6p went out for review to select reviewers across the country.
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:26.880]   Our own Jason Howell got a review unit.
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:31.280]   He's working on the 6p review for before you buy this week.
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:39.640]   And I just thought I brought in my old Nexus 6 just to kind of compare and contrast.
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:43.920]   So the Nexus 6 is bigger, obviously, 6 inch screen.
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:46.120]   This is a 5.7 inch screen.
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:50.000]   But I think in many respects, I mean, this is plastic bag.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:56.640]   Shamu, we loved you, but I think the time has come to take a look at the next generation
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:58.720]   of Nexus and boy.
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:02.200]   I can't wait to hear your review, Jason, but I'm just impressed as heck.
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:04.240]   Any previews, Jason, what are you thinking so far?
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:06.440]   I'm really, really liking the device.
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:07.440]   No surprise.
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:13.200]   I mean, the design of the device with kind of the aluminum body and everything just feels
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:14.200]   really nice.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:15.200]   It's heavy, but that's OK.
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:16.440]   It gives us sense of quality.
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:17.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:21.280]   I don't mind a little bit of weight because it makes me feel, at least in my brain, it
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:25.760]   makes me feel like it's got a solid build and it's not hollow and empty.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:30.040]   It's the camera bump at the top that everybody freaked out about, not nearly as pronounced
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:34.080]   as you might fear, although it might still bug some people.
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:35.080]   It's there.
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:36.080]   It's there.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:37.080]   It's not like it's wrong.
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:40.480]   And it's ironic because this whole right side is unnecessary.
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:43.920]   The camera and the flash and the sensor on the left, really, there's stuff over here.
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:45.400]   They packed that full of stuff.
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:46.400]   Oh, there is stuff.
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:48.760]   Yeah, there might be antennas in there, I think.
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:52.240]   That's where all the antennas reside as well as the camera.
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:53.840]   Because there's a plastic bottom here.
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:54.840]   There's other places where there's a lot of stuff.
[01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:58.240]   So there's other places where the antenna can leak out.
[01:59:58.240 --> 01:59:59.240]   But OK.
[01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:01.560]   Yeah, they put it all up there in that little window.
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:02.560]   Stereo speakers.
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:03.560]   Stereo speakers.
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:04.560]   Like that.
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.120]   The speakers sound great, especially compared to the Nexus 6.
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.720]   My car stereo is broken right now.
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:11.080]   So if I want to listen to anything, it's through the speakers on full blast.
[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:14.800]   So I've actually really noticed a difference between the two.
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:18.680]   It's not something I normally spend a lot of time with and I have on this timer.
[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:20.400]   What's the place of music through here?
[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:23.000]   I do love front facing speakers.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000]   I think those are...
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.600]   Oh, it's got an ad.
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:26.600]   That's all right.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:28.240]   I'm going to turn it all the way up.
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:29.240]   That's one thing that's changed.
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:30.240]   Don't, don't, don't, don't.
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:32.400]   Skip ad, you don't mind.
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:33.400]   Little Wayne.
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:34.400]   I'm a little Wayne.
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:37.720]   Did you just start, I'm feeling lucky or something?
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:38.720]   Yeah.
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:41.480]   Well, it sounds good.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:43.280]   I mean, it's not super bassy.
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:47.560]   Yeah, you're not going to get bass out of any of these speakers necessarily.
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:49.520]   I'm like, "Toss those."
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:51.520]   Oh, OK.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:55.560]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:59.000]   I'm feeling unlucky now.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.480]   I was worried about that.
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:05.360]   Fingerprint sensor is really, really nice.
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:06.360]   It's on the back.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:07.360]   I mean, it's so fast.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:08.360]   It's so cool.
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:09.360]   It's so cool to be fast.
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:12.200]   I think the problem with having it on the back is then that's enough.
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:13.200]   Thank you.
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:15.400]   Oh, Trap Queen, I like that.
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:18.480]   Is that you can't use it on the front, but big deal.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:19.880]   I mean, I don't think that's a big deal.
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:24.400]   I mean, you can also do the thing, which I always do, where if it's at a trusted location
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:27.400]   or tied to a trusted Bluetooth device, it doesn't lock at all.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:31.160]   So presumably, if it's in your office sitting on a desk or whatever, you're not going to
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:32.160]   be locked in.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:36.840]   With all of those extra security features that you can activate in Lollipop and Marshmallow,
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:41.880]   yeah, what I've realized is I don't enter my pin anymore because the fingerprint is
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:42.880]   sufficient.
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:43.880]   Right.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.280]   And I don't always have to use my fingerprint because I've got all the other things active.
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.280]   Right?
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.800]   So it depends on how comfortable you feel.
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:58.680]   I have it on the vent and the car because the ways is my means of getting around.
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:01.760]   And I just fear having to take it off about my finger on.
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:02.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:03.760]   That's true.
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:04.760]   Although it's new.
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:05.760]   The time to your car's Bluetooth.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:06.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:07.760]   Exactly.
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:08.760]   That's a trusted Bluetooth.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:09.760]   Oh, cars.
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:10.760]   What?
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:11.760]   Oh, never mind.
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:12.760]   That's right.
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:13.760]   You don't have to watch.
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:16.400]   If it works with steam powered engines, it might be OK, but yeah.
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:18.720]   Well, there you go.
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:19.720]   Get to your watch.
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:21.600]   And then if it's near you.
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:25.360]   I've been waiting to get a car with Android Auto.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:26.360]   Right.
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:27.360]   Right.
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:28.360]   Yeah.
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:31.600]   I can't get any straight answers out of Audi about when the heck is coming.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:33.240]   No car at once.
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:34.520]   So you'll probably put a case on it.
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:37.720]   So slipperiness is not really a big issue, I don't think.
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:38.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:41.440]   I spent a day without the case and the whole time I was afraid.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.680]   Yeah, it feels really.
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:44.160]   It feels very slick on the back here.
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:45.160]   Yeah.
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:46.160]   So I put that case on this more.
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:47.760]   I think it was this morning.
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:51.320]   I actually really liked the case a lot, but it makes me feel at least a little bit more
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:55.400]   comfortable that I'm not going to do what I did to my Nexus 6 with this.
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:58.320]   Is it one of the ones they sell all the time?
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:02:59.960]   Yeah, it is.
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:04.120]   It's actually part of the review unit package is what's on it.
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:05.120]   Yeah, this is clear.
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:06.120]   It says Nexus.
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:07.120]   This is clearly at Google.
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:08.120]   It's really nice.
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:09.120]   It feels really nice.
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:11.920]   How about storage enough, you think?
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:14.040]   This is a 64 gig phone.
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:15.040]   Yeah.
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:16.400]   Well, this one's the 16.
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:18.240]   The review unit, I believe, is the 16.
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:19.880]   So what is it, 16?
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:21.360]   No, I don't think so.
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:24.160]   It says 1232 gigabytes used a 5.6.
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:25.160]   Oh, you.
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:26.160]   Oh, so it's the 64.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:27.160]   Sorry.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:28.160]   It's a 64.
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:29.160]   Okay.
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:31.080]   So it's 32, 64, and 128.
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:35.560]   You don't have a micro SD, so it depends on how much you're storing on the device.
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.960]   I think 64 is perfectly sufficient for me.
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:38.960]   Absolutely.
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.000]   But you have a 128 option if you really need to go big.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.520]   Main thing I care about battery life.
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:45.520]   Battery?
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:47.240]   Here's where I have a disclaimer.
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:49.440]   I was going to be reviewing this week.
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:53.680]   I'm not now because this device is faulty, actually.
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:57.800]   There was something going on yesterday where my battery was going really wacko.
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:02.320]   When I reboot it, it gives me, before the Google logo, it gives me this big red asterisk
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:04.160]   and it says, "Your device is corrupt."
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:05.160]   Oh, that's the boot protection.
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:06.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:07.600]   There's something weird going on with it.
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:09.600]   I contacted Google PR.
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:11.400]   They're sending me a replacement device.
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:12.960]   So my review is going to be next week.
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:15.200]   I don't want to place any judgments on this device.
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:16.200]   It's like battery.
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:19.200]   I'm just going to say, look at this.
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:20.200]   Look at this.
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:24.800]   7 AM, you took it off just before 7 AM.
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:26.360]   You still have 60% left.
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:28.000]   They think you're going to get past midnight.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000]   I think that's pretty reasonable.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.400]   That's all I would ask if I could just get through the day.
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:36.160]   Yesterday, I took it off at 7 and by 3, it was like 13%.
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.160]   But that, again, yours was wack wonky.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:39.160]   Yes, exactly.
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:40.160]   That's what I mean.
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:44.240]   I was like, "Okay, that doesn't sound right compared to what I've heard from people,
[02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:45.760]   so I'm going to get a new unit."
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:47.280]   You've been using this one or not.
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:48.720]   Yeah, I've been using that.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:50.720]   So that's decent slope.
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:52.480]   I would say so.
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:55.360]   And it has the fast charge capability, so you can charge it up super quickly.
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:57.840]   Yeah, I like Type-C.
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:58.840]   So Matt cuts his get.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:02.040]   He gets the 6P, not the 5X, right?
[02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:09.880]   I ordered the 5X, and now I'm like, "Maybe I'll order the 6P and decide whether or maybe
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:15.200]   I'll just have a house phone, and then one for going out."
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:17.360]   That's one way to solve the battery problem.
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:18.360]   Yeah.
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:20.840]   I have my evening phone.
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:26.600]   I think the battery life I've been hearing from reviews on the 5X is not so hot.
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:27.600]   It's okay.
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:28.960]   Yeah, so I think that you want...
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:29.960]   And you know what, this doesn't...
[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:33.640]   Boy, especially compared to Shamo, this doesn't feel that big.
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:38.240]   No, you know what, it's a little narrower, but it's a little taller.
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:40.520]   And I think between the two, I think that's the better way to go.
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:45.280]   The Nexus 6 just felt too unwieldy when you were doing one-handed operation.
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:50.280]   And the 6P, I mean, that small change in narrowness actually makes a huge difference.
[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:51.560]   I can't wait.
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:55.200]   This is, I think this is going to be my go-to phone.
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:56.200]   For a month.
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:57.200]   And the camera?
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:58.200]   For a month.
[02:05:58.200 --> 02:05:59.200]   Hey, that's all you have to say.
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:00.200]   Hey, we know you well.
[02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:01.200]   That's my life.
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:02.200]   Yeah.
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:03.200]   A long time in League of Wolves.
[02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:04.200]   Yeah, it's true.
[02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:05.200]   It's true.
[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:06.200]   It's a long month.
[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:07.200]   Oh my God, that's incredible.
[02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:12.280]   The iPhone 6S Plus, which I really like, and battery life on that is amazing.
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:15.440]   But if I can get through the day, that's all I need.
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:16.440]   That's all I care about.
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:17.440]   I agree.
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:18.440]   It feels really premium.
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:19.440]   Yeah, it really does.
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:20.440]   It's nice.
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:21.440]   The screen is fantastic.
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:26.400]   It's a Samsung panel.
[02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:28.400]   The latest, basically Samsung panel.
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:31.080]   So right on par with what you get in the Note 5.
[02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:32.720]   Yeah, everything pops.
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:33.720]   It's nice.
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:34.720]   Nice.
[02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:36.720]   It feels fairly swift.
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:38.080]   Is this the replacement or is this?
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:40.480]   No, this is still the faulty.
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:42.120]   It still might be messed up.
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:43.920]   So keep that in mind.
[02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:44.920]   Yeah.
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:45.920]   Oops, can't capture this.
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:47.360]   I got to do the lens blur thing.
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:48.760]   All right.
[02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:49.840]   Slowly raise your device.
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:50.840]   Keep the subject.
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:51.840]   All right.
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:58.080]   Now I can change the focus to here or to there.
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:06:59.440]   I don't know, I guess not.
[02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.800]   I think you've got a little.
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:02.240]   It's still processing.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:03.240]   Yeah.
[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:04.240]   Nice.
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:10.960]   Now we don't have the 5X in studio, but Gina, do you have--
[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:11.960]   What?
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:12.960]   Oh.
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:13.960]   Yeah.
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:15.920]   So you went with the little one.
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:16.920]   I did.
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:18.080]   I went with the little one.
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:20.280]   I've had this thing for three hours.
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:21.280]   OK.
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:22.280]   All right, give us a full review.
[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:23.280]   Top to bottom.
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:25.880]   We want no details.
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:27.280]   I love it so far.
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:29.320]   Well, this is my first experience with the fingerprint
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:30.320]   sensor.
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:32.240]   So, you know, unlocking the phone, that's one thing.
[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:33.520]   That's going to be nice.
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:35.200]   But for me, it's a last pass.
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:36.200]   Yeah.
[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:40.640]   I am always typing in my super long last pass password, just
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:43.240]   being able to tap my fingerprint so much better.
[02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:46.320]   I also had the first time experience, the thing where you
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:48.800]   like take your old phone and you tap it to your new phone.
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:50.040]   And it's just like, bloop.
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:52.640]   And it just sets up your new phone with everything.
[02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:53.640]   That was amazing.
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:54.560]   Have you guys done that?
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:55.560]   Yeah.
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:56.560]   Yeah.
[02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:57.560]   I'm still around.
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:01.280]   It's actually one of the winning features of Android, I think.
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:03.000]   And so that you don't get with the OnePlus 2
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000]   because they left out NFC, right?
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.000]   Right.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.280]   Yeah, that was really, really, really nice.
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:10.960]   I have had weightier phones.
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:13.080]   This feels kind of light and plasticky to me.
[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:14.240]   And I'm kind of like chasing people.
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:15.240]   It's really light.
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:16.240]   It's like the car door thing, right?
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:18.320]   They try to like add weight to car doors because people
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:20.280]   perceive that the car is a higher quality.
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:22.440]   If the door's a little heavy and it has that like trunk
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:23.320]   when you close it.
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:24.440]   Same deal with phones for me.
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:27.440]   So it feels a little bit flimsy because I'm just used to a
[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:28.040]   giant phone.
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:31.200]   But I'm really happy to have a one handed device.
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:32.200]   And I don't know.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:34.640]   I'm interested to see how battery life is.
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:37.280]   Like I said, I just charged it and arrived today.
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:38.560]   And I just charged it a couple hours ago.
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:40.360]   So I'm still kind of on my way around.
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:42.240]   So I'm playing with the blur thing.
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:43.440]   So I'm making that in focus.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:45.160]   Now I'm going to make this in focus.
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:46.840]   It's pretty fast.
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:47.840]   Nice.
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:48.840]   Yeah.
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:50.200]   I feel like this is--
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:52.840]   Because that's built into--
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:53.760]   That's in the camera.
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:54.240]   Yeah.
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:58.040]   It's one of the camera settings.
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:00.040]   So the camera is very simple.
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:00.720]   But I like that.
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:01.480]   I don't mind that.
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.920]   You get a timer.
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:07.000]   You get an HDR.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.480]   It's an auto by default.
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:09.960]   You get flash.
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:11.120]   You get a menu here that gives you
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:13.480]   photosphere panorama lens blur.
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:14.560]   You get a larger setting.
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:20.120]   But it's a very simple camera with video choices.
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:24.760]   UHD 4K HD 1080p, HD 720p.
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:26.400]   And you can also do slow-mo, right?
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:27.160]   Yep.
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:28.440]   I haven't tested that yet, actually.
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:29.440]   I forgot about that.
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:31.200]   I forgot about the stabilization built in.
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:33.680]   This is nice.
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:34.160]   Nice.
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:36.080]   I like the way you get to video on this, by the way.
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:37.960]   You just swipe it right, right?
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:38.560]   Yep.
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:42.680]   Left to right or the other way to switch modes.
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:43.240]   That's a good one.
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:46.440]   I heard one complaint was that with a double tap of the power
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:47.800]   button to turn on the camera--
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:49.640]   Yeah, that's kind of weird, isn't it?
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:53.120]   Because it locks it and then it opens it up in camera.
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:54.200]   But now you've locked the phone.
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:55.760]   Is that true?
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:57.400]   Well, let's see.
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:09:59.240]   Actually, I can't tell because this phone doesn't have a lock.
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:04.080]   I mean, you're in camera.
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:05.080]   What more do you want?
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:07.680]   And with a fingerprint reader, it unlocks pretty darn quick.
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:09.480]   Yeah.
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:09.760]   I wouldn't--
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:10.240]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:11.320]   It is locked again.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:12.040]   Yeah.
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:14.600]   Lack of OIS is an issue.
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:17.440]   Yeah, I would agree.
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:21.040]   And Google had explained-- they had a Reddit AMA few weeks
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:24.680]   back, and they had explained that basically the larger--
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:26.040]   the larger pixels size.
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:27.240]   Pixel size.
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:28.400]   Helps to improve that.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:31.960]   But that's what HTC said with the M with a 1, right?
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:35.320]   Yeah, I just feel like no matter what you get more stable
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:38.840]   images with OIS, so that is a loss.
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:41.880]   I did order a new SIM because if you're a Google Fi user,
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:44.720]   you have to get the new SIM to use with the new phones.
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:45.320]   Really?
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:47.080]   Yeah.
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:49.640]   They warned me about that.
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:51.680]   I think if you stay with the Nexus 6, you're fine.
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:53.640]   But if you want to go with the 6P or the 5X,
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:56.200]   then they'd like you to have a new SIM.
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:10:57.520]   Are these your pictures adjacent?
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:03.560]   So this is a slow mo of a hummingbird shot with the 6P.
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:04.240]   Is this yours?
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:06.120]   No, this is not mine.
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:08.640]   This was a demo footage released before the devices
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:10.080]   hit anyone's hands.
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:11.360]   Isn't that cool?
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:13.960]   That is really cool.
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:16.440]   Holy moly.
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:19.280]   So Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, let's kick it off.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.080]   We're going to have to talk about Alphabet at some point.
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:22.920]   Let's start the show with Alphabet.
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:23.920]   Yeah.
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:27.360]   I have a perfect-- ABC, XYZ.
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:32.840]   That's the page because Google forgot to get alphabet.com.
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:35.000]   No, it's BBC.WTF.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:39.880]   Well, I guess that's one question.
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:42.640]   Will anybody ever go to alphabet.com because it isn't really
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:43.280]   a destination.
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:44.280]   Who cares?
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:44.800]   Yeah.
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:46.160]   My question is-- my related question
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:47.800]   is, will there be alphabet schwag?
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:48.640]   Because I want it.
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:50.560]   Yeah.
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:53.200]   So we'll let you kick things off, Jeff,
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:55.800]   because you wrote a good piece at buzzmachine.com.
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:11:58.760]   I know you've been thinking hard about this.
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:01.840]   What the hell?
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:03.280]   You know, in a second day, we've seen
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:05.320]   lots of people trying to find some cynical motive, which
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:07.880]   I find ridiculous because--
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:10.520]   Larry Page is, I think, the least cynical CEO I can imagine.
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:12.960]   I think it is what they say it is.
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:15.400]   This allows Larry Page and Sergey Brin
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:18.080]   to rise up to the strategic stratosphere.
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:21.040]   It allows them to do crazy things without affecting directly
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:23.120]   the business of Google, apart from taking Google's revenue
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:24.600]   to pay for it.
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:26.520]   It provides more transparency to Wall Street
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:28.640]   about what's being spent on what-- we'll see how exactly
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:30.120]   that plays itself out.
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:32.400]   It allows them to put Sundar Pichai, who's
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:36.000]   done brilliant work in full charge of the business.
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.560]   And the many Sundar Pichai's.
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:40.000]   There are many people that can be more easily retained
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:40.560]   through this business.
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:42.280]   Look at NASC, look at other places.
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:47.680]   And the thing about it is, the anecdote I told is--
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:49.160]   and I don't know if I told this on the show before,
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:50.000]   but I think I did.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.280]   When I met Larry at I/O, by way of introduction,
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:55.400]   I said on the guy who wrote the book, What Would Google Do?
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:57.280]   And he said, oh, yes, I remember.
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:12:59.320]   And then he said, what would Google do?
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:00.280]   I want to know.
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:01.600]   Tell me what.
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:04.080]   And so it makes a punchline to this story.
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.360]   But I think that the point is, is that Larry Page doesn't
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:07.560]   know what Google will do.
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:11.080]   That's exactly the point, is that even he will be surprised.
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:13.320]   They're looking for big problems and big solutions
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:15.400]   and moonshots and all that kind of stuff.
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:18.400]   And there's been efforts also to make analogs here,
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:19.520]   to call this Berkshire Hathaway.
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:20.360]   But that's not--
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:21.560]   It's not close.
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:22.880]   It's brilliant as both of it is.
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:24.720]   He doesn't invent things.
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:27.680]   I'll call it close to the old AT&T Bell Labs,
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:30.440]   but it's not that either.
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:32.280]   That was pure science, pure research.
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:34.160]   Amazing things happened because there was that freedom
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:36.800]   to do that and the monopoly to support it.
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:39.040]   But I think that, in this case, this
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:42.800]   is about invention and entrepreneurship and its purest form
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:45.680]   and the ability to go and try big things.
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:47.280]   And that's why I'm delighted with this.
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:48.680]   The final point to make is the question
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:51.560]   about what this impact this will have on dear old Europe
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:57.080]   and its regulators from the old world.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:59.880]   And one argument says that this will make it better
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:02.760]   because part of the problem Google gets into
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:04.360]   is when it shares stuff across divisions.
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:05.720]   But the truth is that everything we've
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:09.800]   gotten in trouble for sharing it across is still in Google Inc.
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:12.000]   And I'm afraid that I guarantee you
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.240]   will see just what we saw the cover of Der Spiegel a few
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:17.280]   months ago about the world government of Silicon Valley.
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:20.280]   This will probably guarantee you it'll get cited as C.
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:21.760]   Larry Page wants to take over the world
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:23.520]   and do all these huge things.
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:24.240]   Yeah, he does.
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:25.440]   And damn good for it.
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:26.560]   And that's why we should be supporting.
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:28.080]   That's what capitalism is for.
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:29.240]   So I don't think Europe's problems
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:30.400]   will go away at all from this.
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:33.400]   I don't think there's some gigantic secret agenda to this.
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:36.880]   I think it's what it appears to be, which is freedom to innovate.
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:41.840]   You take the post that Larry put at ABC.xyz at face value.
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:44.360]   It's exactly as he said it is.
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:46.760]   Yeah, I don't see-- because why else do this?
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:48.080]   Right.
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:49.160]   There's a lot of efforts to say.
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:51.720]   It's funny how many posts if you look--
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:53.840]   I just started a new column minutes ago
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:55.880]   for "The Observer" in New York on media.
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:58.280]   And I wrote about how we all write the same story over
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:00.280]   and over and over again and how I hate that.
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:02.000]   How many blue moon stories do we have?
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.600]   Well, in this case, how many times
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:06.040]   did I see the headline?
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:08.080]   Why Google did this?
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:10.520]   As if everybody knows exactly why Google did this.
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:12.560]   Well, Google said why Google did this.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:14.080]   And you could believe it or not.
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:15.760]   But yeah, I think--
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:17.520]   listen, if Comcast did something like this,
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:19.400]   Verizon did something like this, if companies like that
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:22.880]   did something, would I be cynical or at least skeptical,
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:24.600]   better put, of their motives?
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:25.040]   Yeah.
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:26.880]   But I don't think we've had the cause
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:30.000]   to be skeptical and cynical about Larry Page.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.680]   I think that he's trying to do good things and make good products
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:36.080]   and make a lot of money along the way.
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:38.040]   And so far, that's what he's done.
[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:40.040]   And the crazy stuff that-- who else
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:42.120]   would have the audacity to say, let's
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:44.360]   save thousands of lives on the roads
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:48.440]   by inviting self-driving cars and the entrepreneurial vision
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:51.400]   and technological vision to make it into a business.
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:53.760]   That's the kind of audacity that made this country great.
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:57.240]   Emmett, not Donald Trump's hat.
[02:15:57.240 --> 02:15:59.560]   And that's what we want to encourage.
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:00.760]   You agree, Matthew?
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:05.400]   Well, I mean, sure.
[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:08.160]   I mean, I don't see any ulterior motive.
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:10.480]   I don't see the--
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:13.360]   you know, I don't see it being some vast, evil plan.
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:16.800]   But I'll submit, I do wonder whether they're
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:18.160]   out a bunch of different motives.
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:20.600]   I mean, obviously freeing Larry and Sergey
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:23.840]   up to do whatever they want as one of those motives
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:27.800]   to get them away from the sort of humdrum day-to-day Google,
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:31.600]   which turns out all the cash, but has become quite boring.
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:35.120]   But I wonder if some of it isn't a little bit of--
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.800]   not sleight of hand, but a little bit of a shell game
[02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:41.080]   to try and keep the regulator's eyes off what
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:44.280]   is happening with Google or to keep Google part of this--
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:45.720]   How does that happen, Matthew?
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:48.560]   You have to be pretty dumb to be fooled.
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:50.480]   Whoa, it's half a bit now.
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:52.440]   Never mind.
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:54.840]   Matthew, Matthew, I'm trying to figure it out.
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:58.840]   Play it through for me about how this puts fences
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:00.160]   around things in a way--
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:02.600]   I'm not asking this in a hostile way.
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:06.000]   I'm curious to try to figure out that obviously that's
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.280]   a factor in what Google does right now
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:07.960]   is to try to have that.
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:11.200]   So they don't want to really think it's going to make it worse.
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:13.240]   How do you think it could make it better
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:15.120]   for the regulation question?
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:17.680]   I don't think it necessarily puts fences around things.
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:21.960]   But when you think about the public entity,
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:25.200]   the traded one, the one that has to report its results,
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:27.880]   is going to be alphabet now, not Google.
[02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:29.720]   So to some extent-- and I'm not saying
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:32.600]   they're going to confuse things deliberately
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:34.760]   or in an illegal way, or I'm just saying
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:37.880]   it takes the focus off Google to some extent.
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:40.160]   And puts it on this other thing called alphabet,
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:42.480]   which is going to have multiple different things,
[02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:45.680]   doing multiple different businesses and markets
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:47.200]   and business models.
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:49.480]   And there's going to be things flowing back and forth,
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:53.360]   none of which alphabet will have to talk about it
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:54.720]   if it doesn't want to.
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:58.560]   It won't have to report anything that those underlying
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:02.320]   operating subsidiaries do if it doesn't want to,
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:03.560]   including Google.
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:06.520]   So Google was the reporting entity before.
[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:07.960]   You see what I mean?
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:09.320]   Whereas now, alphabet's going to be--
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:13.960]   OK, but when it comes to the activities of let's say privacy,
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:16.760]   my contention is that Google is a personal services company.
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:18.720]   And as a result, it needs to know me as a person
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:20.920]   and serve me across all of the divisions.
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:24.640]   So it serves me still across the browser and Android,
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:27.680]   and Gmail, and Docs, and so on and so forth, and Maps,
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:29.000]   and Waze, and so on and so forth.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.160]   So all that's where they've gotten in trouble lately.
[02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:32.720]   And the one says, the other way they've
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:34.000]   gotten in trouble, let's say the privacy.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.440]   The other way they've gotten in trouble in Europe
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:38.880]   and the current antitrust is they promote their own products.
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:41.280]   Right.
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:44.600]   Well, they're still going to promote Maps within Chrome
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:46.560]   and within Search.
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:49.640]   And it doesn't matter whether they promote self-driving cars
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:51.040]   and say that or not, fine.
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:52.760]   They'll buy ads for that, whatever.
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:54.360]   That'll make a corporate exchange.
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:56.200]   So I think that the areas where they've
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:58.600]   gotten in trouble in Europe, and let's be clear
[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:02.080]   that it's mainly in Europe, it's still the case
[02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:04.960]   within Google and it's not about financial reporting.
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:07.400]   It's about behavior is what they'd say in Europe.
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:08.600]   I think.
[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:10.680]   But I am also thinking they're probably
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:12.120]   thinking about the future.
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:14.000]   They're not just thinking about the things they've gotten
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.920]   into trouble for already.
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:18.800]   In fact, many of those things have become irrelevant
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:20.600]   or are becoming irrelevant.
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:22.000]   I think they're thinking about what
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.760]   they may do in the future, which includes acquiring
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:28.000]   other companies, Twitter, whatever.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.200]   And they will become presumably operating units of alphabet.
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:33.720]   And then they can do whatever they want
[02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:35.920]   within those operating units.
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:36.920]   Do you know what I mean?
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:39.520]   They can-- I'm not just talking about this sort
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:42.840]   of public facing promotional aspect
[02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:44.200]   that they've gotten into trouble for.
[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:46.840]   I'm talking about the actual structural aspect
[02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:49.240]   of the company itself and the things it owns
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:52.280]   and the things that those businesses do between each other.
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:54.280]   By the way, I was on Bloomberg about this yesterday.
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:55.880]   And the other guy who was on the show
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:58.800]   said that the price jump that came from this announcement
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:01.320]   itself was just enough to buy Twitter.
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:02.320]   It was.
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:04.120]   And a market loves it.
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:06.040]   It went up 5% in an hour.
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:07.040]   That's enough to buy Twitter.
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:09.520]   That's $20 billion.
[02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:13.160]   And which is odd in a way, because Wall Street typically
[02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:14.880]   hates holding companies.
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:18.080]   It hates giant things that you can't make sense of.
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:20.720]   But the argument is there'll be more transparency here.
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:23.600]   Because they'll have to report results for these other divisions.
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:24.120]   Well, no.
[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:25.040]   They won't.
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:26.120]   But they're saying it's the same.
[02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:26.960]   What are they expected to?
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:28.280]   They'll be expected to.
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:29.960]   Well, they've said they will.
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:31.520]   They don't have to.
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:33.840]   In fact, they could say, hey, Alphabet's doing great.
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:36.360]   Here's all our operating units.
[02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:37.280]   Google made this much.
[02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:38.400]   Thanks for stopping by.
[02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:39.000]   Yeah, they don't.
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:40.280]   They don't survive.
[02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:41.040]   Really?
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:41.600]   Is that the case?
[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:42.880]   I mean, isn't it?
[02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:45.960]   So the Google stock is being transferred to Alphabet stock.
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:47.720]   So if you're a stockholder, don't they
[02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:51.680]   have the same responsibility now to report Alphabet results
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:53.080]   that they had for Google results?
[02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:53.580]   Yeah.
[02:20:53.580 --> 02:20:54.840]   The point Matthew's pointing exactly right.
[02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:55.560]   They don't have to say it.
[02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:58.000]   Just as Google never had to say exactly what YouTube was making.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.400]   They could say Alphabet as a whole.
[02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:01.400]   Yes.
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.720]   That's all they have to report.
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:03.240]   OK.
[02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:04.600]   The arguments I've heard all around
[02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:06.640]   is there'll be more transparency rather than less,
[02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:08.600]   that there will indeed be a transparency.
[02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:09.440]   There could be.
[02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:11.840]   And it also-- I mean, one of the benefits I can see
[02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:16.000]   is this structure makes it a lot easier to say in the future
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:19.080]   spin off or spin out part of YouTube, for example.
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:21.400]   Spin off or spin out part of Nest.
[02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:22.000]   Take that off--
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.560]   Which is a danger, don't you think, Matthew?
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:26.560]   If Europe starts to think about saying, let's break up Google
[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:29.920]   because it's too big, which we hear all the time,
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:33.040]   then does this beg that question?
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:35.160]   Mike Elton, you haven't had a chance to weigh in.
[02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:37.360]   Let's let Mike tell us what he thinks.
[02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:39.280]   And then I'm going to tell you how you're all wrong.
[02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:39.920]   Go ahead.
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:42.800]   Well, first of all, this is a groundbreaking move
[02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:46.080]   because I think I believe that Alphabet right now has
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:49.120]   three employees and their valuation is--
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:51.760]   Larry, Sergey, and Morath is here.
[02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:52.280]   Yeah.
[02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:52.840]   And Dave Drumlin, Dave Drumlin, Dave
[02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:55.160]   and Dave and I think maybe it's five or six.
[02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:56.000]   Even if it's 10--
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.520]   And it's $400 billion.
[02:21:57.520 --> 02:22:00.000]   But they have all the valuation of all the companies.
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.960]   And so from a valuation per employee or an employee per employee.
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:03.480]   It's very high.
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:04.920]   It's very high.
[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:06.600]   And that's a completely irrelevant point,
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:07.880]   but interesting nonetheless.
[02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:09.600]   I think there are other reasons that make--
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:11.440]   I agree with both of you actually.
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:13.000]   I think that this makes a ton of sense.
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.800]   I don't think there's reason for cynicism.
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:17.600]   And there are reasons they didn't mention.
[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:20.080]   I think one of these, for example, is--
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:21.720]   for example, when they bought Nest,
[02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:23.920]   they told Tony Fidel, we would keep it independent
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:26.640]   like a completely separate company.
[02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:28.400]   And that's been a little bit of a challenge.
[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:29.680]   It's a challenge because--
[02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:30.240]   You have a CEO.
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:31.720]   There's a CEO.
[02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:34.000]   And also there are other divisions within Google
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.720]   who would like that status.
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:37.120]   But just because they weren't acquired
[02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:38.600]   under the same circumstances.
[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:40.480]   And so this sort of normalizes all this.
[02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:44.160]   But I think one of the least appreciated benefits of this
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:45.360]   is the timeline issue.
[02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:50.280]   If you compare two extreme examples, like Nest and Calico.
[02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:52.840]   Nest is selling products right now.
[02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:55.480]   They have 2.0, 3.0 products right now.
[02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:57.640]   They're actively shipping and developing new products.
[02:22:57.640 --> 02:22:58.880]   It's a going concern.
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:01.720]   Calico is like, in the year 3,000,
[02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:04.120]   we will alleviate death forever.
[02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:07.600]   And so the timelines of those two enterprises
[02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:10.040]   are so out of whack with each other
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:12.400]   that each of these organizations seems
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:15.720]   to be based on timeline to a very large extent.
[02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:19.240]   What is the timeline that these initiatives and projects
[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:22.880]   and products are going to come online and be developed?
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:26.240]   And so I think that's a very liberating fact.
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:29.680]   And we talked about Google's Gigantism.
[02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:30.480]   Jeff mentioned it.
[02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:34.640]   But this is a company that not only doesn't know how big things
[02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:36.800]   are going to be, they want things to be as big as they
[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:37.680]   can possibly be.
[02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:39.600]   And every container--
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:41.200]   I've been farm-sitting this week.
[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:43.080]   I've taken care of somebody's farm.
[02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:44.640]   Imagine a farm then.
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:46.640]   So it lets you have chickens, and you have cows,
[02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:48.280]   and you have goats and pigs, and everything.
[02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:49.560]   And they're all in the same cage.
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:50.760]   That's one thing.
[02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:53.280]   If you right-size all the cages, then you
[02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:55.280]   have a much healthier ecosystem.
[02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:57.240]   All the animals can be free to do it.
[02:23:57.240 --> 02:23:58.520]   You're saying, Senator Pichare was
[02:23:58.520 --> 02:24:00.840]   about to pick Ruth Porat's eyes out?
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:01.920]   Yes, I am.
[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:03.760]   And it was really getting bad.
[02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:06.400]   We're going to have to slaughter one of them.
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:09.520]   At your point-- but I think your point about the CEOs,
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:12.520]   but those operating units having CEOs
[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:14.120]   is a big one that a bunch of people
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:17.200]   have made that it makes it easier to retain people.
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:19.160]   It makes it easier to offer people things,
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:22.000]   because they're going to be a CEO of an actual operating
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.880]   subsidiary, not just a part of Google,
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:26.200]   the thing that makes all the money.
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:28.480]   I think that's a bigger problem than people appreciate.
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:29.840]   It's not just CEOs.
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:30.760]   It's CFOs.
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:31.800]   It's all CFOs.
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:32.880]   Right now, it's not.
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:35.200]   But eventually, I presume, though, all the--
[02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:37.040]   It's divisional habits on C levels.
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:37.880]   Yes.
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:40.480]   And they have been bleeding employees over the last year
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:40.880]   or so.
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.240]   Google has been losing a lot of people.
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:45.160]   Sure, wouldn't you rather be the CFO of Calico
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:47.240]   than a low-level employee at Google?
[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:51.000]   They're basically saying they're implying that if you want
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.320]   to do a startup, don't leave Google and start a startup.
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:57.000]   Start a new company under Alphabet
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.280]   and retain the talent and so on.
[02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:02.040]   I think it's brilliant all the way around.
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:04.480]   One thing I wondered about, which I wrote about,
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:06.520]   I'd like to get your guys' thoughts.
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:10.720]   Why didn't YouTube become a separate subsidiary like Nez?
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:11.480]   I mean, it's--
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:13.320]   Because they don't want to report YouTube's results.
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.000]   Because YouTube, from a business perspective,
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:17.680]   YouTube very much belongs with Google.
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:18.200]   Because--
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:18.840]   Well, absolutely.
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:22.200]   Because it's an algorithmically-based advertising business.
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:22.680]   Exactly.
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:26.600]   The signals are harvested from YouTube
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:28.800]   and signals from search and other places
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:32.400]   are used in YouTube to provide relevant results and stuff.
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:34.680]   It's all about the algorithms and the advertising.
[02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:35.560]   Yep, I absolutely agree.
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:36.560]   But I think you could make--
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:39.040]   I think you could make just as strong an argument that it
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:39.920]   should be its own thing.
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:42.880]   I mean, it wants to become much more than just the search
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:43.240]   engine.
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:46.040]   It wants to become much more, I think, than just advertising.
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:47.360]   Well, it's free to do that within.
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:48.520]   I mean, let's go.
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:53.200]   But isn't the regulatory issue that Google faces most strongly
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:57.440]   the issue of promoting its own properties in search?
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:00.080]   I mean, from my point of view, I'd love to see Google get--
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:02.040]   I've said this many times, get out of the content business.
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:04.680]   Why not spin off YouTube?
[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:05.200]   Well, I--
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:06.600]   Well, I don't have this argument regularly.
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:08.080]   It's not really in the content business,
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:09.760]   it's in the content serving business.
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:10.920]   It doesn't own the content.
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:12.560]   It wants to be in the content business, though.
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:13.060]   It doesn't.
[02:26:13.060 --> 02:26:13.560]   It doesn't.
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:14.560]   It doesn't own the content business.
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:15.560]   It knows what the content business is.
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:16.560]   It wants to be--
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:17.560]   It's probably a group.
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:18.560]   Any business can be generated with algorithms.
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:20.440]   But the reason people are considering--
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:22.720]   it's not crazy to think that YouTube would have been spun
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:24.600]   out as a separate company, because it was already a
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:25.400]   subsidiary.
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:27.200]   It already has a CEO.
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:28.200]   Right.
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:29.680]   So it is surprising in that sense.
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:32.960]   I think you guys are overthinking this.
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:34.840]   Here's what I think this is all about.
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:36.440]   You were professionals, Leo.
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:37.720]   You usually underthinkly.
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:39.040]   This was basically new.
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:40.760]   Here's what I think this is all about.
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:43.200]   And I do believe them when they say this has been something--
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:48.200]   the story is that Salman Kamengar came to the board years
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:50.240]   ago, like several years ago, and said, you know, you guys
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:51.880]   should think about this.
[02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:53.240]   And then they've been chewing on it.
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:54.880]   And something like this doesn't happen overnight.
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:55.960]   It's probably been in the make.
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:57.680]   It works for a year or so.
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:26:59.360]   But here's what I really think is happening.
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:03.280]   I think what really happened is that Larry wants to step down.
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:06.880]   Wants Sundar Pachai to be CEO.
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:08.400]   And because I think Larry's tired--
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:09.760]   and he even kind of implies this--
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:12.200]   tired of taking meetings about search and ads.
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:14.040]   He doesn't want to go to those meetings anymore.
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:18.160]   But he knows it would be a big hit if he said,
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:21.400]   I'm going to become executive chair.
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:24.080]   And because truthfully-- and this is my question--
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:27.560]   couldn't you do everything they've done without this compartment?
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:28.760]   You totally could.
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:29.960]   This is just what--
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:31.120]   But this is a reorg.
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:32.440]   Many, many companies have done this.
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:33.600]   Google themselves have done this.
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:35.560]   Larry is too big for the normal route.
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:37.040]   The normal route has you become a VC.
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:38.040]   He's too big to be a VC.
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:39.040]   I've done waving.
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:41.400]   I think this is all saying, pay no attention to the fact
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:44.440]   that I'm going to step down and Sundar's going to be the CEO.
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:47.160]   I think you're right in the tactical view, Leo.
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:48.600]   But in the strategic view, I think
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:50.760]   there are also trying to build a company for the ages.
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:51.680]   And if Larry gets to--
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:52.200]   Well, I agree.
[02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:54.800]   I'm not saying that there aren't subsidiary benefits.
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:55.800]   Yes.
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:57.360]   There are absolutely subsidiary benefits.
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:59.840]   There are also subsidiary negatives--
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:00.360]   Yes.
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:03.200]   --risk because they've said specifically,
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:07.560]   they're going to provide Q4 reports for every segment.
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:10.600]   And this makes Larry, as somebody said, a capital allocator.
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:11.520]   That's really his job.
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:13.080]   And that's what he says his job will be.
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:14.880]   So the top of your point--
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:16.280]   He is a VC.
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:19.720]   We will rigorously-- this is the salient paragraph.
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:21.800]   Alphabet is about businesses prospering
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:24.240]   through strong leaders and independence.
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:27.080]   In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who
[02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:30.440]   runs each business with Sergey and me in service to them
[02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:31.800]   as needed.
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:33.560]   That means not running it.
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:36.600]   I mean, service means, oh, you need some money?
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:37.880]   Let me get the checkbook out.
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:41.400]   He will rigorously handle capital allocation, rigorously
[02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:43.600]   handle capital allocation.
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:45.480]   That term rigorously is interesting.
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:46.080]   Sounds painful.
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:48.880]   And work to make sure each business is executing well.
[02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:51.760]   We'll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business.
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:53.960]   And we'll determine their compensation.
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:56.160]   In addition with this new structure-- and this is interesting
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:57.960]   that you pointed out, this doesn't have to be done.
[02:28:57.960 --> 02:28:59.480]   But they've said, with this new structure,
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:03.080]   we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results.
[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:04.960]   Google financials have provided separately
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:07.760]   than those for the rest of the Alphabet businesses as a whole.
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:09.480]   They don't have to do that.
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:13.040]   Sounds to me like this will facilitate spinouts
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:14.640]   by doing-- spinoffs by doing that.
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:15.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:19.040]   When you say risks, Leo, when you say risks, think about this.
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:22.720]   So now you have Larry and Sergey sitting there
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:25.520]   with a big pile of money that Google has produced.
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:26.320]   On the jet.
[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:28.280]   That's still the growth engine.
[02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:30.600]   And they've got all these CEOs.
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:33.080]   They're no longer BPs of such and such a unit.
[02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:35.520]   They're now CEOs of operating subsidiaries
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:40.200]   who have to come and say, I want X% of Google's money
[02:29:40.200 --> 02:29:41.360]   to do this.
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:44.640]   And then Larry and Sergey have to slice up the dough
[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:46.640]   and hand it out to those CEOs.
[02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:49.960]   It could actually create a lot more problems,
[02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:50.800]   I'll probably--
[02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:51.440]   Well, you're right, man.
[02:29:51.440 --> 02:29:53.280]   But here's the real risk.
[02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:58.080]   Is that-- I think we'll be past the idea that Larry is
[02:29:58.080 --> 02:29:58.800]   a one-hit wonder.
[02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:01.080]   But let's just say that his hits are behind him.
[02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:02.600]   Just for the sake of argument here.
[02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:03.600]   Then you're right.
[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:04.600]   Is he 43?
[02:30:04.600 --> 02:30:05.120]   No, no, no.
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:06.080]   I'm just saying he has no--
[02:30:06.080 --> 02:30:06.440]   Don't worry.
[02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:08.080]   If you were in the NBA, maybe.
[02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:08.600]   OK, go ahead.
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:11.480]   Let me-- I believe fully that Larry Page doesn't matter.
[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:12.920]   He's going to live forever.
[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:13.680]   Let me be clear.
[02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:14.800]   He's many more huge incentive.
[02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:16.280]   I'm just trying to say structurally.
[02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:17.760]   But then, then, Matt, his point is right.
[02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:21.000]   Then all you're doing is divvying up Google's money
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:22.200]   for the future.
[02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:25.320]   But the other pressure on Google, which has been tremendous,
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:26.640]   is to diversify.
[02:30:26.640 --> 02:30:27.760]   And that's a key part of this.
[02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:31.240]   It's 96% to 98% of their revenue is advertising.
[02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:34.000]   So by taking alphabet and by getting into new businesses,
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.240]   which may take a while to grow, but new businesses that
[02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:39.800]   are not ad supported purely, then that diversifies
[02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:40.920]   the corporation as a whole.
[02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:44.280]   And that's been another huge pressure on them.
[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:46.560]   But it only works if they create new businesses.
[02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:49.080]   And that's highly risky, like all entrepreneurial ventures
[02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:49.760]   are.
[02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:50.920]   And that's where they really are.
[02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:52.440]   So they're going to allocate capital.
[02:30:52.440 --> 02:30:55.240]   But unlike just a Warren Buffett, they're not going to just
[02:30:55.240 --> 02:30:56.120]   buy things.
[02:30:56.120 --> 02:30:58.160]   They're going to build new things and build entirely new
[02:30:58.160 --> 02:30:59.080]   industries.
[02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:03.120]   High risk, high return, high growth.
[02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:05.640]   So I think that's the audacious goal.
[02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:07.840]   Then the divvying up of Google's money
[02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:09.800]   shouldn't be an issue because there should be lots more money
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:11.520]   to be made by all these other divisions.
[02:31:11.520 --> 02:31:14.360]   In the meantime, instead of having operating
[02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:17.880]   VPs of this and that, they have a bunch of CEOs
[02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:21.280]   who all now think, I'm the CEO of this damn thing.
[02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:22.680]   I don't have to--
[02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:24.440]   I should be running X company.
[02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:25.600]   Oh, my guess is that--
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:26.240]   [INAUDIBLE]
[02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:27.680]   If they're going to get good CEOs, they're
[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:28.640]   going to let them do what they want.
[02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:32.040]   They're going to give them total autonomy.
[02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:34.560]   And if they make money, then they'll have--
[02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:35.040]   No, it is.
[02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:37.640]   It's serfdom.
[02:31:37.640 --> 02:31:38.840]   It's a feudal system.
[02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:39.960]   It's a feudal system.
[02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:41.760]   And he's the lord of the manor.
[02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:42.280]   Yes.
[02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:42.560]   Yeah.
[02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:44.840]   But listen, that's guys-- I've worked in many companies
[02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:47.920]   where newspaper chains, where you had 20 newspapers,
[02:31:47.920 --> 02:31:48.720]   each had a CEO.
[02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:49.120]   But you know what?
[02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:49.760]   They did every month.
[02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:51.400]   They gave a bag of money to HQ.
[02:31:51.400 --> 02:31:51.900]   Right.
[02:31:51.900 --> 02:31:53.120]   And HQ decided what to do with that.
[02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:53.120]   Right.
[02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:54.560]   That's quite normal.
[02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:54.920]   Well, good.
[02:31:54.920 --> 02:31:55.960]   That's what's going to happen.
[02:31:55.960 --> 02:31:58.480]   And will Larry have to go to meetings?
[02:31:58.480 --> 02:32:00.160]   Only if he wants to.
[02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:01.560]   Oh, only if it's on the jet.
[02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:02.560]   Oh, Leo, me and--
[02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:03.640]   --means come to Larry.
[02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:03.920]   Yeah.
[02:32:03.920 --> 02:32:05.000]   So my point--
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:09.760]   Do you not think that this is retirement for Larry Page?
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:10.320]   No.
[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:13.080]   Because I think it's retirement from the day to day of Google.
[02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:13.580]   Google.
[02:32:13.580 --> 02:32:14.600]   I think it's--
[02:32:14.600 --> 02:32:16.240]   I think it's Larry retrained--
[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:17.600]   was used to build new Google.
[02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:18.600]   Yeah, well, it's a promotion.
[02:32:18.600 --> 02:32:20.560]   Retirement means you get to do what you want.
[02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:21.960]   If you want to putter in the garden,
[02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:23.280]   you get to putter in the garden.
[02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:24.960]   Yeah, but he's going to have higher goals than that.
[02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:25.960]   He's going to build a car.
[02:32:25.960 --> 02:32:26.600]   Well, of course he is.
[02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:28.480]   But to me, it was--
[02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:29.920]   I mean, if I'm Larry Page, I'm sitting here.
[02:32:29.920 --> 02:32:32.200]   I'm going, god, I have to take another meeting on what
[02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:35.680]   color the home page banner should be.
[02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:36.200]   Or your--
[02:32:36.200 --> 02:32:37.800]   --or your regulators up our ass.
[02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:38.120]   Yeah.
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:41.360]   Sundar, could you take this call for me?
[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:44.320]   He doesn't want to run at day to day.
[02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:46.640]   But who's going to referee between all those CEOs?
[02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:48.840]   Who's going to decide where that Google money goes?
[02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:49.840]   Ruth Foreman.
[02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:50.480]   He's very--
[02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:51.840]   --there's only one division--
[02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:53.120]   --or the elephant.
[02:32:53.120 --> 02:32:53.600]   That's Google.
[02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:54.800]   Or where's Bush is the decider?
[02:32:54.800 --> 02:32:55.960]   Larry is the allocator.
[02:32:55.960 --> 02:32:59.240]   Isn't, though, what's Sergey's role in all of this?
[02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:00.560]   What's his role now?
[02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:02.080]   Object X, big ideas.
[02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:02.720]   See, Sergey--
[02:33:02.720 --> 02:33:05.000]   See, in my opinion, Sergey did this a few years ago.
[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.040]   Yeah.
[02:33:06.040 --> 02:33:09.720]   And Larry's looking at Sergey going, man, he's got this project.
[02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:11.600]   X, he's having fun, he's zooming around.
[02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:12.360]   Doesn't wear shoes.
[02:33:12.360 --> 02:33:13.640]   Rocket ships.
[02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:16.000]   And me, I'm sitting in the meeting about what
[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:17.680]   color the Google banner is.
[02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:18.200]   Can we please--
[02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:19.440]   --pay for this flood?
[02:33:19.440 --> 02:33:23.040]   So he's-- I bet you he's going to watch his philanthropy.
[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:24.280]   See what happens with his philanthropy.
[02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:26.400]   He's got a foundation.
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:32.760]   Watch what happens with Project X plus 1, the Larry Page version.
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:36.040]   And what would have happened if instead of this,
[02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:38.240]   Google went through some sort of reorg.
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:41.320]   And Larry said, now I'm going to go join the board
[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:43.240]   and send our prize, the CEO of Google.
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:43.600]   Stop it.
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:45.240]   How would the market have reacted to that?
[02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:45.760]   Now.
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:47.240]   Yeah.
[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:48.320]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:48.640]   I agree.
[02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:52.480]   Why don't I take Twit and spin off--
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:53.880]   --because it's operating you, too.
[02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:56.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:33:59.920]   Actually, it is not an unheard of thing.
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:03.120]   For instance, if we're considering--
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:05.160]   and we have been considering buying a building,
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:06.320]   you wouldn't buy it as Twit.
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:08.920]   You would buy it as a separate operating division.
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:11.120]   You'd create a new LLC.
[02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:11.400]   And then--
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:12.320]   Why do you do that?
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:12.840]   Another company.
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:15.200]   And then you rent another company, you rent back to Twit.
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:17.320]   Oh, I see, right.
[02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:18.160]   I don't understand.
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:19.240]   You could get the URL--
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:19.320]   And it's not.
[02:34:19.320 --> 02:34:20.680]   --ABCBFD.
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:21.960]   The FD.
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:22.800]   And it's--
[02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:23.480]   --be great.
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:24.120]   You could sit on it.
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:26.880]   The building would be owned by a numbered company listed
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:27.800]   in the Cayman I'm--
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:29.200]   --on this, typically.
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:32.640]   This is not unusual at all in business.
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:35.040]   In fact, Lisa's prior job, which was
[02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:37.040]   working for a massive development company,
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:39.160]   every development they did was a separate LLC.
[02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:42.760]   At one point, she was managing well over 100 LLCs.
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:46.680]   So that's very-- it's not a bad way to do things,
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:48.720]   because it does kind of separate the structure out.
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:49.440]   Come to think of it.
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:51.000]   That's how Trump runs his business.
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:52.920]   That's right.
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:54.320]   Did everybody else is a loser?
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:55.880]   They're all stupid.
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:57.560]   You're stupid.
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:34:59.920]   The reason why people kept thinking of Berkshire Hathaway
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:02.120]   is that Berkshire Hathaway started
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:04.560]   with the thing that makes the money.
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:06.200]   And so there's this core business
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:08.720]   that just spins off vast amounts of cash.
[02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:10.000]   But it's very different, right?
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.840]   It's just a holding company, right?
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:15.040]   Right, but Warren invests that cash in other things.
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:16.120]   He doesn't build things.
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:18.840]   He doesn't not try to cure cancer.
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:23.080]   He just buys a bit of Coca-Cola and a bit of Dairy Queen
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:24.600]   and a bit of whatever.
[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:26.120]   But it's a similar strategy.
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:29.280]   You have a money spewing thing at the core.
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:33.320]   And then he gets doubled out to different things.
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:36.440]   It's been great to watch everybody from Danny Sullivan
[02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:41.600]   to you, Matthew, to you, Jeff, kind of try to tease out
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:44.040]   the meaning in all this.
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:46.080]   My favorite was when it first happened,
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:48.320]   when the announcement first came out,
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:50.680]   it happened to be looking at Twitter.
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:53.440]   And of course, because my eyes were open.
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:54.440]   It happened?
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:55.360]   It happened?
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:35:58.360]   Or is it just something you do all the time?
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:02.240]   The first things I saw were literally WTF
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:04.080]   with a bunch of exclamation marks.
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:08.120]   Because the first response was, what the hell is going on?
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:09.520]   What does this even mean?
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:10.480]   I don't get it.
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:11.440]   That was my reaction.
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:13.160]   We were on the air when we got the word.
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:14.240]   We were doing iOS today.
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:16.920]   My first reaction was that it was a joke or something like that.
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:19.320]   Yeah, I got a reporter coming to me saying,
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:20.400]   I presume you've heard this.
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:21.560]   We want to talk to you about this.
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:23.720]   I thought, what?
[02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:24.680]   And I was driving.
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:28.200]   So I literally pull off the road to go look at that.
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:31.200]   So this is too big to just ignore and get to 10 minutes.
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:33.080]   Yeah, much we need self-driving cars, Jeff.
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:34.920]   You could have just kept going.
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:38.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:41.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:44.220]   (upbeat music)
[02:36:44.220 --> 02:36:45.780]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
