[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.520]   Firephone, the nail in its coffin, the kind of the class war of high-end versus
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.640]   mid-range devices going on right now. Google and China, and so much more.

[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.000]   It's time for this week in Google or some people call it Twig. My name is Jason
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.560]   Howell. I am filling in for Leo who is in New York. I believe he's at a meetup
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.480]   right now. He's in New York for a few other things but he's partying down with
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.000]   Paul Therat of Windows Weekly and a whole lot of other people. Probably some fans
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.280]   there as well. I would imagine that's kind of what it was all about anyways.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.280]   I'm happy to be back. I love filling in for him when he's gone and I've got my aid team here
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.320]   to back me up. Well one member of my aid team is gone. Jeff Jarvis, he's in Vienna right now.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.520]   I checked him with him like an hour ago and I was like, "So do you think you're gonna make it?"
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.560]   He's like, "I have to wake up in four hours so no I don't think so."
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.200]   So I guess I forgive him. But in his place we have not one but two amazing people to fill in.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   First of all, sitting to my right here, Aaron Nukem. How's it going man? Good, good, good to be here.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.680]   He said A-show. I thought you were gonna say the double A-show. See, what you'll realize very
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.000]   quickly what I introduce our next guest is that this is pretty much everybody from all about
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.680]   Android minus Ron Richards. Also joining us Gina Trapani just heard her laughing. How's it going Gina?
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.160]   Good, good. I heard that Leo was doing a meetup in Manhattan and you know I'm here in Brooklyn and
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.440]   I was like, "Oh great, I'm gonna drop it on the calendar." And I was like, "I'm doing Twig during
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.080]   that time." All right, I'll let her. I'll get to them another time. Everybody else bailed on today's
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.200]   shows so you know, you would, I would have understood anyways. But I'm thrilled to have you here.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.720]   It's awesome that I could get you both on the hook. And then, well normally I switch the show.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.560]   Usually the technical director but instead we have Brian Bernadt who is normally the technical
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.920]   director of all about Android. So it really is like all about Android during the day.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.200]   Pretty much. Yeah. I mean it's all the same people. Where's Ron? I'll try and get him on Skype.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.280]   Yeah, if you could please. I'm sure he's not doing anything. You know, he just started a new job
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.720]   by the way. So I'm sure he's not busy. You know, you can pull him away from his new duties and
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.640]   throw him on a podcast. So I'm not going to lie with you guys. I was looking through the content,
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.920]   throwing it all together in the doc. We were all kind of working as a team to try and fill
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.880]   up his doc. There is not a lot of news. And I'm sure you can guess why Apple had their big
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.160]   unveiling today. Probably their biggest event of the year. So why don't we get that out of the
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.520]   way. We don't have to talk a whole lot about Apple. I know a bunch of people just rolled their
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.640]   eyes when they heard me say that. But I feel like including you. Okay, I'll be completely honest.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.560]   I wasn't paying even though I was producing Macbreak Weekly. I was not paying attention to the actual
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.680]   devices. So I'm a little bit clueless. Gina, I know you were kind of watching in Safari. I saw
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.920]   that on Twitter. Was there anything that really stood out to you? Anything that made your ears perk
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.080]   up? It was funny. I was curious to know what you think, Jason, because you were like one of the
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.200]   few people in my life who has been sort of untouched by the reality distortion field. Like
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.440]   relatively. I'm so untouched that I'm clueless. Right. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I mean,
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.760]   there are a couple of things, but I'm curious to hear what you have to say first. Yeah, I mean,
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.760]   you know, I have to say that the event today did kind of inspire some gadget lust for me,
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.400]   particularly the thing that I was particularly taken with was the 3D touch on the in the new
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.720]   iPhones, particularly in the pricing that that you know, leasing an iPhone where you can kind of pay
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.840]   $32 a month, get an unlocked iPhone, you get Apple care, and you just get a new swap it out for a new
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.000]   model every year. I was like, Oh, that's something I might want. You're paying that directly to Apple.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.520]   That's not through the carrier. Yeah, you're like, we're using a phone right not like a carrier.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.040]   It's not a plan. So it's an unlock phone. You have to get your own plan, which I do. I have a T
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.440]   mobile, you know, a plan that's pays you go and I pop my sim in and out of different different
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.080]   phones, which works with unlock phones, which works really well on the Android side. And I'm,
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.000]   I think I should be able to do that with one of the new iPhones. So I found the kind of stylists
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.920]   and the soft keyboard amusing because it seemed like something that Apple would never do, but Apple
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.920]   kind of added their, their own touches to it. And I got to tell you, watching that, that,
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.040]   that pen, the Apple pen on that screen made me think like, wow, I, I really want to try that.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.120]   The pressure and sliding the pen to the side, it looked, it looked kind of neat. I mean,
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.600]   this video is like Apple to a T as far as like their product videos are concerned super close up,
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:20.520]   rack focus, the pen is gliding over the display so slowly, but accurately to portray an
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.120]   artistic image. I mean, I mean, but I mean, it looks pretty impressive. This is very different
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.720]   from what we've seen like Samsung has the note tablets and has the S Pen that's not,
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.120]   are there layers? Are there layers with the S Pen? I feel like if you pressed harder with the
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.920]   S Pen, you get a thicker, but I don't know if that's necessarily a 3D touch or whatever it's called.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.200]   Works like that. I mean, the shield came with the stylus. And so the first thing I did,
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.400]   I'm not an artist, I gave it to my daughter and, and she was playing with it and she drew some
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.960]   pretty cool stuff with it. So there's obviously a market there for this. And as the technology
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.200]   marches on, I think more and more people are comfortable working in that sort of a medium with the,
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.280]   with the tablet and a stylus. And so I think that there's definitely interest there. That
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.080]   was the thing that caught my attention, even though I really didn't know about it until I
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.440]   asked Tony right before we started the show, like what happened with the announcement? He's like,
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.880]   Oh, there's cool stylus. It's like awesome. Which by the way, I think is something is,
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.880]   it's one of those health freezes over moments. Yeah, stylus coming out, you know, that Apple
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:21.000]   is like super behind. Because I think the thing with Steve Jobs was always the best stylus that
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.320]   you have is your finger. Like that's the only stylus we're going to do. So, but you know, but
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.320]   I think this is, I mean, a lot of people used back in the day, since I'm an older person. I mean,
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.720]   a lot of people used Apple products for artistic endeavors, you know, more than they would use a
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.200]   PC. And so I think this in some ways, this is like going back to their roots a little bit,
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.480]   kind of going towards the artists, you know, in the past, it's been video production people or
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.720]   other things. But now, you know, reaching out to those people who want to draw. I don't know,
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:56.200]   I think it's kind of cool. And it's unique. And that's the thing that I point to, no pun intended,
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:03.480]   is, yeah, you know, that so much of what happens is just iterative anymore. And I don't know about
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.680]   the phones. I mean, you know, they added an S, I guess that's a good thing. That means something.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.040]   Yeah, I don't know, maybe there's a new OS or something. But I mean, it's all iterative, right?
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.360]   And at least with the stylists, it's, oh, that's, that's kind of, you know, new clever, and they're
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.880]   doing some different things with it. And so I don't know, I always look to those kinds of things as
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.240]   being the things that kind of set these things apart as opposed to just new phones, faster processors,
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.920]   bigger tablets, whatever. Yeah, I mean, you know, for me, it was very much a testament to Apple's
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.760]   marketing. I don't know if it's the way they presented or that the commercials or what it was.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   But you know, I've seen plenty of tablets and devices with styluses before. And I always thought,
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.160]   I looked at this one today and thought, like, Oh, I really want to start drawing. I mean,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.840]   everyone who watched the keynote today was like, Oh, I'm going to get one of those, and then I'm
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.240]   going to start drawing and I'm going to be really good at it, right? Which is just just a testament
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.160]   to Apple's marketing and the way that they're able to make something that exists cool and new,
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.400]   kind of in a whole, in a whole new way. Apple TV was also kind of interesting.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.480]   You know, there were some features of Apple TV that was just like, I mean, I don't want to know
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.200]   what the weather in Alaska is when I'm in the middle of watching, you know, Mad Men. But there are a
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.040]   couple of interesting features. The one the one Apple TV feature I really liked is if you're watching,
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.880]   you can say to your remote, what did she say? You know, if you missed something that someone says
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.960]   in the show and it automatically skips back 15 seconds, turns on closed captioning temporarily
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.440]   and plays back what you missed. And that's like, Oh, yeah, that's something I do when I watch TV that
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.200]   I, you know, that I haven't seen before. That's a very human natural interaction. So,
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.480]   yeah, thought there was some interesting stuff there today made me think about
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:43.960]   M and you know, what, or I guess marshmallow. Now we call it, you know, and kind of what I'm
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.160]   what I'm looking forward to there and what I would like to see. I definitely like, like I said,
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.880]   the 3D touch in iOS, how you kind of you kind of you do touch a little harder, you press a little
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:58.920]   more pressure and a part of the in iOS, you know, a fragment or a message or a photo pops up.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.880]   And I really like that that they have like pop and peak and you know, Android has something
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:09.160]   very similar. There's several apps where you know, you long press and it initiates an action like that.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:14.440]   But I really like the way how smooth looked in iOS and how nice it looked. It made me really
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.440]   want to try it. I don't feel that way that often after Apple events. I'm usually like, yeah, you
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:26.600]   know, whatever. But today I did. Yeah, it's interesting. The what is it 3D touch is what was once forced
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.760]   touch. So I'm wondering, you know, if that extends beyond. Huawei actually, and I just I just put
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:39.160]   the link and I didn't have this in the doc, but it's in the chat, chat area, while we at at
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:46.520]   was it last week. Why am I suddenly blanking in Berlin? Anyways, whatever, Huawei showed off
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:54.520]   their as send mate s. They have actually integrated force touch into their display as well. So when
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:00.280]   they showed it off, you know, it can do things like, you know, you could you could use it as a scale.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.400]   In other words, you can actually put the put the phone on a table, set an orange on top of it,
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.600]   and I'll tell you how much the orange way is. Oh, wow. So and this is Huawei. Huawei suddenly is
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.880]   this manufacturer that I feel like we're going to continue to hear more and more about the rumor
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.240]   that they're going to have the next. Yeah, there we go. Fruit on a phone. It's a rumor that they're
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.080]   going to have the be involved with the next nexus that we'll hear about at the end of the month
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:31.800]   likely. So this is probably ramping up to be a big year for Huawei. But interesting, you know,
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:38.040]   kind of an entry for force touch or that type of technology on Android coming from Huawei there,
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.680]   who knows if it's just, you know, dimming along the lines of some of the gimmicky things we've seen
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.600]   some OEMs do to try and move devices, or if it's actually something that everybody's going to want.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.640]   And if that's the case, I think it's probably going to take a couple of years before they figure it out
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.080]   very well. But and who knows how it compares to Apple? Personally, like I said, I'm very
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.800]   clueless when it comes to Apple devices, I just haven't used them very much. I don't know or
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   understand from a used perspective how earth shattering force touch or 3D touch actually is.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.080]   But sounds cool. I wouldn't mind that in all my devices. It looks neat, but and I am tempted by
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.320]   the new iPhone, but I'm also I'm waiting for the Nexus 5. So I'm the market free new phone, my one
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.400]   plus one that there's a strip down the bottom that like the it's breaking. It's not it's not working
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.200]   anymore. So I'm ready. It's that time of year where you put up with your crack screen and broken
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.120]   touchscreen just another week because it's going to be a new phone announced. And I think it's going
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.360]   to be the Nexus the new Nexus the Nexus 5 2015, whatever it's going to be. I'm really looking forward
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.560]   to that. I don't want to see what that's going to be like. So well, and not only is it a new Nexus,
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:44.760]   you actually have a choice, you know, which is which is potentially a big, big differentiator
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.880]   this year versus other years, which is that there will be not one but two Nexus devices introduced,
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:57.640]   the Nexus 5 by LG, and then the Huawei Nexus 6 successor, which I think is actually 5.7
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.680]   inch display fingerprint reader, all that kind of stuff integrated in. So it's an interesting
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.000]   month. This is a totally hardware season. We're in the midst. It's like the leaves are about to
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.040]   start turning colors and phones are going to start dropping. That's right. The phones are right.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:18.360]   They're ready to ready be picked. Exactly. And I'm ready to pick them and maybe review a few of them
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.760]   while we're at it. So, okay, so then this seems like a perfect segue into kind of one of the topics
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.840]   that Gina, you had expressed interest before the show about chatting about. And there's kind of like
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:37.720]   a, I don't know if it's a hardware class war or something along those lines brewing at least
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:43.320]   in terms of Android phones. Apple obviously clearly, you know, they are committed to the high end
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.200]   when it comes to hardware. And we've seen a lot of high end hardware in Android. Samsung has
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:56.600]   reveled in that with their S line of devices. HTC has their 1M, you know, 9 was the latest one.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:03.320]   That would be definitely their premium. Higher end devices, LGG 4, all of those. Second quarter of
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:10.040]   last year was actually not a very good year for high end Android OEMs. None shipped more
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:18.360]   handsets than one year ago. And none of those OEMs made more operating profit than one year ago.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:26.040]   Samsung's S6 performed pretty poorly. Supposedly, the G4 didn't sell very much. Sony has a rocky kind
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.960]   experience in the US to begin with. But I guess there's had been pretty dismal. And now HTC,
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:38.520]   the big news with HTC is that its stock was removed from the Taiwanese TW SE50 index
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:46.520]   after seeing a share price drop of 66% in the past year, which is just kind of crazy. Now suddenly,
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:52.760]   like, and we heard a little while ago that HTC's, you know, monetary situation is that they're
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:58.360]   worth less than their stock is worth. So their company is basically valueless. So we suddenly,
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:04.680]   we're seeing the floor kind of drop out from all of these premium, premium smartphones. So
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.080]   I don't know, it kind of feels like there's a sea change going on, at least in the world of
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:16.520]   Android. How can how can one hand something like Apple be a brand that exists and rebels in kind of
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:22.200]   the high end, but then you have Android kind of struggling in that regard? How's that happen?
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.080]   Well, I think it's following the PC trend. And the same thing happened with PCs, essentially,
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:33.960]   where you can go out and buy a two $250, $300 desktop or netbook or Chromebook.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.400]   At this point, and so, and people are willing to just go do that unless there's a small niche,
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.440]   of course, well, moderate sized niche for gaming enthusiasts and things like that that are willing
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:49.000]   to go pay to build a high end machine. There's, of course, the server enterprise market that's
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.280]   different. But for consumers, you know, everything just got so commoditized. And the applications that
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:16:00.760]   were being written weren't necessarily driving the need for faster and faster hardware at the core.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.560]   So it's like, hey, I've got a phone, you know, I don't have to pay the big bucks to get the
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.880]   features I want anymore. You know, a lot of the mid middle tier phones are coming with decent
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:15.720]   cameras now and plenty of features. My wife is a good example of this. You know, she does not need
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.800]   a high end phone and she doesn't want a high end phone. She just wants one that works reliably
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.280]   through all her her fuffles that she does with her phone and seems like every day. And she just
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.520]   wants it to work. Like, I just want to go to maps have the maps work. As long as it's working,
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.200]   I'm okay. I want to check my mail. I don't want to play words with friends. And I don't need a
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.960]   high end phone anymore. I think a lot of people were at that point now where, you know, the curve
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.440]   is kind of starting to level off in terms of what people need and what people expect. And so
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:46.120]   there's nothing really driving companies, I think, to produce that high end phone. And
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.520]   there's no longer demand or as much demand, I would say for people that are willing to go out
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.440]   and shell out six, seven hundred dollars for a phone when they can buy one for three hundred
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.640]   dollars, it's just as good. Yeah. Then that's exactly what we're seeing right now. Now you're in the
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:07.080]   market, obviously, do you find yourself gravitating towards the higher end or do you feel satisfied
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.520]   with what you're seeing kind of in this mid tier of devices? I mean, I personally would spend extra
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.320]   money to get a premium phone. And but I don't know what that phone would be. Like, so I mean,
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:23.480]   I want to go with Nexus because I want the latest Android stuff. And I know that Google has worked
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:29.560]   with the manufacturer to sort of make this reference, the Nexus still feels kind of like a reference
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:38.760]   device, take advantage of all of Android's new software features. And so I'm going next for that
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:44.120]   reason. But on the other side of higher end devices, Samsung devices, they're just not
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.040]   interesting to me. And this is just because I mean, this is also just because I had sort of an
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.680]   nerdier bent and I'm more interested kind of in the software than the hardware. But I don't think
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.960]   that anyone's quite owned to the high end market for Android. And it feels like part of the reason
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:03.560]   why Apple has been able to do it as well as it has its amazing marketing aside is because it owns
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.280]   both the hardware and the software and can do these sort of coordinated launches like they did
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.040]   today, these announcements. And this was, you know, the S is an incremental kind of upgrade for them.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.760]   It's that, you know, that off year upgrade. And still people, you know, make it's like, this is
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.760]   the thing that you want. This is the thing that you have. This is the, you know, this is the one
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.240]   choice. But having all the different different choices. And I think that, yeah, I mean, I think
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.880]   that having other choices that are medium, I mean, the OnePlus one certainly isn't high end, right?
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.720]   It's it's kind of a mid mid level phone. But I think there are times when I'm like, I really
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.880]   want like the camera that's going to give me a great photo every single time and not make me think
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.840]   about it. So I am willing to spend the extra money. I just don't, I don't think there's a clear
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:48.280]   choice for the for the folks that do want to. Yeah, I mean, what, what I feel like,
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.800]   IFA, that's the word I was trying to find earlier in Berlin from last week. What we're what we're
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:19:01.400]   finding in this trend is right in the sweet spot seems to be like $250 to $400 unlocked. You know,
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:07.720]   you got the Asus Zen phone to Alcatel one touch idle. There's the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2. If you can
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:14.840]   get it, that's actually around 168 US, the OnePlus two for $389 Moto X Pure, which everybody's raving
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:22.280]   about. That's only $400. There's the new blue Pure XL. That's at $349 and check this out. So
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:29.160]   this is my Nexus six. This has been, you know, considered a premium phone for not even a full
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:38.360]   year at this point. It just saw a price drop to $349 for the the 16 gig models of $399 for the 64
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:44.200]   gig model. So which is a great deal. I think that's a fantastic deal. I think there were $699 when
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.280]   they came on. Is that right? What's that? If I remember in Krakat, there was 699. Yes, it was
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.840]   a 600 some odd dollars expensive. Yeah, so I've got I've got mine too.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:59.800]   Suddenly through Gina curveballed, didn't we? Yeah, this is a this is a great phone. I've been
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.600]   noticing lately. I still don't I haven't upgraded to 5.1.1 partly because I'm unlocked and rooted.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:11.400]   So the upgrade process is a little bit harder for me. Harder in general. And I did have
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.720]   a bother with it. But I have noticed like the battery life on this is is somehow getting better.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:20.440]   Some I don't know what it is. And you're not using you don't have any of the developer
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:26.440]   previews from now. No, I'm not running M. I'm just running 5.1.0. Yeah. And I keep noticing like
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.880]   I go to bed at night. I haven't had a plugged in all day. I turn it on. I'm like, Oh, I've still
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.080]   got like 30, you know, percent of weird. We're not fluctuating. Yeah. Yeah. Why that? And you know,
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.600]   I've been and the thing is, it's usually it's when I don't use it. Of course, it's when I don't use
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.040]   a screen as much as when I'm listening to music with the screen off or something like that. But
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.800]   yeah, it's this is great. I think it's I'm so glad to see that they
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.600]   lower their price, not only because that probably means the new models are coming out for sure,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.760]   but also just because for people that are looking for a good phone, it's a great phone
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:00.200]   to pick up for that price, I think. So of course, if you do that, then you're buying into
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.920]   what is soon to be like in less than a month, probably last year's model of Nexus phone and
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.880]   yeah, having said that, the Nexus five, that rocked like pretty much it's still going.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.600]   People that still have it still love it. Nice to love it. Yeah. Yeah, it's a great device. So
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.800]   there's a little bit of extra longevity there that I feel like was hard to come by, even a year or
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:27.560]   two ago. So there's that is this is it? I guess in some ways, it kind of feels like it could be
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.920]   erased to the bottom and that could be kind of damaging. Do you think there's any risk of that
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.000]   here? Like it's just going to keep on going down, keep on going down, and then suddenly the floor
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   is dropping out of the whole category because it can't sustain what people expect out of their
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.040]   devices from a cost perspective. Personally, I do not. I think it's fine. I don't think there's a
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:56.440]   danger in that except and especially because if we were to say the make the same argument about
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:01.320]   Apple, I think there would be a problem there because Apple owns the hardware. But in this case,
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.680]   it's other manufacturers hardware that we're talking about and not apples and they're all
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.440]   competing against each other. And that's probably another reason why we see this is because Apple
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.320]   owns their own markets, so to speak. And what we're seeing with Android is competition between
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:18.680]   different players. And you mentioned HTC going down in market value. And I think what we're seeing
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:23.720]   is the competition is actually driving that price down to. That's another aspect to it. So I don't
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:29.880]   think there's a danger in it at all. If anything, driving the price down will increase adoption.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.640]   And that's a good thing too. So yeah, that's definitely a good thing. Then getting the next
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   billion getting people online that wouldn't have necessarily gotten online otherwise. It concerns
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:45.560]   me a little bit when it feels like the iPhone is what is a status symbol. It is the symbol of a
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.800]   premium device, even though there are plenty of premium Android devices. But the iPhone is the
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.480]   symbol. I mean, that's their tagline right now in their commercial, right? If it's not an iPhone,
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:59.800]   it's not an iPhone, which is the stupidest thing ever. But they're just reinforcing that kind
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.640]   of that perception for the higher end buyers. That concerns me a little. So I don't know,
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:11.880]   I would like to see the premium Android device be super popular, maybe the clear winner. But
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.000]   maybe that's it. That's not how it's supposed to be with Android. There's supposed to be lots of
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.480]   different choices. And they're supposed to be really affordable devices that anyone can get to.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:25.480]   But it is interesting to see the separation. It does feel like there is this separation. This
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.400]   gap is getting bigger. It's like a little bit of a class war, especially kind of what you're
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:39.080]   talking about, the kind of the social interpretation of what it means as a symbol of having an iPhone
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.360]   or an iOS device versus having one of those Android devices. Like I think I read a couple of reviews
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.720]   that were like, "Well, of course Samsung's having issues selling the S6. Why would anyone want to buy
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:55.960]   a copycat of the iPhone at the same price of an iPhone when you can just get an iPhone for that
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:01.880]   price?" Which kind of means that anything of quality on the Android side must be lower than
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:09.080]   an iOS device because iOS is at the top when it comes to that kind of class war.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.800]   That's kind of... I don't know that. I mean, I'm not a Android fan that kind of hurts.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.040]   It does. But I've said this before on other shows. And I think that most of the people that I see
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:23.720]   running, no offense, folks, but most of the people I see holding an iPhone in their hand are my age
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.920]   or older. I don't see a lot of younger folks running iPhones unless it's because their parents got that
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.920]   for them. Or their parents upgraded. Right. Because I've got a teenager. I've got a 16 year old at home.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.920]   So I always ask the kids that come over and they're like, "Oh, do you have an Apple charger?" And I'm
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:43.640]   like, "No, sorry." And I ask them, "Well, what did you get that for?" And they say, "Oh, that's my mom
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:49.480]   got it for me because she has one or something like that." So I don't know. I think eventually,
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.760]   Apple's going to run into an issue here where if they're not reaching the younger audience that
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.520]   upgrades their phones more often and wants to do that, I think that may be a little bit of an issue
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.480]   because I think Android, and that's another reason why the cheapness of it plays well. If you're
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:08.200]   a starving college student, even though you may want a nicer phone, you may not be able to afford
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.400]   it. But you can definitely go down and afford the $99 Android phone. And over time, I think that's
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:18.680]   going to hurt or dig into Apple's ability to broaden their market and increase their numbers.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:24.120]   Yeah. No matter what, you're getting the internet, the world's information in your pocket.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:30.600]   That's pretty impressive. For $99 for $50 for $700 whatever. That's pretty oppressive that we have
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:36.440]   this conundrum right now. Absolutely. Let's take a quick break and thank our first sponsor. And
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.480]   then when we come back, we're actually going to talk about something that's totally related
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.120]   to this. And that is the Chinese market, which is a huge market right now that everybody's trying
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:49.320]   to figure out how they can get into without sacrificing company ethos and all that kind of stuff. It's
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.680]   a very challenging problem. There's a lot going on there. But before we continue, let's take a minute
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:26:01.640]   to thank ZipperKruder. So ZipperKruder is just, it's a fantastic tool for business owners, basically.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.760]   Summertime is always kind of rounding out at this point. We're kind of approaching the end of
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:13.000]   the summer. But this has been a fantastic time to hire some of the best people, competitors.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.200]   You know, there on vacation, there's a lot less competition for all those quality candidates.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.960]   And when you're looking for someone to fill a position, that's what you want. You want quality
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:28.520]   candidates. Posting jobs in one place usually isn't enough to find those quality candidates.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:34.680]   And you know, short staffing kind of leaves a little bit of time to post to dozens of job sites.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.480]   I mean, there are so many of them around the internet. It's practically a full-time job just
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:46.520]   posting your job to all of these sites. Thanks to ZipperKruder.com, you can actually post to 100
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:52.920]   plus job sites, all with one single click. Kind of taking care of it for you. Be instantly matched
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:59.800]   to candidates from over nearly 6 million resumes. ZipperKruder is a fantastic tool here. They kind
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:05.000]   of make it easy for you. So you don't have to hire someone full-time just to hire that other
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.800]   position. Just post once. Within 24 hours, you can watch your candidates. Just kind of roll into
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:16.440]   ZipperKruder's easy to use in her face. And ZipperKruder has actually been used by over 400,000

[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:27.160]   important. We don't have to tell you that. Janet, a happy ZipperKruder client, actually said,
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:33.000]   "I was looking for two positions at my marketing agency and received 100 plus resumes in a single
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.600]   month and found most of the resumes to be spot on and well matched to our request." We filled the
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:46.200]   jobs and would use ZipperKruder again without hesitation. It obviously worked for Janet. It's
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.080]   worked for so many businesses. You guys should check it out. Today, you can try ZipperKruder

[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:17.320]   And we thank ZipperKruder for their support of this week in Google. Okay, so a lot of stuff happening
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:23.080]   when it comes to tech companies in China here. A few things kind of converging all at once.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:31.000]   I'm probably going to slaughter this, but back in 2010, Google had to pull out of China. Basically,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.280]   there was suspicion of cyber attacks from the area that Google's cautious about. And then also,
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:45.800]   this kind of ongoing battle with search censorship. China has since blocked access to Google. It's
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:51.480]   also actually blocked access to Facebook. And times seem to be changing. Google and China have
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:58.040]   struck a strategic partnership that'll allow Android Wear to come to China for the very first
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:04.680]   time. And place of Google services, voice service will actually be provided by MoV or MoVoy. I'm
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:10.920]   probably not saying that properly. And mapping provided by Sugu. This is the first time that
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:17.320]   Wear has been stripped of its Google underpinnings. So that's kind of significant. Wear has, you know,
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:23.560]   is directly tied into Google's services. And suddenly we're starting to see a little, you know,
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:28.280]   a little bit of loosening in that front. This along with a report from the information that
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:34.360]   shows how Google is willing to make changes to its policy in order to once again gain access
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.920]   to the Chinese market, which happens to be the world's largest internet market. So you can see
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:43.880]   why it's a big deal. And hopefully gain control over that marketplace, which is just filled with
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.840]   forked Android devices throughout the country. Google would need to, of course, follow local
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:55.880]   laws in order to do that, block apps and content that the Chinese government sees as objectionable.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.760]   Stop right there. There's more to this story, but we can kind of stop right there and talk about
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:07.000]   it a little bit. Does this, does this seem like Google's going back on its own commitment to not
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.040]   being evil? It seems like Google was taking a stance from kind of from a humanitarian aspect
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.280]   back in 2010, when all this stuff started happening. And now it seems like that's reversing
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:25.560]   because business is important. Do we understand? Is this Google be an evil? What do you think, Gina?
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:33.000]   I don't think that the evil switch has been flipped. I think that like this is a delicate dance.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.320]   Like, like a really important place that's undergoing. I think some changes over time,
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.560]   based solely on my like very short visit visits to China. I think China is changing. Things are
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:49.160]   changing. And I think that Google has to be there. And I think that this is a delicate dance. It's
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:53.400]   going to be lots of conversations. It's going to be lots of negotiations. And I think that it's
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.920]   the right thing for them, business-wise. I mean, look, you can take the absolute radical, no, we
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:05.000]   won't even speak to you position. And I think that's the wrong one to take forever and ever.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.960]   Right? I mean, I think this is kind of, this is an ongoing negotiation. So I didn't read this and
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.760]   think, oh, they went back in the world. They're evil. Right? Like, that's not a very new one,
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:20.440]   view on this. It's interesting to see. I mean, I'm interested from the software perspective.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:26.200]   Like, it's really interesting to me to see the way that Google separates Google services
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.920]   from the open source version of Android and how they separate those things. And so,
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.880]   what they're offering to Chinese users and what advantage that brings them, what advantage
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.440]   it brings to Chinese users. I mean, this is going to be an extremely delicate, incremental
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:46.600]   dance in the next few years. But I think that this is generally a good thing. And I don't think
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.960]   it's just about business. I mean, it is about business. I mean, certainly it's about market
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:56.360]   share. But I don't think it's about them turning evil. My being too easy on them,
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.920]   my being too much more legal fan, I might be. I mean, I think if you go back to when they
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:06.040]   got kicked out or whatever you want to call it, I mean, how are you going to spend that as a
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.800]   company? Right? When you have to put a positive spin on it. So one way to do that, and I don't
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:16.120]   think this is not true. Right? I just think that you emphasize that positive part of your message,
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.880]   right, as a marketer. And so the positive part of their message back then was, well,
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:25.000]   you know, in China, there's these things and we want to stay above board and blah, blah, but,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.600]   you know, really, it's about doing business in China. And if you're not able to do business in
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.040]   China, you just have to put the best spin on it. Now it's like, oh, well, we can get back into
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.880]   China. I mean, you have to, you have to, you know, for better or worse, I mean, certainly,
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.400]   there are some extreme circumstances that you're probably going to have to make that call as a
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.880]   company. But I mean, India and China, I mean, you're just going to have to play there if you
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:49.320]   want to take it to the next level or find a way to do that. And, you know, it's not like
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.680]   Google's like entering the North Korean market, even if they could, you know, it's not like
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.120]   they're saying that. It's just that they're saying, hey, look, you know, there's a big market there.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.960]   We want to be a player. We want to have let people have access to our products. And so
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.880]   that's what we're doing. That's the way I read it.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.120]   Yeah. And this can kind of put it into perspective. Apple actually during their
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:17.000]   bevel, you know, their huge number of announcements today announced the iPhone market grew 75%
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.760]   year over year in China, which is its second largest market after the Americas.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:29.080]   Economic slowdown in the region could mean that those, you know, iPhone sales are going to drop,
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:34.440]   which could be a great opportunity for the lower cost Android devices. Of course, Google
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:39.800]   would love for those lower cost Android devices to be running its services and not,
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:45.080]   you know, be forked versions because then they can actually kind of capitalize off of that,
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.840]   obviously. And then finally, and this just broke shortly before the show,
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:54.840]   New York Times reported today that a meeting of Chinese president Xi Jinping, I believe,
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:34:01.960]   during his first US visit next month is being planned invites out to top executives from Apple,
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:07.160]   Facebook, IBM, Uber, as well as, of course, Google. The topic will be industry cooperation
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:13.880]   between the US and China, along with big companies from both countries. So there's a lot of movement
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:18.360]   suddenly going on. And it seems like probably what we're going to see if, you know, all this kind of
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:25.800]   comes together is Google making some, making some, I'm sure, difficult decisions for the company
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.880]   based on its history with wanting to kind of keep things open and keep search, you know, keep it
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:37.160]   all free and all that and unfiltered. But, you know, if they want to play in the second largest
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:42.760]   internet market in the world, they're going to, there's obviously something's got to give. And so
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.400]   we're probably going to see that sometime in the near future, I would guess.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:50.920]   I mean, it's important to remember how much China, how important China is to the Android market
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:56.200]   anyway, because China, most of the hardware that we run our software on comes from China to begin
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:02.280]   with, right? So like, you know, it's like, it makes sense that the software should be, should be
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.520]   there as well. So I think this is a good thing. I think conversations and negotiations and meetings
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:11.640]   are about cooperation are a good thing for everyone. Yeah. I hope they go well.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:18.760]   I wonder if any of this is made easier with the transition into alphabet and kind of splitting
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:24.360]   things up. I don't know for sure what the answer would be on that. But, you know, that was kind of
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:29.560]   part of the reason I think Google gave for splitting, you know, splitting everything off and creating
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:35.640]   alphabet was that certain things that might have seemed outside of the realm of understanding
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.040]   from a company like Google, then suddenly makes sense when Google is just a company
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.880]   under something bigger like alphabet. And maybe this falls into that category. Maybe that makes
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:49.960]   a little bit easier. I don't know. Speaking of the alphabet, let's talk a little bit more about the
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:56.040]   logo. We did actually Leo and the gang spent a good amount of time on the logo last week. So
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:02.600]   we don't need to discuss it to great depth. But I'm sure, you know, our opinions haven't been
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:07.560]   heard about it yet. And it's been a good, nice, solid week. The new car smell is kind of faded.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:14.040]   And we've kind of our eyeballs have adjusted. You may notice down there that we have an updated
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:20.440]   this week in Google logo with font. Whoa, and it's growing. I'm impressed. Anthony Nielsen here at
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:27.560]   Twitter, redesigned the logo to more or less match the actual logo from Google. I think it's a great
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:33.000]   job. It's not a straight borrowing of the actual logo. So we had to kind of recreate it. But I think
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.280]   it looks awesome. And thank you, Anthony. Yeah, thank you. So the new logo has complicated
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.960]   serifs. It actually results check this out in a six kilobyte file that's compressed all the way
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.560]   down to two kilobytes. Sorry, that's that's the old one. The old the old logo compresses down to
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:37:00.040]   two kilobytes. The new logo is only 305 bytes. What the font? Can you believe it? Because things
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:06.440]   like serifs and stuff are kind of complications within the font. And this new logo, as you can
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.000]   tell, and as a lot of people actually seem to hate is that it's really simple. It's really straightforward.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.800]   It's just a bunch of circles for the most part with a couple of slanted lines. Yep, it's all about
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:22.120]   compression, compressibility. If Google wants to get anything to your device in a place where
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:28.200]   your connection's really bad, it's at least the logo. That's true. We're seeing everything get
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:35.000]   restylized. Like just today, Google Plus rolled out its new new logo style and everything. I don't
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.880]   know if you've seen on do I have it on my Nexus six? Yeah, I've got it. Oh, I don't have it. Yeah,
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.840]   you don't have the Google Plus? I have it on my five. I don't have. Oh, no, I was going to show
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:49.320]   the search bar. The search bar. I do have that as well. Except I don't know if I have a camera
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:55.400]   that's tight enough to get this. Yeah, there we go. You can see it. You can see the Google
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.480]   the logo, obviously. But then also, I've noticed even in maps, I don't know if you saw that today
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:07.320]   or yesterday, even in maps, they've updated all of the associated logos like the microphone here.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:14.360]   And if I do, of course, the maps itself has changed. And then if I do, let me go, let me see if it
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.760]   has it. They've got their logo there. And I thought I saw something else. I don't know.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.040]   I thought there was something else. Oh, well, I thought there was something else in maps as well
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:28.680]   that I saw that had the updated logo. So it's just popping up everywhere. In Chrome, in the browser,
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:33.320]   I've noticed a couple of things that had the logo updated. So they're really-- The fave icon.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.320]   Yeah, the fave icon. Yeah, they're just going on. I just wanted to show that the logo was fine with
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.760]   him, but that the fave icon made him want to throw a chair through the Google Plus window.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:46.040]   This is so funny because we all look at our tabs all day long. And that's like such a--
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.600]   Yeah, that's true. It is a jarring change. We've been so used to it one way for so long.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.560]   I mean, people are getting really like, wow, people spend a lot of time watching fonts.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.960]   The New York Times actually compared Google's logo change to that of New Coke versus Coke.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:06.760]   Remember, Quickseter versus Netflix. I forgot about Quickseter. I forgot that that was even
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:15.080]   the thing. I did too. That's just-- It's crazy. That is totally great. So I'm kind of the perspective
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.640]   of someone who's been looking at material for a long time. So the new logo didn't feel that
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.480]   jarring or surprising. I was like, oh, that feels very material. And yeah, it's really different.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.880]   And I'm not a typography expert, but I've been making software for a long time. And I have gone
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:34.520]   through firsthand the sort of user revolts to change. And that particular piece that New York
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:39.080]   Times-- it was a New Yorker piece, that particular New Yorker piece about how bad the logo really is.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:43.640]   Just-- I read the whole thing. It was thousands of words. And all I could hear was like, I hate
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:48.360]   change. Wawa, I hate change. I mean, people just hate change. You know, it's natural. It's human to
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:56.280]   hate change. But I think in this particular case, it's like, I had not a big deal. I like it. I think
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:01.400]   it's clean. I think it's modern. It is slightly childish. But Google's always had a very whimsical,
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:06.440]   little like kind of child-like aspect to the company. I think it's very reflective of the
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:12.200]   brand. And I have to say that I think that Google's advances in design in the past few years have
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:17.240]   been amazing, have been great materials, an incredible design system. And I really love this
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:22.440]   logo design system. I think it's very mobile friendly. And I think it works. But it's funny.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.200]   It's just funny that a week later, people are still ruminating about how much they hate.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:32.200]   I will say that I wish that the microphone on my home screen was not color. Like that felt a little
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.240]   bit-- You hear that from people a lot. Yeah. And I wonder if that's one of those things that'll
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:41.560]   just kind of get used to it. It goes to show how much we stare at Google logos. If people are
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:46.200]   disconcerted about it-- Because obviously we use Google a lot and we see it everywhere because
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:53.400]   in Don't Mind seeing the change or we can't stand it every time we happen to glance at it.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:41:01.000]   We called it before the show started. We were calling it the crayon font. Or as Gina would say,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:10.600]   crayon. The crayon. The crayon. The crayon. Two syllables. I say crayon. It does feel a little
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   childish to me. I mean, it does feel a little bit more like I'm using a kid's phone when I,
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:20.920]   especially with the mic icon. So I think there's a danger here of them taking this a little too far.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.480]   Like sometimes when you come out with a new branding program for a company, everyone jumps
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.840]   on board and they're like, "Oh, we're going to change everything. Oh, look at this. I styled
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:33.720]   this just to look like the new logo. Blah, blah, blah." They could take it a little too far. It could
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.920]   get carried away. So I think there's a little bit danger in that. But I agree with Mike P in the chat
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:44.280]   room who said, "I like the old one better. I don't like the new one, but who cares? It's a logo."
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:52.360]   Yeah, absolutely. I kind of thought it has a alphabet, the tie to alphabet, it kind of obviously
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.680]   makes sense. I think when you're talking about it, looking a little bit kidlike and childish.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:03.800]   Oh, there we go. But that's alphabet with Sarah font. That is so like a week and a half ago.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:12.280]   But also like weren't Sere gay and Larry weren't they Montessori kids? And I don't know if they
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   were Montessori kids. So I know for some reason in my brain, I'm like, yeah, it makes sense that
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:22.520]   they do that. Yes, the company is whimsical and operates kind of in the Montessori way.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:26.600]   That's obviously their background. So it all kind of works together. I like the logo.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.560]   There we go. That's all anybody needs to know is that we three, we think it's all right.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.880]   We twig has officially embraced the logo and our logo has been updated. So deal with it.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:43.400]   Yeah, deal with it. I need the glasses. Deal with it. Let's see here. Did you guys see the
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.880]   Motorola watches? We talked about it, I think a little bit on last week's show, but the new
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:54.040]   Moto 360 watches that Motorola unveiled. Yeah. I heard about it, but I didn't look into it.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:58.120]   I want that sport watch. When's that going to get released? I went looking for it and it's
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:02.520]   apparently they haven't given details on one. That's going to be released. They just kind of
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:07.320]   showed it off. The sport does look very interesting. They actually had another watch that they were
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:13.240]   potentially going to release. I guess a blog post by a Motorola engineer revealed that an even lower
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:20.280]   cost kid friendly version of the Moto 360 was in the works, didn't make the cut with last week's
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:26.840]   announcements. It would have been what they're calling a value tier smart watch and super bright
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:32.040]   colors and perfect for kids. I think some of the pictures show the back and it looks like maybe
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:37.960]   some of the materials are of a lower quality. I don't know. I like their strategy though with
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:44.440]   the Moto 360. Actually, it's not just Motorola. It's some of the other watches that are being
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:50.440]   unveiled of the new era of Android Wear watches that we're entering into for the next year.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:56.040]   They're realizing that not everybody's wrist is the same size. They're giving you some choice
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.880]   options as far as size is concerned. I think that's kind of important.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.920]   I'm just looking at these a little bit more closely. They look a little bit like, I mean,
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:06.680]   it doesn't have the same mechanism, but it looks a little bit like a swatch watch.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.600]   Yeah. Remember swatch watches? The 80s?
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:14.600]   Yeah, I wonder if it's meant for kids, and does that mean that your kid would also be carrying
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:20.360]   around a phone that's syncing to their watch? That was my question. I'm like kids. Kids,
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.960]   like what? Not how old or what are we talking about? Are we talking about high school kids?
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:29.880]   Yeah. Kids that are already carrying phones, and what are they doing with the watch? I don't know.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.920]   And then whatever, I got into this existential question. I'm like, well, what do I do with the
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:38.680]   watch? And would I get one of these for my kid? I don't know. I'm just imagining my kid sitting
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:45.880]   in class getting Instagram likes notifications on her wrist, getting distracted. So I don't know,
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:51.480]   Jason, would you get a smart watch for one of your kids if she were 12, 13, 14?
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:56.200]   Sure. If she wanted one, I think that's the question.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   Kids, especially 13, 14, 15, they're very opinionated. Are they going to want to wear a Motorola,
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:07.880]   true flashy color watch at that point? I don't know. They're probably going to want to step it
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:12.440]   up a little bit, but maybe I don't understand 13, 14, and 15 year olds very well. My five-year-old
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:17.000]   has a watch, but it's a very cheap watch. And I'm okay with that because she's probably going to
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.960]   destroy it. Oh, yeah. Does she want to watch? Does she want to watch? Yes, she does. She asks for one.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:28.680]   Because she sees me wear my Moto 360. And, you know, and every once in a while, she'll come up and
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.920]   she'll just start touching the screen, which is kind of annoying. But, you know, she sees me
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:37.240]   wearing that watch. My wife wears a watch. She's in fitness, so she wears it to time certain things.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:41.160]   And yeah, she wanted to watch. And it's helped her tell the time, but it's the old-fashioned.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   It's not a digital. It's like the hands. Yeah, with hands. I know. Yeah. What is going on here?
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.560]   Motorola probably made the right decision cutting this value to your kids watch.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:46:00.120]   At this point in time, maybe five years from now, that would be a kids watch or just a low-end value
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.120]   tier. Sure. That's what you're calling it. It would make more sense. Sure. I can see with these,
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.400]   you know, the band, I think they're missing an opportunity here. The band should be like
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:15.160]   Avengers or Batman or... You know what I mean? Yeah, no, no. Hey, there's options. Something like
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:20.120]   that. I mean, if it's really going to be marketed to kids, I mean, I don't know. I can see that. I
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:24.680]   can see buying, you know, when I was a kid, I had underoos and maybe now it's smartwatches.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.600]   I don't know. It's a smartwatch band. Yeah, it's a smartwatch band. Yeah. It's a new underoos.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:35.160]   I'm not sure that's the marketing angle that they want to take, but would you like that, Sloog?
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:44.520]   I think it'll work. Along the watch tip of things, Samsung unveiled what was expected from them
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:49.720]   at the IFA conference in Berlin last week. Though they didn't unveil it in the main presentation,
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:54.200]   which is kind of interesting. The Samsung Gear S2, it's a round face watch,
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:47:00.600]   round watch face, stainless steel body, small size, and it's not actually running Android Wear.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:07.320]   We kind of heard hints of this as running Samsung's Tizen OS, but Samsung's doing something a little
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:12.520]   bit different here. It has compatibility with all Android devices, not just Samsungs. Oh,
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:17.960]   I thought it was only Samsung. I missed that. Which is great. It newer Android devices,
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:23.560]   as they said. Okay. Okay. And Samsung's also looking into iOS compatibility.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:31.080]   So Samsung kind of embracing the thought that they might actually sell more of this type of
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:37.240]   accessory style hardware if they open it up to more than just Samsung users. I like that from
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:42.120]   you, Samsung. Because I've always thought a lot of their components and their accessories and
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:48.200]   whatever are kind of neat. But you're seeing how you're limiting yourself. Galaxy. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.600]   Yeah. Yeah. That seems like a late revelation, but glad that it happened. Yeah.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:59.320]   So what's interesting about this is it has a bezel. So the round bezel essentially rotates.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:06.920]   And that's what you use for navigation through the S2. It also has NFC on board for Samsung Pay.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.960]   So that'll come in really handy. Samsung Pay. You saw there you go. You see a little bit of the
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:18.360]   rotating bezel in parts of the video anyways. It has 3G and non 3G versions. Yeah, there you go.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:24.280]   Supposedly is very responsive with the rotating bezel. So that's cool. And yeah, but it's going
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:29.880]   to be a little expensive. Apparently the placeholder on the site has it around 379 euros to start,
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:38.280]   which is around $420. $420. Wow. Up to around $500 US. Those prices might fluctuate.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.040]   You know, might go downward once we get official pricing in the US, but
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:48.360]   Yeah. So I'm like torn because it's a nice looking watch. Yeah. I would say from the videos
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:53.800]   and the pictures I've seen, it's one of the nicer looking watches compared to what's available
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:49:01.320]   right now. I mean, it looks about the same as the Huawei watch. The Huawei watch. In terms of looks,
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:05.080]   but I haven't held it in my hands or anything, but I mean, just based on what I see, it looks
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.720]   like about the same. Yeah. And the one we want to know. No flat tire with a relatively small bezel.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:16.040]   Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think that's because it's the different. I think it's on OLED screen versus
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:22.840]   the Moto 360's LCD screen and that ambient light sensor has to be facing forward
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:29.080]   on the LCD screens along those lines. So, you know, Motorola is sticking to its flat tire
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:33.400]   philosophy. I don't know. It doesn't bug me though. Does it bug you guys? Yeah, it does. Yeah.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:38.040]   Absolutely. It does bug me as much as I thought it would.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:44.440]   Yeah. I stopped noticing it. And I do prefer the round. Like I looked at the new Moto 360's
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.400]   and was like, yeah, I want one of these. The sports in particular, I was like, I want one of these,
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:53.320]   you know, even with the flat tire, but we'll buy again. So, I think it's just it.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:58.920]   Oh, nice. Excellent. Thank you. See, this is why we need Brian on all the shows,
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:05.320]   because he can do things like that out of nowhere. Absolutely. And then finally, before we take a
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:10.840]   break related to Samsung, I thought this was kind of cool. So, we've heard a lot about Samsung Pay.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:17.560]   We've heard about how it works with pretty much any, you know, contact or, you know,
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:23.000]   any payment center, essentially, anything that can accept a card swipe, Samsung Pay is supposed to
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.760]   work with because it basically blasts out kind of electromagnetic field and essentially sends
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:34.360]   your credit card data through that way, imitating a card, essentially, without actually having to
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:43.240]   swipe through. There's video someone got Sam took Samsung Pay for a spin at a retailer to kind of
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:49.560]   show how it works using it looks like an S6 edge. And it's quite literally like the easiest thing
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:55.960]   in the world. Like it works exactly like any other contactless, like NFC payment, but I saw one of
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:01.000]   these for Android Pay this week too. Similar video. Yeah, this is Samsung Pay. This is Samsung Pay.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:07.960]   Okay. So, yeah, so using the loop pay technology. Yeah. And this is a terminal that is not set up
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:14.040]   to accept any payments. Yeah. It's just a normal terminal. That's cool. That is cool. That is cool.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:19.320]   I kind of feel like that's what we need on all the phones. Like, and I don't know, but maybe NFC
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:23.800]   will become so ubiquitous that it will matter. Let's hope so. I love using my phone to pay for
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.880]   stuff. And it's still it still wows people. They're like, Oh, I don't know you could do that, you
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:32.920]   know, and it's like it's been out for years. But it's so much easier. In fact, I was someplace the
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.840]   other day and I had forgotten my wallet. I think it was going through McDonald's or something. And
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.720]   we had all the kids in the back. Everybody's hungry. It was like, okay, we'll just go through
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.240]   McDonald's and get all this food and everything and get up there and I'm like, Oh crap, I forgot my
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:46.840]   wallet. So I just pulled up my phone. I'm like, Oh yeah, it's McDonald's. Can you just scan my phone?
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:52.920]   She's like, sure, done. So excellent. That's the wallet save the day for me for sure. Yeah,
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:58.120]   that's that's my problem is I forget to use it. And then because it's not every single place,
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:02.360]   it's not a no brainer. So then you actually have to figure like, do I get my wallet?
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:07.000]   I forgot my wallet today. So maybe it would come in handy. Maybe I'd be forced to use it in this
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.120]   race. I'm just not going to buy anything instead. But you might want to buy this. Let's take a
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:20.760]   break. Thank our second sponsor of today's episode. And that is the ring video doorbell.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:27.240]   Now I have a ring video doorbell that I connected to my house a few months ago, super easy installation.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:33.240]   And I'm loving it. It is super cool. Basically allows you to use your smartphone to see
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:38.920]   who's at your door. It's literally a video doorbell. Somebody rings your door and rings at your door.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:45.720]   And the app for ring pulls up a little notification and says somebody's at your door. And you go ahead
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:50.120]   and click through and it'll give you the video readout. And you can either accept or deny. And
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:54.360]   if I hit accept, I can actually talk to them and I see them talking to me and I hear them talking
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:59.160]   to me. My kids love to run up to it and just hit the button because they know dad might answer,
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:05.320]   which is hilarious, sometimes annoying, but mostly hilarious. It's very easy to install. They
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:09.560]   give you the whole kit, as you can see right here, the drill bit, they give you a nice little level
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:14.920]   so that you can just drop it right into place, make sure that it's nice and level. And then
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:22.520]   this is the video doorbell. Somebody hits that. It chimes. If you have an additional accessory
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:28.440]   inside the ring chime, which I did purchase myself, so I have one of those inside, it'll ring that
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:33.560]   same doorbell inside. If I don't have my smartphone on me, I'll hear that. Or it can kind of connect
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:39.560]   into your existing doorbell setup. So if you already have a bell installed inside,
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:43.640]   you can just wire it into this and it will ring a doorbell like any other doorbell would.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:48.280]   And it has proprietary screws. So you're kind of wondering like, oh, can't someone just walk up
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:54.040]   and unscrew it and take it with them? And oh, here I'll show that to you. It's that little
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:59.480]   proprietary screw bit that locks it in place. Make sure that they can't take off with it.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:04.840]   So it's just really cool. 95% of home break-ins happen during the day. That's why you need
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.920]   something like this. It's a great security tool. You can set it up for motion detection if you
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:13.960]   want and kind of set the range. Or you can just have it be a doorbell. And when someone rings the
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:21.000]   door, you'll see it. You know, it's got night vision LEDs really, really performs well at night
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.560]   when there's no light outside. You can still see everything nice and sharply sharp enough
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:31.560]   to understand what's going on. And yeah, the install is just super quick. Very easy. I'm loving it.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:37.240]   It's a lot of fun. And I enjoy the random calls for my kids while I'm at work. It's usually when
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:41.800]   I'm doing all that Android and they're getting home from school. But every once in a while, I
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:48.920]   scare them and they think it's hilarious. So if you want to check out the ring video doorbell,
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:53.080]   I think that you should. Time magazine thinks that you should. They named it one of the top 10
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:55:01.480]   gadgets of 2014. And yeah, it's just a lot of fun. Right now you can get $10 off the normal price of
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:06.520]   the ring video doorbell. Protect your home, have peace of mind with ring. All you got to do is go
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:15.320]   to ring.com/twig and you'll get $10 off the normal price. That's ring.com/twig. Check it out for
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:19.320]   yourself. You're going to have a lot of fun with this and it's going to protect your home. So it's
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:23.640]   a great investment. And we thank ring for their support of this week in Google.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:30.440]   All right. Hey, you brought in some hardware, Aaron. As you are want to do, and I love that.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:35.480]   Because it's like when we bring Aaron, new, come on to a show, we're partially getting your brain.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.600]   And then we're suddenly seeing what you've been working on the past couple of weeks. That's
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.040]   exactly what it is. It's like, what are you even doing since we saw you? Well, let me show you.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:46.200]   I know. I brought it with you fine time to build these things. It's all like after hours,
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.600]   you know, we hours of the money stuff. It is. It's a lot of fun. That's cool. So what you got here?
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:55.160]   Okay. So this is my project. This is my thing that I actually bring in here. Let's see if I can
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:01.880]   get this. Here we go. So this is actually the backup entry access system for our makerspace,
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:07.080]   which I've been working on for a while. So it uses an Arduino. The great thing about this. So I
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:13.720]   love projects that reuse technology to keep them out of the landfill. And I also like projects that
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:20.360]   are cheap because I'm a cheapskate. So this satisfies both of those because I'm reusing some stuff
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:27.160]   and the stuff is cheap. These are Dweinos you can get on eBay or sometimes Amazon for less than
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:31.880]   $5, especially if you get them in bulk. So this is a become a really, really cheap platform. Some
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.560]   of these are knockoffs. I know I'm sorry about that. But again, I'm a cheapskate. So I'll just go for
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:40.760]   that. So anyway, there's really, really cheap development platform. There's a real time clock
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:45.240]   here. If you're wondering what that is, it's a real time clock to keep time because Arduino,
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:49.400]   once you unplug it, it's done. It doesn't have a real time clock built in or battery built in.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:54.440]   So I needed that as part of the system here. And then of course, I recycled this number pad.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:59.720]   This is a PS2 number pad that you used to have to buy when you're keyboard, if you got a keyboard
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:03.320]   without a number pad or I don't know, you want an extra number pad, one for each hand. I don't
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:09.720]   know why. But you can find these things in sometimes you can find them in flea markets or I found this
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:16.360]   one in a computer PC supply warehouse for less than $5. So this whole thing costs about $15.
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:23.320]   And what it does is it allows you to implement a secret code system that would unlock your door.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:27.400]   So we have an electronic door on our front door at the makerspace. And what I can do is I can
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:33.960]   hook the Arduino up to a relay so that when you enter the correct code on the keypad here and
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:39.080]   press enter, it'll actually unlock the door. And it's just a backup system. You can run this off
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:44.040]   of a solar or wind power. You can hook up to a battery and just run it that way so that you don't
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:48.360]   if you're off the grid, for example, the way we typically do the door system is there's an RFID
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:52.840]   key that's hooked up to a Raspberry Pi. You scan the RFID key, it looks up in a database, but there's
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:57.000]   all these moving parts. And if the power goes out, that's that could be a problem because the door
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.320]   wouldn't open from the outside if someone wanted to come in. So this is the backup system. It runs a
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:07.240]   very simple, well, not very simple, a relatively simple program. And you what I'm going to do is
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:11.880]   I'm going to post this on GitHub so people can put in their own key system, their own algorithm.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:17.720]   So for example, you might use part of the date or part of the time, along with, you know, so many
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:22.760]   digits of Pi to come up with some sort of unique number that only you know. And then someone,
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.200]   you can give that code to someone they'll enter it and then it'll change. Kind of like how Google
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:30.760]   does when you sign on from a new computer. If you have two factor authentication on, it'll send
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:35.160]   you a passcode. And you'll have to put in that passcode to make sure you are who you say you are.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:39.320]   This would this algorithm works similarly, but you're able to tinker with that on your own and
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:43.960]   either make it as simple or as complex as you want. So we can try this. The way this will work is
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:49.560]   if it's working, I'm going to give you a code. Okay, Jason, you're going to put this in and
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:55.880]   what should happen is, yeah, here we go, right? What should happen is on the Raspberry Pi,
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:59:01.240]   you should see the green light blink solid for three seconds. If it doesn't work, you'll see it
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:06.360]   blink twice in quick succession. So why don't you put in a random four digit code and press enter.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:13.080]   So you did it blink twice? I missed it. I was looking at my fingers. Try again, try again.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:19.720]   Yes, it did. It did. I saw a little green, blinky things. Okay, so now I'm going to put in the
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:27.720]   my super secret code. And if I do this right, you should be able to type in the code 4896.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:34.760]   Enter and press enter. And we get a solid light. I don't know if you can say solid for three seconds.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:38.440]   And that's emulating what would happen with our door lock actually. The door lock would
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:42.680]   unlock for three seconds. You'd be able to go in and then it would lock back up. That's the way
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:47.880]   that works. So if you're interested, it's just an interesting cheap hack that you can do at home.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:51.400]   You can actually take the keypad out of this and put it into your own case if you want to.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:58.040]   And I'm going to be putting the code up on GitHub. Once I obfuscate some of the parts in there,
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.560]   put in some more variables and obfuscate some of the code that I want people seeing.
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.320]   But I'll put this up on GitHub and anybody should be able to implement this. Like I say,
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:10.360]   for under $20, it should be kind of a fun project. You could build this into lockbox for your kid.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:15.800]   You could make some sort of a treasure chest. And this would be the secret code that you have to.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:20.600]   Oh man, that's a great idea. Yeah, like a treasure hunt.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.600]   Right, right. At the very end of it, it's the piece of the puzzle together.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:28.200]   They know the code exactly. So there's lots of cool little ways you could use this.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:33.400]   And it's a fun, cheap project to do. So anyway, that's the project I thought I'd show off for today.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:39.320]   So when you do a project like this, do you set out to solve a particular thing or like like
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.240]   like a particular need in your life? Yes. You know what I need is this thing.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.760]   I'm going to see if I can build it for $20. Yeah, well, not just for $20.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.680]   But let's see if it's feasible to do this in a cheap way. You know, I mean, we would probably
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.200]   do this if it was $20, $30, $100. We probably still would have done it anyway.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.720]   Just because we need to have that backup system because that's what we're offering our members,
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:02.360]   is 24/7 access. If you don't have that, then you're kind of not fulfilling your part of the bargain.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:06.600]   So we probably would have done it anyway, but it's cool to reuse electronics in a way for me anyway,
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:11.000]   in new projects and kind of bring them back to life or use them in a way that
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.040]   just to keep them out of the landfill, like I said, just to reuse it in new and interesting ways.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:24.360]   So love it. And I'm about to reap the benefits of your handiwork as well because
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:31.480]   you got your errands arcade is hopefully coming soon to me. And I'll be back on the
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:37.000]   new screen savers sometime in the next month or two, Deyami Polaki and on the east coast
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:44.680]   is a woodworker that is basically building the cab, the, what is it, tabletop main cabinet for me.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.760]   And he's also mounting all the components. So it's been a project that's at this point
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.760]   been months in the coming, which is just going to make it that much sweeter when I finally have it
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.080]   and can do all the wiring. But maybe we can get you on the screen savers that episode as well.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.760]   And you can show me how to wire things. Yeah, yeah, I can bring mine in. I can bring mine in and we
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:05.720]   can kind of go over it. And here's the finished version and we'll kind of wire yours up and see
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.560]   if we can get it to work. It'd be fun. I'm jealous that you're able to find this time to do this stuff.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.280]   Well, you know, the other thing is my kids are a little older now. Yeah, so 10 to 16. So they're
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:19.080]   pretty self-sufficient. We don't have to change the diapers, wipe the butts, all that fun stuff
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:25.400]   like you guys are in the middle of right now. So it does help having the older kids. Yeah, it's true.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:34.200]   It's true. Hopefully not, hopefully soon not that anymore. Yes, yes. But yes, that's reality for me
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:41.320]   right now. And I definitely for Gina, I would imagine as well. Yep. Let's see here. Got a lot.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.920]   Here I thought there was not enough news to talk about. It turns out we're probably not going to
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:50.440]   have enough time to talk about everything. But I think this is interesting or maybe expected.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:57.480]   Amazon has sold out of its supply of the Fire Phone. The product page on Amazon now states,
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:03.240]   we don't know when or if this item will be back in stock. And an Amazon spokeswoman told Geekwire
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:10.280]   that inventory is officially depleted as of the end of August. So the Fire Phone, no more stock.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:15.080]   If you were thinking about picking up the Fire Phone, you might be out of luck unless you find a
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:20.280]   resaler on eBay or something like that. This coupled with Wall Street Journal's report that
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:26.760]   Amazon laid off dozens of Fire Phone engineers, I don't know, could spell the death of the
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:32.040]   Fire Phone experiment? Or maybe they're going to come back with a new and improved one that doesn't
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:38.520]   quite hinge so much on the gimmicks? I guess Amazon reportedly sold a total of around 12,960
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:47.240]   Fire phones. Wow, that's 13,000. That's teensy. It's miniscule.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.680]   But we understand why. I mean, really. I mean, just the marketing that went behind. I mean,
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.040]   think about how many people saw the ad for the Fire Phone. I mean, I don't mean to be like
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.120]   Sean Ford, but it is kind of nice to be like, "Oh, okay. Even Amazon, which is an amazing company
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:07.320]   that does amazing things, can have just a huge flop." Oh, I know, right? And the numbers that
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:14.200]   Amazon is used to moving on pretty much everything it says. And for this to literally be 12,000 and
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:21.880]   change devices, that's wow, that's a big thing. I wonder what the ratio of cardboard box tape
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:28.280]   to phone sold is. You know, because they were putting that the Fire Phone tape on everything.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:34.440]   How many yards of tape does it take to sell one phone? I feel like I still get the, I guess,
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:39.240]   it's not the phone anymore tape, but yeah, that tape. And we had to take a bite of Firefly, right?
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:44.840]   Was Firefly the feature? Firefly was a feature in the Fire Phone, but I believe you also,
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:50.760]   do you also get that in the Fire tablet? I can't remember. I think it's also in the Fire tablet,
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:54.360]   but yeah, that's a really good question. I'm trying to remember if it was part of the tablet.
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.000]   I thought that they included it there too. I thought it was just part of the US. Could be wrong.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.560]   Maybe we'll find out soon enough, because the Wall Street Journal also reported that Amazon
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:09.560]   is preparing to release a six inch tablet at around half the price of the Kindle Fire HD6
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.800]   targeting a $50 price point. $50 for a tablet.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.600]   $50 bucks.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:20.840]   Yet the Fire Phone came out at what? How much was the Fire Phone at launch? Was it 400? Was it like?
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.880]   No, I don't think so. I thought it was like $2.99.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.120]   I remember when it came out, everybody was like, wow, that is priced way high.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.400]   Fire Phone original price. I can't even remember at this point.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:42.280]   We're up to the rescue. $200 on contract. $650 off.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.960]   Fire Phone, $650 off contract.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:51.880]   Okay. Now they're coming out potentially with a $50 tablet. Maybe they are learning some lessons.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:57.480]   Well, the $50 tablet is the Kindle thing where it's like, this is actually you purchasing a buying
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:00.680]   machine like you. This is a machine that helps you buy things from Amazon.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.960]   And I guess they potentially don't have to clear anything with any mobile networks,
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:10.680]   mobile carriers, and all that kind of stuff, which I imagine is annoying and costly.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:18.680]   That's what we hear anyways. Let's see here. I know we've probably got more Google stuff to talk
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.040]   about. Did you guys, by the way, did you guys get the, do you run Amazon on your phones?
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:28.760]   Amazon app. Do you run the Amazon store app or any of that? Because I got the Amazon video app,
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.240]   which is a separate. Did you guys get that? Did you talk about that?
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.160]   I talked about it. Yeah. All about Android. Oh, you did. Okay. I don't want to.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:38.280]   But all about Android. This is a different show. Well, I'm just curious because,
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:42.760]   I haven't used it. I've been a little bit afraid to use it. Is it just basically being,
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:48.600]   is this ultimately the connection to prime instant video, training video, right?
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:52.840]   That they held off for so long. And one thing, one of the things that is added in here,
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.920]   and one of the things that Gina, you loved so much about it, you brought it into the arena on
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:03.400]   all about Android last week, is that it supports offline viewing. So you can download to your device
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:09.640]   and a streaming video, download that to your device. And then when you go flying somewhere,
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:13.080]   or whatever, you got it. Interesting. Yeah. I'm just going to point this up now. It's kind of,
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.800]   it's very Netflix-y. Yeah. It's Netflix-y. It's got that the X-ray feature where, like,
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.320]   if you're playing, if you're watching something, you can tap and I'll tell you, like, who the actors
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:26.760]   are and what song is playing, like the Google Play, similar to the Google Play feature,
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.360]   it's IMDB powered. Yeah, it's pretty good. I mean, it doesn't have a cast button. Like,
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:34.360]   that's my, that's the thing. That's a big one. Strange. That's the annoying thing.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:38.200]   I mean, really, if it had a cast button, man, I would totally use it.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.120]   Yeah. That's more than I would, you know. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.800]   More than I do now, which is hardly ever.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.800]   I just, there's tons of comments. Like, as a Prime member, there's just tons of content that I get
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:51.720]   for free that I just, you know, forget about. Don't look at. Yeah.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:57.320]   It's just kind of crazy. It's not like we don't consume content. Yeah. But Amazon has all this
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:02.360]   free, all this content that's tied into the price of our Prime membership, yet we forget about it.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:06.600]   And part of the reason for that is because up until recently, it's been very difficult as a
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:11.160]   general Android user and not an Amazon device, to actually gain access to that, which is just
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.040]   incredibly frustrating. Exactly. So I found that interesting. And I'm glad you guys talked about
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.920]   it. So I found that interesting that they're finally coming out with an app. I mean, you could
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:21.240]   get the app before, but it was, you could get it to work on non Amazon phones before, but it was
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.160]   extremely difficult. You had to install different things in different orders and trick it and get
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:30.120]   it to work. But I think maybe they're finally starting to get it. Like maybe they're following,
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:35.240]   they've been following Netflix queues and starting developing their own original content for a
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:39.880]   while now. So I mean, maybe they're finally realizing like, oh, yeah, we need eyeballs,
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.360]   actually, to actually make some money here. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:52.680]   Let's see here. Google is testing out its food delivery service. So kind of expanding
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:58.200]   their horizons here. Trials set for San Francisco and another unmentioned city at this point.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:05.960]   Google's partnering with Whole Foods as well as Costco. And yeah, food delivery. This would be
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:10.520]   an expansion of Google Express, which is kind of its current service that delivers merchandise,
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:18.520]   drive foods, drive, drive foods, if I can talk to customers. Competitors, of course, include Amazon
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:25.480]   with its Amazon fresh service and Instacart. And we'll also see an expansion of next day
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:31.800]   deliveries to a number of places in the Midwest for Google Express. So I would love to try this
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.360]   out, but it's not a pedal. I still have a coupon. I actually can get the service, I think, where I
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:41.000]   live. I've got a $10 coupon or something for what is it? What is the other service called Google
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.200]   Express Express. Yeah, I tried that Manhattan. Yeah, it was great. It was great. It worked. Yeah,
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:53.160]   worked. The stuff showed up. You know, it's funny. My like, my issue with this, like in my mind,
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.720]   in sort of an app driven world, you have to like be like, I want to do this thing. What is the app
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.920]   or the brand or the company that can do this thing for me? And so I have these very strong
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.400]   mappings in my mind, you know? So like, for me, like the Google mapping isn't delivery, right?
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:09.480]   Like for me, if I want something delivered, I'm going to go with seamless or Amazon, you know?
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.520]   And if I want the cloud, then I'm going to get Google, you know, if I'm going to watch streaming
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:15.320]   video, I'm going to go Netflix, which is part of the reason why I always forget about my prime
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:20.760]   instant video stuff, because to me, like, I'm on Amazon and go shopping. So while like, I'm sure
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:25.640]   that Google's entirely capable with their lots of money, you know, billions of dollars to create
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:31.160]   like a super fast and efficient delivery system, which would could possibly rival Amazon's,
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:35.080]   although it's hard to believe that Google, you know, is you can be anywhere near moving this type
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.640]   of merchandise at that scale that Amazon does anytime soon. I just don't think of Google. Like,
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:43.560]   I'm, you know, I just wouldn't think of Google to be like, Oh, let me let me order from Google
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:47.960]   versus Amazon. But that said, when they released a shopping express, it was a while ago, I feel
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.840]   like it was a while ago. And it was a day we were doing twig and I was I happened to be working in
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.200]   Manhattan because it hadn't been released in Brooklyn yet. And I ordered like, you know,
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.640]   some granola bars and snacks for the office and it showed right up and it was great.
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.800]   It was really and they gave a coupon. You know, they want they want new customers.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.200]   It's just that I just don't I just don't think like, Oh, Google, like, now I want produce from
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:10.600]   Whole Foods. So Google will deliver it to me. And I need to go grocery shopping log into Google.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.040]   Yeah, that doesn't really cross my mind. But because we haven't done that.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.040]   Cost goes a good partner for this, I think. Yeah.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:22.520]   Like a lot of the Costco stuff. We shop at Costco quite a bit, not as much for the bulk part of it
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:27.000]   as for the taste of some of the food items they have. They have some pretty tasty stuff. So I
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.040]   enjoy going to Costco. You do? Well, no. Okay.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.640]   You didn't sign the card because they actually have cards big enough for you to ride in.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:38.040]   I enjoy parts of going to Costco. Some parts actually really hate like the other parts,
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.680]   like the free food that they hand out. Oh, yeah. That's the car.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.120]   The carts craft me out. You can come and deliver me samples and then right, right.
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.760]   We like, I'll take three of those. Yeah. To me, it's just the cards. I can't I can't stop laughing.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.280]   Every time you go in there, if you just step back and look, it makes everybody look like a really
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.600]   little kid because the handles are like up to here. Like people are trying to get their chin
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:03.320]   over the cart because it's so big. Oh, it is. It's awful. Because they know you're loading up.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.360]   Oh, yeah. If you're going, you're loading up. You're buying more toilet paper and one
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.600]   one that you've ever bought in your entire life. Definitely. That's where Costco sings.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:18.760]   New Google Play is hitting and of course being torn apart. And so we're seeing
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:26.280]   fingerprint sensor code built into it in in large numbers. So kind of confirming what we think we
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:32.360]   know anyways about the next Nexus devices having fingerprint sensor in there. I for one, I'm really
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:37.160]   looking forward to the day when I can use my fingerprint authorization for things that I
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:42.920]   normally have to enter passwords into. Last pass is one of them that worked awesome for me when I
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:48.200]   was using the S six and it was just so nice to just go and have the password enter in. For some
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.640]   reason with the one plus two that doesn't work yet. And I'm sure it's a compatibility issue that
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.760]   either last pass or well, it's probably on last pass aside, but it's not recognizing the
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:03.960]   the fingerprint reader as being an official mechanism for security with the app. But
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:09.320]   it's cool. Starting to see a little bit more of that fingerprint code entering into Google's
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:20.920]   Grandmaster plan relative to Grandmaster Flash. I'm happy I didn't miss this one. Okay, Google
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:27.880]   IO this year. We saw a focus at least partially on virtual reality cardboard and something that
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:33.560]   Google called Google Jump VR. That's basically their platform for VR video and stitching it
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:39.800]   all together. This is a whole complex thing. Showing off on stage was a Go Rig comprised of 16
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:45.080]   cameras that could film content for jump and stitch it all together seamlessly. The rig is
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:50.920]   called Odyssey. And now content creators can actually sign up for early access to the hardware.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.240]   It'll be available in limited quantities. And they are aiming this at professional partners
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:03.080]   that that isn't totally evident by the rigs cost of $15,000. Yeah, $15,000. That's
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:09.000]   16 Go Pros, which if you break that down to a retail per Go Pro, that's around $8,000. So I
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.480]   don't know where the rest of that money is made up. There's mounts for each camera, memory cards,
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:21.240]   pelican case, and the rig itself. Man, $15,000. But can you imagine how fun it would be?
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:27.880]   How long will it be before Leo gets one in here? I mean, part of me would say like $15,000 is a
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:35.000]   lot, but he did buy like a $9,000 camera lens. And yeah, yeah, I'm sure it'll be right quick.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   Yeah, I think it's happening pretty soon. That would be pretty cool. That's really cool.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:48.120]   Wow. It's capable of 2.7 K video at four by three. I imagine that four by three, I'm trying to
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.240]   trying to kind of figure out visually what that means. That's your viewable,
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:58.040]   hilarious, I suppose. That's one kind of downside to this rig is that you don't really get up and
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:01.720]   down. It's not a full spherical thing. Yeah, we got the
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:07.560]   because when you take a look at the rig, there is nothing pointing up. Right. Right. It's all just
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:13.160]   it's so it's basically like surround on a vertical sense. And horizontally, there's nothing up there,
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.080]   which is kind of a bummer when you're spending $15,000 on a rig to do this type of thing.
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.520]   Well, it's going to have some blind spot somewhere because you got to hang it mounted,
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.240]   put it on a pole. Yeah, there's to be some place where you have things attached to it.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.720]   Well, but they've been I mean, I think I saw this. I don't know if it was if it was the GoPro one,
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:37.960]   but there was one on Conan when he was at Comic Con, I think they had one in the audio or above his
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.200]   desk or something and you could like tune in and put on your VR glasses and look around while the
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:48.520]   show was being filmed. It was kind of cool. That's fun. Yeah. Yeah. The blurriness up top though is
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:53.480]   a little bit of a bummer. You're like, Oh, yeah, it is. But I'm being super picky. Yeah.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.400]   It makes it seem like everything's foggy. Yeah. Like everything is foggy.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.720]   Yeah, foggy. It's foggy. It's a fog looming over you at all time.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:05.240]   This is the one that they showed at I wasn't that like a six bar.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.360]   There's glasses again.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.400]   Sorry, you're making us deal with it, Brian.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:17.320]   Yes. Sorry. I didn't have a perfectly position that do you what it is.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:20.760]   Why do we have to be the ones to deal with it, Brian? Why can't you deal with it?
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.200]   Because GoPro is awesome. So what I was super awesome.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.880]   You do revel in the GoPro. Did they have a six camera one though that they demoed?
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.520]   I thought they had the spherical. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:38.600]   Yeah. We're going to do, you know, whatever. Yeah. Go for a physical video solution. It does
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:44.280]   have six cameras. So they have that. I imagine it's a lot less than $15,000.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:50.200]   But I love this. What I wonder is how long it's going to be before they figure out how to make
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:55.720]   that and also 3D. Yeah. So, you know, and not just a flat image that surrounds you, but
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:01.080]   and technologically, that seems really difficult. Yeah. To be shooting everything in 3D and all
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:04.520]   directions and have it seamlessly stitch and everything. I don't know how you do that.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:07.720]   But thankfully, that's not my job to figure out. So there we go.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:12.600]   Did I miss anything? Anything you guys want to take, talk about real quick before I go to a break
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:17.080]   and then we do our tips and all that stuff? Anything that's burning in your minds?
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:24.760]   I think you hit everything, Jason, that there wasn't anything at Lollipop at 21%. That's kind of
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:32.120]   fun. Yeah. 21%. That's a nice, nice little milestone one year later. Yeah. Almost a year later. Wow.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:37.480]   It's just the way it is. That's just the way Android is. We just got it. We just got to deal with
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:43.240]   it. Yeah. Takes time. There we go. Thank you. I was waiting for that deal with it.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:50.280]   I think we have our title. Okay. If that's about it, then let's take a minute and thank our
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:53.960]   final sponsor. And then we'll come back and we'll do a couple of tips and we'll wrap things up.

[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:32.200]   person to talk about that sort of thing. Just very, very cool stuff. I've learned a ton about,
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:37.880]   you know, well, maybe I'm not a master of Adobe Premiere, but using it when we switch from final
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:43.400]   cut to Adobe Premiere, it really helped me with the transition. I've studied up on Pro Tools 11,
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:50.040]   soundproofing my audio space at home. If you can't tell by now, there are literally

[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:25.640]   watch to the finish. But you can also kind of consume them in little bite-sized pieces because
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:29.800]   they're broke up, they're broken up into kind of chapters and sub-chapters and all that kind of
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:34.280]   stuff. So it makes it easy to pick up where you left off. It's also transcripts included for all

[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:48.600]   Twit Network. Such good content there. I love it. All right. So we're kind of wrapping things up.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:53.560]   This is about the point in this week in Google where we talk to you guys and see what you got.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:57.400]   You know, tips, numbers, tools, whatever you happen to have. Gee, let's start with you. What did you
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:03.640]   got? My tip this week is this fun new Google search that does something kind of clever. If you
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:09.720]   search for the phrase "I'm feeling curious" or you search for the phrase "fun facts", Google search
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:16.840]   will return just a random bit of trivia. And it's completely, it's got the whole new logo thing. So
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:21.560]   when you ask the question, you get the little, you know, jumping dots, and then it shows a
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:25.320]   question and a answer. Like, how many miles are in a light year? And then it tells you what the
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:30.440]   answer is. And it's really fun and totally completely random. It looks like a lot of the trivia
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:35.160]   comes from different sources, Wikipedia and various places all over the web. And it's just,
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.080]   it's really a lot of fun. If you're playing a trivia game or you just, you know, kind of wanted to
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:43.640]   learn something new, and once you do it, you can tap the ask another question page,
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:49.240]   button, which is right below it. And you'll, you'll get a whole nother random, random fact. So
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:53.480]   I'm feeling curious and you'll, you'll, uh, learn something new at Google.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:57.480]   Yeah, it's really cool. Like you literally get something random out of nowhere and
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:01.000]   almost, almost every time you're like, oh, I didn't know that.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:01.480]   I didn't know that.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:04.120]   I don't know the answer to that question.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.000]   That's super cool.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.160]   Why don't you tell me making you smarter? So it was smallest country
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:15.640]   based on landmass, the Vatican city or Vatican city, a smallest country in the world,
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:19.560]   measuring just 0.2 square miles. How old was Wayne Gretzky when he retired?
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:24.840]   Somebody just yelled out the answer, I'm sure, but he retired at 38.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.840]   And good to know it before you did.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:32.040]   Was that USA today? Like you, if you look at the, at the sources, like you can see that it's not
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.280]   just Wikipedia or like trivia sites. It's like, you know, it's USA today.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.080]   The last one was from Leech Report. They're from different, there are definitely are a lot
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:42.520]   of answers from Wikipedia, but it's like, you know, faxed them all over the web.
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:46.840]   I feel like if Google opened this up in some way for developers to have access to this engine,
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:51.640]   they could make a really cool trivia app. Well, wasn't that, wasn't there a game like this
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:54.920]   from Google at one point? Wasn't there, oh, I don't know. Wasn't there a trivia game?
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.280]   I thought the Google should do that then.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.760]   Was there like a, it was like a scavenger hunt.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:03.400]   So you had to kind of use Google to find out. I'm also recalling something along these lines.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:08.200]   I thought it was you like you were supposed to use Google to find the answer like, and you're,
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.400]   it was like between you and another person and you trying to figure out who could do it faster.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.720]   Something in the back of my head is just telling me that this, there was a trivia game,
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:19.720]   but maybe the chat room will come up with it. I could swear there already was one like this,
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:21.480]   but it's interesting.
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:25.080]   I feel like this is, I mean, this is kind of Google kind of turning inside out some of their
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:29.720]   knowledge graph stuff. The way that Google computers are now understanding objects and
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:34.200]   attributes and questions, right? I mean, like the reason why Google can answer questions is
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:39.160]   learning how to parse text like this. So I think it's interesting to, to run this and see the
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.240]   question that it presents. And then the answer, because you know that when someone Googles
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:48.680]   that question, that's the answer that they give. So, so it's kind of neat to get to kind of be like,
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.680]   just, yeah, show me something. Maybe this is a play on. I'm feeling lucky.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.120]   Yeah, maybe this is what they're using their quantum computer for.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:02.200]   Random trivia. Yes, exactly. Something we can all get behind.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:07.400]   Useless facts. Maybe not all useless, but do we really need to know it right now?
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:10.600]   I don't. How many gallons of water in Lake Superior, Jason?
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:16.280]   I don't know. But, man, it's going to keep me up at night. I wish there was a resource that I
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.560]   could turn to to learn the answer. Maybe if you say, I'm feeling curious enough, you'll get
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.760]   the correct answer. Yeah, right. Yeah, I couldn't possibly just enter in the series.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:27.480]   I have to find you got to use the I'm feeling curious.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.720]   How long does it take you to get to this question? Exactly.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:33.960]   Aaron, it's well, it says Aaron's number in here, but you don't have to pick a number.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.880]   You can just you can go about another project. Okay. Are you saying I think that's your project?
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:41.160]   So we got the first one in. Now we've got another project. So I'm going to open up the
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:46.520]   magic Radio Shack bag now. This should be a segment. The magic with you. Aaron's magic Radio Shack bag.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.600]   Really? Here it is here, the lovely Radio Shack bag that I brought in. What could it be?
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:56.600]   What could it be? It really is a Radio Shack bag. So this is actually, again, going back to
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:02.360]   reusing things and doing things on the cheap. There was a time when I needed to trace out,
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.120]   we got a new house here in California and I needed to trace out the cables
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:10.760]   in the house because they were all mixed up. I didn't know how to do it. And I didn't have a
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.800]   cable tracer back when I was a business telephone installer, random piece of trivia there.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:22.520]   I used to have a nice little toner tracer and I could put a tone on a line on a cable and I could
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.600]   go to the other end where there's like 15 cables coming out and I could touch each one of them
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.240]   and eventually I'd find out the other end of that cable. But long since I've lost that tool,
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.120]   didn't have that tool. And so partially based on inspiration from an instructable, I found this
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.680]   cool little hack you can do. You can go to the dollar store, pretty much any dollar store,
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:46.120]   and you find these little white boxes that you attach to your window and there's a little magnet
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:50.920]   that you put on it. And a present sensor. Yes. And so if someone was breaking into your house or
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:55.080]   they opened the window and you didn't want them to, you can set it to go off. They have these for
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:58.600]   a dollar. Yeah, they're in the dollar store. Absolutely. Little bits of electronics. You can
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:02.040]   see them on the inside. I cut this part out and I'll tell you why in a minute. But this is where
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:07.560]   the speaker was. And you can hack that and what you can do, what I've done basically is I've
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:15.400]   separated the speaker that was in there from the board. And now what I can do, and I've attached
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:19.560]   these leads and a little phone jack because that's handy. You're not going to shock me. I'm not going
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:26.040]   to shock you. So now what you can do is you can actually, if I have this plug now, oh, the other
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:32.120]   hack I did to this was I kept running out of batteries. So I put a USB cable on here to replace
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.280]   the battery. So now I can take it just about anywhere, plug it into any USB jack. Let's see if
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.280]   this disrupts all of the of the mics in the studio. No, I don't hear anything.
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:50.200]   Was that me? No, that was me. Oh, man, you got me good. I was like, holy crap. I totally didn't mean
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:55.160]   to do that. I was okay. That was it. I was impressed. I was waiting for you. That was really
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:01.560]   impressive. That was a big quick on the drop. I've also got a dream back sound effect if you
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:08.760]   when you put it away. Wow. That was fantastic. Anyway, so I'm just so impressed by that.
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:15.080]   Of course, now it's not working. Oh, yeah, I must have done something. It's been sitting in my bag
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.280]   for a while. But anyway, you can go hack this thing. All it is, all you're doing really is
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:23.480]   extending the speaker from the device. So you go hook this up to your cable either by using the
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:27.400]   little alligator clips, or if it's a telephone jack, you go hook it up with the little telephone
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:31.560]   cord that I've soldered on to the to the end where the speaker used to attach to. Then you take the
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.640]   speaker back to wherever your cables are and you just go through and touch the different pairs of
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:40.920]   cables on the other end. And eventually the little speaker will go, little sine wave thing.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:45.080]   And then you know, you found the cable that you're looking for, the other end of the cable that
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.920]   you're looking for, and you can do whatever you were doing with it. So it's a really simple little
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:52.600]   one dollar hack. Of course, you know, if you have a soldering iron, that's always helpful. You
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:56.280]   can attach the cables, but you really don't need much. And you can make this thing work for you.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.560]   And you don't have to go out. If you buy those toner tester things, I think they're like 60,
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:04.440]   70 bucks for the for a set of them. You can find them cheaper at flea markets and things. But,
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:09.240]   you know, why do that when you can for a dollar, you can go out and hack together this nice little
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:15.160]   toner tracer. A word of caution, you may end up, if you have sensitive electronics on those lines,
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:20.440]   you know, if you're if you're not sure if both ends are disconnected, just be careful. Because
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.360]   this sends out a sine wave, you know, it could do some damage to sensitive electronics. But mostly
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:27.480]   electronics in your house, it shouldn't disrupt them at all. It should be fine. You're not going
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:31.560]   to blow up a phone or anything like that. That's connected to this. So there you go. That's my
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:37.320]   second project for the week. One dollar, I'm slightly scared of it. One dollar toner for tracing
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:43.400]   cables in your house. Interesting. Yeah. Great. I wish I heard it. I know. I'll work on it.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:47.480]   I'll tell you what, I'll work on this while you guys are doing your numbers. You're doing a number
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:52.920]   of tip and it's actually kind of kind of an old tip. But I think it's really cool. I've been
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:59.640]   having a good time with it. I think it's awesome. So if you didn't know, Google Maps app for Android
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:03.160]   is like one of the best apps in the world. I've always I've said that for years. It's one of my
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:07.640]   favorites. I use it all the time. It's probably one of my most used apps from navigation to doing
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:13.240]   all sorts of things. And they've been slowly bringing it up to material design. And they recently
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:17.160]   changed logo. They're always changing it and tweaking it and everything. One of my favorite
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:23.400]   features in the Maps app as of late is my timeline. And I don't know if you guys have seen this.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:28.920]   I'm going to go ahead and show this. It's kind of far away. And I'm not going to go into certain
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:33.960]   screens because it'll show my address. But basically what it does, if you have your location sharing
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:39.000]   set on your phone and you just live your normal life, what it will do is it will
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:45.400]   it will show you just how much how where you travel. It basically tracks your every move.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:50.760]   And it syncs up stuff that you do on the phone to those locations. So we went camping this weekend.
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:56.680]   So you can see I started my day out in Mendocino, California. I took a couple of pictures while
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:02.840]   we were by the campfire. Took a bunch of them actually. And then a little bit later we went
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:09.160]   into Mendocino, went to Frankie's, went out of this world shopping, went to the beach. I was on
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:14.840]   the beach with my kids and all this kind of stuff. Then we saw the sunset and everything. So that's
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:20.280]   day one. Then you can try switch over and you'll see little indicators too. That's a little tree
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:26.040]   because it recognizes that I was in Hennywood State Park. That we were driving, we passed through
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:31.400]   Navarro. We went to Navarro Winery actually and then went back to Hennywood. And it's just a cool
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:37.880]   way to kind of visualize what you have done over the course of however many days, weeks, years,
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:42.120]   because all this information, if you've had locations sharing on all this information,
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:47.000]   I mean, it's a little frightening. You realize that Google is storing all this information for
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:52.120]   you, but you also, you have access to it and you can kind of reap the benefits. It might actually be
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:57.640]   and it has been very beneficial to me. I just got rid of it and I'm going to be careful here
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:02.760]   because I don't want to show my address. It might be beneficial to you at some point. There we go.
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:07.800]   To need to navigate back to a particular place. And the only way that you can remember to do that
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:13.560]   is, "Oh, well, I know I went there two days ago. You may not have even actively navigated there."
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:17.640]   So you normally, you can maybe look at that and be like, "Well, I went there two days ago,
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:21.320]   so it's in my history." It actually is in your history whether you did that or not. It's in your
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:26.840]   location history and you can just go right into it and navigate me to Hendywood State Park.
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:32.440]   And it's the easiest thing in the world. So it's just kind of a way of looking into your history of
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:39.640]   travel and within the Google Maps app and be able to put it to use. Get yourself back to where you've
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:45.320]   been. Find out kind of what the last couple of days were like from a travel standpoint as well
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.560]   as from all the pictures that you took and having it all sink in on a timeline. It's literally a
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:56.680]   timeline. It's just awesome. Loving it. It's a good time. I didn't know about this and it's crazy.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:01.000]   It's so good. It's like I was on the subway. I was home and then I got on the subway and then I was
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.720]   at the DMV and then I went out for lunch. It's crazy how accurate it is. It'll tell you whether
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:10.040]   you're walking or driving. Exactly. Because... Oh, it knows I was on the subway. I guess it knows
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:15.240]   where the subway station is and where I lost a signal. That's... I mean, this is crazy. I had no
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:20.760]   idea. It's kind of a window into just what Google knows about you based on just you using your phone.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:25.800]   Yeah. Yeah. This is really neat. Thank you for pointing it out. Yeah. And the fact that we carry
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:30.840]   our phones everywhere. So all of this information, you know, is obviously very valuable to Google to
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:36.120]   know all this and at least you have access to it too. I guess that takes maybe a little bit of the
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:40.520]   creep factor away from it. But I don't know. I kind of knew that Google had all this information
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:45.800]   anyways. Yeah, you were good with it. You were down anyway. So it was nice. Yeah. It's awesome.
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:51.480]   It's awesome scanning through it though. It is. It really is. I'm like totally blown away. Yeah.
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:55.320]   And it goes back far. You'll keep scanning back and you'll be like, wow, okay, this has been going on
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:03.560]   for a really long time. Deal with it. Yeah. All right. Oh, where you? No. Okay. So, yeah, you know.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:08.440]   One out of two lane pad. I got one live demo today. That's okay. That's a good... That's actually
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:14.840]   really good. When you're pulling apart a piece of electronics from the dollar store, yes.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:20.920]   I think it's about time to wrap this up. We, you know, the whole schedule has kind of gone a
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.520]   little bit behind today because of the Apple event. But I think we've been able to pick up some
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:28.200]   steam and more importantly, we were able to cover, I think, most of the really important stuff that's
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:33.320]   happened this past week with Google and beyond. And I'm just thrilled that both of you guys were
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:39.640]   able to hop on and join me today. And Leo's absence. Thank you so much. Anytime. Yeah.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:43.640]   Gina, why don't we start with you first? What you working on? What are you most excited about?
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:48.280]   Where can people find you? Yeah. So my company ThinkUp is working on a new product. It's called
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:54.360]   Makerbase. That's a dot SE. It's a free website where you get to log on and you get to show everyone
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:59.160]   the stuff that you make, whether it's apps or hardware projects like like errands or
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:04.600]   little websites or software services. It's just kind of like a Wikipedia or an IMDB for digital
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:09.720]   projects or artwork. I'm really excited this weekend. I'm actually headed to Portland, Oregon for
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:15.880]   XOXO, which is kind of a meeting of a certain kind of kind of maker, big maker community. But
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:20.280]   so I hope you'll check out Makerbase. If you make stuff or if you're inspired by people who make
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:24.280]   stuff, I know I'm Aaron inspires me with his amazing hardware project. So I have added him
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:29.400]   to Makerbase. Awesome. You can add other people. Everybody's edits are visible. Everything is
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:33.560]   public. You get to describe what you did and how long you worked on things. We're kind of trying
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:40.200]   to make the CV or the resume for people who aren't really kind of like don't work in big corporations
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:44.040]   and whole titles. People who are proud of the stuff that they build maybe on the weekends or
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:48.520]   with friends or just kind of passion, passion projects. So I hope you check it out. That's
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:53.720]   makerbase.se. And yeah, that's all I got. Thank you again for having me, Jason. It was really fun to
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:59.720]   do Twig with you. Anytime. It's always my pleasure. And Brian, thanks for pulling up Anthony Nielsen
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:05.080]   creator of this week in Google's new logo on Makerbase because he is a creator. And that's
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:11.080]   what Makerbase is all about. Cool stuff. Aaron, what you working on? What you got? I'm going to go
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:16.440]   check out Makerbase. That is so cool. I'm like totally into it. Yeah, that's an awesome resource.
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:19.320]   I'm so excited. I forgot what I was going to say.
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:25.800]   So obviously you can follow me here on the Twig network. We mentioned earlier,
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:30.360]   do shows like Floss Weekly, all about Android, another good show that you might want to check
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:35.800]   out this week in Google and all kinds of other things. So definitely check me out on those shows.
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:43.080]   And I also am a president of a little place called Benisha makerspace, which is a lot of fun. So
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:49.400]   that's a place if you're not local to Northern California, San Francisco area, look in your
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.560]   local area nearby, see if you can find a makerspace or a hackerspace. Because it's a great way to
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:57.640]   get involved and just start learning essentially about things that maybe you're an expert in or
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:01.160]   there's new things going on or maybe it's something you just want to pick up. Some of the classes
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:06.760]   that are coming up at Benisha makerspace, for example, welding 101, something we're doing tonight
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:12.600]   actually, and we do that once a month, aquaponics. We're doing an aquaponics setup so that we can
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:17.480]   demonstrate what aquaponics is for people that are interested. Make your own bacon. That's right.
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:21.720]   You just not just about technology. It's about bacon. Everything's about better with bacon.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:27.720]   So we made our own bacon. And then Padre is going to come help us do a drone meetup. So we're going to
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:33.080]   do, we're going to talk about drones and he graciously volunteered to come up and talk about drones
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:36.600]   with people that people can bring their own drones or if you don't know anything about drones,
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.560]   you can just come and learn. He's going to let people fly him around. It's going to be a lot of
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:43.160]   fun. So he's making a special trip up to the makerspace to talk about drones. So
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:48.760]   anyway, if you're in the local area, we've already got a couple of Twitmans that have become members
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:52.680]   actually that found out about it through the Twit Network. So if you're in the local area and
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:57.080]   you want to join up with a great makerspace, come join us or find one in your own local area.
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:01.960]   Highly recommend it. Nice. Excellent. Always so much fun having you.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:07.160]   Yeah, definitely. Brian, normally I throw to you at the end of all about Android, but
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:12.280]   right on this week in Google. So yeah, I'm having flashbacks to last night. It's just like a different
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:17.880]   color scheme or something. Yeah, exactly. Well, so Aaron mentioned Padre. I do a show with him on
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:23.640]   Thursdays. Like he said, a lot of it is quadcopters, which are pretty awesome, but we do a bunch of
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:29.480]   other how to stuff. So check that out on Thursdays. And if you go to about.me/briambranette, you can
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:35.080]   find all the other places that I'm at on the internet. And deal with it.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:41.880]   Yeah. Does it work with two pairs of glasses? As long as the front glass is bigger than the
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:47.080]   back glass, but that worked. Wow. That works almost a little too well.
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:52.920]   You can find me about.me/jsonhowell. I also do other shows on the Twit Network, all about
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:39:00.040]   android, Twit.tv/aa. Also do Android App Arena every Wednesday, featuring four-ish
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:06.200]   android apps that I think are Nido. And that's Twit.tv/arena. And then if you want to listen to music
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:10.280]   that I've made, you can. It's yellowgoldmusic.com. I haven't made any in a really long time. I need
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:15.320]   to do that again. But that is it. It's always so much fun hosting this week in Google. And I just
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:20.040]   want to give a big thanks to Leo for letting me fill in while he's out because I just have a blast
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:25.400]   doing this. This week in Google records every Wednesday, around 1 p.m. Pacific, maybe a little
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:31.960]   later than that. But it depends on the schedule. 4 p.m. Eastern, 8 p.m. UTC. And you can always find
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:40.200]   pre-recorded or past recorded episodes at the site. And that's Twit.tv/twig. Thank you so much
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.440]   for watching this week. We'll see you next week. Leo, we'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:51.960]   Bye, guys.
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:54.540]   (upbeat music)
