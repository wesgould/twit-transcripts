[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Stacey has the week off, but Kevin Marks joins Jeff Jarvis and me.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.040]   We're gonna really talk about the fate of the world on this week's Google. We'll get a little philosophical.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.880]   Of course, is Google too rich, too powerful to even consider being not evil?
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.360]   Facebook too. Mark Zuckerberg's plan for world domination and a whole lot more. It's all on the table for this week in Google next.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.360]   Netcast you love from people you trust.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.360]   This is Twig.

[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.360]   and the mind of Jeff Jarvis, Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.360]   and author of what would Google do in private public parts and, I don't know, sorts of stuff.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.360]   Buzzmachine.com. Great to see you, Jeff.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.360]   - Hey, always good to see you. - Yeah.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.360]   Stacey has the week off, but we have the multi-talented York Sherman, Kevin Marks,
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.360]   - Andy Whittaker. - Dr. Yorkshire, I suppose.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.360]   Where are you? You're in Somerset. Where are you? I don't remember where you're from.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.360]   No, no, I'm in Yorkshire. - You're on Yorkshire.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.360]   - Call me. Yorkshireman is pushing in at all. My wife's from here.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.360]   I don't see, I can't see Yorkshireman quite yet. I've only been here six months.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   - Really? Or do you have to really be sixth generation to be at Yorkshireman?
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.360]   - No, no, you can. All right, I guess you can adopt it.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.360]   - I love Yorkshire people. I watched all creatures great and smalls in Yorkshire, isn't it?
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.360]   - It is. - Yeah, I just love that. Mm, I love that.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   - Oh, yeah, it's beautiful. - Yeah, beautiful country and a kind of a flammatic people.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.360]   They're like, people from Maine around here, kind of like that, just kind of, yep.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.360]   [laughs]
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.360]   We have so much to talk about. Let's start with the story that is just now breaking from the Washington Post.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.360]   Facebook says, "Oh, turns out we sold political ads to a shady Russian company during the election."
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:06.360]   They told congressional investigators today they discovered this to a company seeking to target U.S. voters
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   company in a Russian troll farm with sales of $100,000 of ads with a history of pushing pro-Kremlin propaganda.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.360]   They directly named Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   - Oh, but they did. - Most of the ads focused on pumping politically divisive issues such as gun rights
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.360]   and immigration fears, gay rights, racial discrimination. Wow.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.360]   - Yeah. - But Facebook. - Oh, but that's not all.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.360]   - Is it Facebook's job to block that kind of thing? I don't...
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   - I would report it. - I would report it. Yeah.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.360]   - The question is, was it called over their attention and did they not do anything? But here's the problem.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.360]   I guess I'd not take it back. I'd take it back. How would it... If you saw the ad, how would you know it's a Russian ad?
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   - Yeah. - We saw all this crap come across.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.360]   So the question is, how does Facebook in the end know that it's a Russian company and how could they have known and how will they know in the future?
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.360]   We certainly saw that there was tons of Russian manipulation in the election.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.360]   On this show before I've quoted the NATO handbook of Russian Information Warfare, and it's a script for what we're going through.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.360]   And so, yes, I think they have a responsibility to know so they stop it. The question is, how do you know?
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   - It is illegal for foreign nations to interfere in the US elections.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   - No, it's illegal for them to contribute. - To contribute, but it's not illegal for them.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.360]   We have a First Amendment here. - They could buy ads.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   - The former wants to come over and say something about our election.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.360]   - They could do that. - First Amendment applies to anybody. You don't have to be American to get protected by it.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   - Yes. - Okay.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.360]   - So this isn't illegal. - This isn't illegal. It's just helping the scumballs.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.360]   Does Facebook have a higher obligation than US law to prevent this?
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:05.360]   - Yeah, certainly it does. The same way that, if you're a news, again, I'm not trying to call the media,
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.360]   but if you're another medium that takes advertising, so if the Kremlin came along and wanted to buy an ad on CBS,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.360]   attacking Hillary Clinton on behalf of Donald Trump, should CBS take the ad?
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.360]   - It's not just in politics, too. These ads can be used to spread misinformation.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.360]   They're the Internet Research Agency, which is this troll farm in St. Petersburg.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.360]   Nice name, the Internet Research Agency, also apparently in 2013,
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.360]   by the way, 600 people employed across Russia. So it's a big troll farm.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.360]   I'm sorry, 2015, New York Times Magazine reported that the Internet Research Agency had launched social media campaigns in the US,
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:06:01.360]   including a sophisticated hoax that spread false news of a chemical leak in Louisiana in 2014, apparently to sow chaos and fear.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.360]   So because, you know, I feel like there's not much we can do about this because the Internet has made us,
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   this is the price we pay for being an open nation, and having an open Internet, right?
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.360]   - Well, I mean, there's back and forth on that. I mean, the UK is a fairly open nation, but we've banned political advertising here,
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   and police it fairly closely. So there's...
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:30.360]   - But what about this disinformation campaign, which is not political advertising, but merely an attempt to sow chaos?
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   - That's tough. It's tough. - Which is the goal.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.360]   - Yeah, I mean... - That's the goal.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.360]   - Yeah, yeah. - The standard point points out is polarization is the goal.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   - Right. - Attack on institutions is the goal.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:50.360]   - A weak West is good for Putin. - Right. And so we play along in media when we end up repeating their agendas.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.360]   Even when we debunk them, even when we fact check them, we help them.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.360]   - Can we ask Facebook to do something that the US law does not ask them to do? In other words, to block these things?
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:06.360]   - Sure. We asked them to not put up sleazy porn ads. We asked them not to put up sleazy drug ads.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   Google's taken down, you know, junkie drug ads. Yeah, I wish every media company would get rid of the likes of Rev Content and such.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   There's a lot of sleazy junkie ads out there. So, yeah, I think we can expect them to have quality.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   - That's... So, you know, I've done some work with a storeful and moat at the News Integrity Initiative at CUNY.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:40.360]   And again, full disclosure, folks know that it is funded in great measure by Facebook, but I have independence of Facebook.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   So we've started identifying the worst of the worst lowest rotten, hanging fruit of fake news sites, you know, outright lies.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.360]   I don't have the numbers now yet, but we'll put them out as soon as we have them.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:04.360]   But some surprising proportion of ad revenue that at least one company sees passing by its sites from major companies goes to these bad sites.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.360]   You have Sleeping Giants telling companies to get off Bright part.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:16.360]   Yeah, I think there is at least a public and consumer expectation now to behave and not to support crap.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   - And there's no question that these social media campaigns and advertising campaigns are successful can work.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   They're powerful. - Oh, yes.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   - That's one of the things we've learned about Facebook is how powerful advertising is on Facebook.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.360]   Here's another story. This is Dan Gooden writing in Ars Technica.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   A hacking group, "Dragonfly", has been attacking US and European energy companies since at least 2011,
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   establishing beachheads in the electrical grid.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   Eric Chen, who is technical director of Semantic Security Response to Technology Division said,
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   "What's most concerning is we now see them intruding on operational networks of energy companies."
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:06.360]   They actually, before we were talking about them being one step away, what we see now is they're potentially in those networks,
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   zero steps away from flipping the switch. There are no more technical hurdles for them to jump over.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   At minimum, attackers who have control of a company's operational network could use it to become de facto operators of the company's energy assets.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   That control includes the ability to turn on or off breakers inside the company's infrastructure,
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   hijack systems that monitor the health of the grid.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:37.360]   In other words, this looks like a concerted effort to undermine our grid.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.360]   We saw it happen in Ukraine. Ukraine is considered to be the testbed for Russia's hacking.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:49.360]   This is again why I recommend the NATO Handbook on Russian Information Warfare because it goes through exactly what was done
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   and it's meant to turn us against each other. It's meant to turn us against the truth to doubt the existence of truth.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   It's meant to turn us against the institutions and divide us from each other as communities.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:09.360]   They turned off the power in Kiev, just outside Kiev, about 225,000 people lost power for six hours.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   The power went back on, but it was considered an effective test by one of these nation-states.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   Probably Russia. It's hard to know.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:31.360]   Manual attacks, according to Symantec, are more difficult in the US than the Ukraine based on sheer size in order to cause an effect,
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.360]   something or someone would need to flip the switch to deploy a crash device, et cetera.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.360]   But we don't believe there are any technical hurdles in doing so.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.360]   So, there's some good news.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   We should also point out that this last week, I don't know if we reported it on this show,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:59.360]   but the seven members of the 32 member, or is 24 member, let me look and see and get the number,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   a technical advisory committee to the president resigned saying,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.360]   "Nobody's paying any attention to this stuff."
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   Those were, however, the hangover point is from the Obama administration.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.360]   Insufficient attention to threats. So, it could have been purely political.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   The rest remain.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   It's a 27 member council, seven resigned.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   Yeah, might not be.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.360]   Anything, although when you tie all these stories together, it's a little concerning.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.360]   I hope we aren't paying attention to this stuff.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.360]   Okay, let's just start with the bad news.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.360]   What was the story that I love today?
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.360]   The other hand, Oreo is out, so, okay, good.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   So, here's a story that fascinated me today. Can I jump to one?
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   What do you have to say about it?
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   That Facebook is ready to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for music rights.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.360]   If I interpret this right, so, on one hand, this seems to be, we don't know how to keep your music
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.360]   from being pirate, and so, we'll just pay you and go away.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.360]   But on the other hand, this enables users to then use music in their videos.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.360]   I think that's more power.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.360]   That's more the point.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   Right? That's what it is.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   I wasn't misinterpreting it.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.360]   That's amazing.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   That Facebook would enable its users to be, they might as well buy a stock photo agency
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   too for memes, and you can make content here and make it freely, and it won't get taken
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   down for all these stupid reasons.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   Well, I think that's phenomenal.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.360]   A good template for this is Jiffy, right?
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   Jiffy makes these animated gifts that everybody now uses.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   They're animated.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.360]   I just got them in Gboard, the Google keyboard.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.360]   I can now pay animated gifts into my texts and so forth.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.520]   So, what's happened in the past, of course, is recording industries, and made that YouTube
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.760]   and Facebook pull down anything with copyrighted music.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.480]   Facebook's saying, well, well, forget that.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.360]   Why don't we just give you some money and people can use it?
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.800]   Well, that's what YouTube does as well.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   Right.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   YouTube does that.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   In fact, the...
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.240]   Well, yeah, YouTube does that, but YouTube doesn't allow you to use the music.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.240]   And users to use the music in their videos, this enables the user to use the video.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   It does.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240]   It does.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.240]   It does.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.880]   If you insert copyright music, it'll say this is copyright music, and depending on what
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.680]   the label has decided, they'll either they get the advertising revenue for it, or they
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.240]   get a buy link attached to it, or they make it...
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.080]   Right, but I think that's different.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.080]   Right.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.080]   Right.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.080]   Got it.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.080]   But I think this is different.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.080]   And maybe I'm wrong.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.080]   Maybe it's only an inch, not a foot.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:44.640]   But in that case, YouTube is either paying ad revenue to the music company because they
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.080]   left it up, or they take it down, or the user can buy it.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.080]   In this case, Facebook...
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.240]   I think what Facebook is just saying, "Oh, we'll buy it for everybody."
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:57.800]   Lucas Shaw and Sarah Fryer writing Bloomberg Technologies say that the music industry executives
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.840]   also hope licensing songs for user generated video on Facebook will place greater pressure
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.320]   on YouTube to behave.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.920]   But by further empowering Facebook to host video and music, rights holders risk creating
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:15.240]   another YouTube, a great source of promotion, but a place where consumption outpaces sales.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:23.400]   The good news is the music industry grew 5.9% in 2016.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.400]   What's the chart look like?
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.920]   I don't even know how much did it shrink before it started growing ago.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.840]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.440]   Well, it depends where you measure from.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.920]   Right.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:39.000]   So Universal Music Group, owner of the world's largest record label, reported a 15.5% increase
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.640]   in sales in the most recent quarter.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.040]   Warner Music Group, the second of the big three, said a 13% increase in sales.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.320]   So this is going to be an even better year.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.120]   So the good news is the music industry has found ways to make money, particularly from
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.120]   streaming services.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:00.200]   That's the real way to make money these days from Spotify, Apple Music, and so forth.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:06.040]   So in a second quarter earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg said, "For the next few years,
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.320]   video will drive our business and determine how well we perform."
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.720]   And we're going to continue to invest in the format.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.240]   This is an interesting story related.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.920]   Rights to James Bond are for sale.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:29.200]   And among the usual bidders for James Bond, Apple and Amazon.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.760]   So I guess the rights to James Bond are owned by MGM.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.640]   They've been trying to sell it off for a couple of years.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.600]   Sony, Universal, and Fox are pursuing it.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.480]   Warner's in Sony, the most aggressive.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:49.360]   But according to Hollywood Reporter, Apple, with its newly arrived executives from Sony
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.480]   Pictures Television, is in the running.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.440]   It's about, it's applicable to easily afford the franchise.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:04.320]   You two could buy the rights to James Bond for mere two to five billion dollars.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:10.200]   In the world of Lucasfilm, which of course is Star Wars and Marvel, Bond feels really
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:15.600]   underdeveloped, says someone familiar with the process.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.040]   I mean, look how well Star Wars has done.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   How well Star Wars has done around forever.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.560]   Yeah, but Star Wars has done so well for Disney.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.360]   They have turned that into a money machine.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.080]   There's going to be a movie every year.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.240]   Every movie makes almost enough money to pay off the purchase in the first place.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.120]   They've got the Disneyland Star Wars is under construction.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.560]   They're going to have a Star Wars hotel.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.000]   Marvel's been huge for Netflix.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   It's done so well.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.800]   And of course, the Marvel movies have made tons of money.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.480]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.760]   I mean, there's never been a, I mean, Bond movies have continued to be cranked out.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.000]   What were there 60 of them, right?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.920]   Well, they ran out of no bus long time, didn't they?
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.720]   Yeah, Daniel Craig.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:02.080]   Is apparently, despite his complaints about playing Bond back for another Bond outing at
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.640]   the end of next year.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:11.160]   No, it takes a long time to make these two years, November 8th, 2019.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.320]   They haven't started making it yet, I guess.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.080]   I know, you know, it'd be funny if Apple bought Bond.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.640]   I think Amazon, I'd be great.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:25.720]   Amazon's been underwriting some really good movies lately.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.560]   And I think there may be either Amazon or Apple would be more willing to take chances than
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.880]   traditional movie companies.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.040]   That's one of the things that I think Disney has done such a good job with Star Wars by
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.720]   taking some chances and winning Star Wars fans over.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.480]   The biggest, it was Force Friday, last Friday.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:49.000]   And I don't know how many R2 D2s and BB8s they sold, but a ton of them.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.840]   Everybody's talking about it for Christmas.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.240]   That'll be the Christmas gift, I'm sure.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.640]   The Sphero R2 D2s and the new BB8, the dark BB8.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.840]   Okay, all right.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.440]   So you see that with some happy news.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.080]   That was a little bit of a share to everybody up.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.080]   Kind of.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.080]   Kind.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.840]   We talked about it Sunday on Twitch.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.440]   I can't remember if we talked last week about the think tank.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.880]   Yeah, we did.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.960]   So there was a follow up that we didn't have, which was of course, Cashmere Hills article.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.720]   Which was very good.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.560]   Yeah, although you're the journalist, some experts.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.080]   So I'm curious what your take is on this.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.840]   Cashmere, of course, we love Cashmere Hill.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   She's great.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840]   She's a great reporter.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.480]   Doing special projects for Gizmodo.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.680]   She writes, yes, Google uses its power to quash ideas it doesn't like.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.920]   I know because it happened to me.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.200]   She's been telling this story apparently at bars for some time.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   She said that.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.200]   I didn't make that up.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.680]   It's been a good bar story for her.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:59.600]   But when she worked at Forbes, so this is, I don't think it's completely clear, Jeff,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.200]   but I want your take on this as a journalism professor as an ethics expert.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:11.040]   She was both a reporter for Forbes, but also managing social media and wearing her hat
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:17.960]   as the social media arm was invited to a meeting with Google, which was about to roll out
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.760]   its Google+ social network.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.680]   Google salespeople had made the other executive sign an NDA.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:32.760]   Apparently she did not know about that, did identify herself as a reporter, but was then
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:39.880]   told by the Google salespeople Forbes should add the plus one button to its site right next
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.720]   to the already Facebook like button and red share button.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.400]   They said, this is cashmere's writing.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.520]   It was important to do so because the plus recommendations would be a factor in search
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.800]   results, a crucial source of traffic to publishers.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.320]   This sounded like a news story to me.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.040]   Google's dominance in search and news give a tremendous power over publishers.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.200]   So she said, did I just hear correctly?
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.480]   If a publisher doesn't put a plus one button on the page, it's search results would suffer.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.080]   The salespeople said yes.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.360]   She did the right thing immediately afterwards.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.360]   She went to Google's public relations team as a reporter, not as a social media person,
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.560]   told them that she'd been in the meeting said, did I understand correctly?
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.360]   The press office said yes.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:27.440]   We prefer to say the plus button influences the ranking, but they didn't deny what their
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.640]   salespeople told me.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.800]   She says, if you don't feature the plus one button, your stories will be harder to find
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   with Google.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.120]   So she published a story, headlined stick Google+ buttons on your pages or your search traffic
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   suffers.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.440]   That is a big story.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.200]   Google complained saying that was an NDA meeting.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.760]   She can't write about that.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.480]   They asked her editors to take it down.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.080]   They went to her and said, take it down.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.920]   I'm not sure why, but I guess they had it.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   I don't know.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.920]   Anyway.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.400]   They had a very strange CMS in those days.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400]   She probably had to kill us.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.200]   I can't log in and take it down, but could you?
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.960]   She said, I thought it was an important story, but it didn't want to cause problems for my
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.040]   employer.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.440]   And if everybody was covered by an NDA, I can understand why Google would object.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.800]   She said, I had, because I had gone to the PR team and before publishing, it was already
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   out there, I felt it more sense to keep the story up.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.080]   But after continued pressure from my bosses, I took the piece down, a decision I will always
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.960]   regret.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:32.480]   Now this next piece, I think, doesn't prove anything, but she says then the cash results
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.520]   of the story were deleted and you couldn't find that story.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.560]   Google's crawler just didn't show that story.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.680]   She said that was a little suspicious to me.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.280]   She got an, actually I thought a very good letter from Google after she published the
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.360]   story in Gizmodo.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.200]   Their response was, I thought, well, written.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.560]   Well, I didn't see that.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.560]   Hi, Kashmir.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.560]   I want to clear the air on this.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.520]   We've always enjoyed working respectfully with you and are sad that you've carried this
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.520]   since 2011.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.280]   I'm sorry about how this went down.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.920]   I wanted to give you the TikTok from our end.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.280]   Let me tell you who's writing here.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.920]   So you can, it's Rob Shilkin, who's Vice President of Global Communications at Google.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:14.800]   From our perspective, this was in a disagreement over whether a meeting was held under an NDA.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.560]   Our sales team, well, I'll go on there.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.920]   You can read more about that.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.480]   I understand our PR rep asked the piece to come down from Forbes website as it was reporting
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.920]   on a confidential business meeting.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.040]   Your editor agreed.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.320]   He told our PR rep the article is being removed because it involved reporting on an NDA meeting.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:38.360]   As for the Google cache, and this is important, it's trivial for the website owner to request
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.440]   that the cache be cleared.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.520]   I assume this is what happened because we had nothing to do with removing the article
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.080]   from the cache.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.040]   We would never engage in this type of behavior.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.400]   I hope you understand that.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.520]   You've long held our and the tech industry's feet to the fire on privacy issues.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.680]   We've written more than a few critical stories about Google plus and many other things.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.800]   To my knowledge, never have we had any issues like this, even with the most critical story.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:08.480]   So, after reading this, Jeff, I feel like, well, it was an NDA meeting.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.240]   It wasn't her, the other great example of this.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.600]   She should have been told it was an NDA meeting.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:23.040]   So what was the, there was a case with the Guardian and the private confessions site that
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.040]   used to exist.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.360]   Oh, God, you remember what that was?
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.640]   Where people would go on anonymously and confess secret.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.280]   Yeah, it was a secret of like it.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.080]   And the most secret, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.080]   Was it no?
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.080]   I don't think it was post secret.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.320]   Anyway, but there was a promotional, there was a, there was a same thing happened.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.360]   A business meeting where journalists were part of it because journalists are now, the
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.040]   walls aren't clear.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.640]   So journalists are part of product.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.800]   Journalists can sit in the meeting with product with somebody else.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.520]   It's all mushed in now.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.240]   And the journalist knows something.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.360]   And so the Guardian said, our greater goal, our greater responsibility here is to the
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.760]   public.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.760]   And they reported that information was being, I wish I could have the details of the story.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.240]   I'm sure somebody in the chat room has it.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.240]   Information on users was not as private as they thought.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.640]   It was a mushy story in lots of ways.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:16.120]   At some level, I think that the journalist has to ask where her obligation lies first.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.480]   And I would say it lies first with the public.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.440]   And to be clear, she had not signed the NDA.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.920]   If she'd signed the NDA, this would be a different.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.760]   She called the people.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.960]   So what happens if, what happens if instead of me with Forbes, Google would have the same
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.160]   meeting with business week.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.600]   And over that drink that apparently Cashmere enjoys, and the Google also had the end of
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:47.280]   his letter, over that drink, the business person, business week says, Cashmere, you cover Google,
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.400]   I got to tell you what, boy, this thing just happened.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.440]   And that person may have violated NDA, but like a reporter, whether it's, whether it's
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.760]   snowed, nor anybody else, whether it's a matter, or it finds it out, the reporter's obligation
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.760]   is to free the information you have it sign the NDA or agreed this is off the record or
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.760]   because you, I'm sure Cashmere does honor it.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.520]   If somebody says this is off the record, she doesn't report that, right?
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.520]   Right.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.360]   So what's our goal of the public's interest is that Google, Google made a mistake and
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.000]   asking for it to be taken down back in the day.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.320]   Whether it's NDA or not, once it was out, it was out.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:28.120]   And for Google to be caught in the right to be forgotten problem, and Google to argue
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.440]   that we shouldn't be a racing history, for the Google to then go to a media company and
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.440]   try to erase history.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   Oh, sorry.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.360]   Don't say, don't say that you were too often.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.680]   That, I would say, Google's not listening.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   Oh, no.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.960]   Hey, you said it's not okay.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.520]   That was the problem.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.520]   Not okay, Google.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.520]   Okay.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.320]   So that's the one issue.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.280]   That's the one issue.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:58.640]   I suspect the other half of this is that it's the left hand note with the right hand
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.720]   is doing is I Google itself.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.960]   I'm fairly sure that my house would have been very, very grumpy about the sales people
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.040]   saying that about search ranking and corrupting the work that they were doing to keep the
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.040]   questions pure.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.640]   So that's the second question.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.360]   You can, we can go back and forth over Cashmere's obligations, the NDA and so forth.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:23.800]   But no one's denied the essential assertion of her article that if that the plus one helped
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.760]   your search rankings, you don't think that's true?
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.760]   Kevin?
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.840]   Well, yeah.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:37.360]   If I was being mapped, I'd say there are many thousands of factors that influence search
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.040]   rankings and we can't disclose it.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.800]   So probably the plus one does does have something for the search ranking.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   Sure.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.240]   That mean that they've been pinged and they'll more likely crawl into things like that.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:56.520]   If you want analogy, the current argument around this is AMP pages.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.080]   AMP pages influence your search ranking because if you have them, you show up in the carousel.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.080]   So they don't necessarily--
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.080]   It's clear.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.920]   --through it's your ranking, but they do influence your placement.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.880]   And so that's a tricky one for-- you know, Google is dancing around that at the moment.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:17.280]   And they're arguing it in both faith, in good faith, on both sides to some extent.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.840]   But from the media companies' point of view, a lot of the reason they're doing AMP is to
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.320]   improve their search ranking.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.200]   In practice, it's improving their search ranking because their page is actually loaded
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.400]   rather than just sit there and spin at you while junk downloads onto your phone.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:42.160]   But there is the reason that the carrot there is that they show up in the carousel.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:47.520]   And any of these, when you're a company that big, a carrot and a sticker is not that--
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.400]   It's a bit hard to distinguish them.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.400]   That's the challenge.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.080]   So let me go to the larger thing.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.920]   There's also a story I put on the rundown just now.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.800]   Josh Marshall from Talking Wet's Memo, who's a really wonderful entrepreneurial journalist,
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.160]   goes through a saga of how he has felt under the gun of Google.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.040]   He's just a small business owner.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.680]   So I started writing a post about all this.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.520]   And it was too big to write.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:15.560]   So I thought instead I would talk about it here.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.760]   I'm often in the position where I defend Silicon Valley and the platforms against those who
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.200]   presume bad, motive and bad behavior.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.560]   And I still do that and still believe that.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.280]   But-- and there are those who now argue that the platform is because they are too big in
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:37.640]   their view and because they control the internet should be regulated, which as you know, I fear.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:45.040]   But it is true in my mind that the platforms have a much higher obligation to virtue than
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.640]   even they have presented.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.960]   And so I was thinking about this.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.480]   I've defended Don't Be Evil because I knew where it came from.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.600]   It came from Paige and Bryn saying, keep us honest employees.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:02.000]   But there's a little bit of-- I want to say cynicism in there.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.600]   That's not going far enough.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.680]   That do good is what their goal should be.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.640]   And there are those who will say that it's impossible.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.720]   Companies will always put profit before everything else.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.520]   Companies can't do good.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.120]   But we've seen these days that doing evil has a much higher price than it used to because
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.440]   of exactly what we're doing right now.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.640]   Because we can talk about the companies, we can learn about them, we can spread this.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:30.680]   So I think that Silicon Valley and the companies are still far, far too much in the mode of
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.680]   thinking.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.880]   People understand that we do wonderful things.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.080]   They have to go out of their way.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.840]   Eric Schmidt should have said to New America, I'm going to disagree with this article, but
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.000]   don't you dare do anything about it.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.360]   Don't you dare get rid of this guy.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.560]   Don't do anything about it because we welcome different opinions.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.080]   And if we give you money, we expect that.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.280]   And that's what we want.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.280]   Google should have said, don't you ever kill a story?
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:59.320]   They need people inside these companies who think from an ethical framework at a very
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.320]   high level.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.480]   Otherwise, they're going to get zapped by the regulators.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.880]   They're going to get zapped by PRs.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.880]   It's bad business.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.000]   And they also have a higher responsibility because they control our internet.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.560]   What and by the way, in this discussion, replace Google with Facebook, you'd have much the
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.560]   same discussion.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.560]   Same exact discussion.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.440]   So last week, I criticized Facebook for having higher issues.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.200]   The person in charge of transparency who most journalists don't have a lot of respect.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:31.680]   So Josh's point is kind of that when you get as big and powerful as Google, the wielding
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:37.000]   of the power doesn't have to be heavy handed and obvious.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   It's just in the nature of things.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.040]   And I think it's true of Facebook.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:46.880]   The publishers rely on Google and Google wields great power with them.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:52.120]   And in that respect, say, I think with Facebook, publishers are at Google's mercy.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.640]   He says, this is actually a good analogy that might make people help people understand it.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:01.520]   He says, if you're a Star Trek fan, you'll understand this acknowledge.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.440]   It's a bit like being assimilated by the Borg.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:09.680]   You get cool new powers, but having been assimilated, if your implants were ever removed,
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.440]   you'd certainly die.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.640]   That basically captures our relationship to Google.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.360]   So it's not all bad for publishers.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:22.640]   In fact, it's so good for publishers as is Facebook that it's hard to turn your back
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.520]   on the candy.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:28.200]   So what they have to do is they have to have a higher level of standards.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.720]   They have to put out principles beyond just don't be evil.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:35.000]   Do they do that and say, I think to some extent, there's some statements, but I think
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.080]   what I'm saying is because they control our internet, because they are so big, because
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:42.680]   they are under watch, they've got to be better than any other company.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.760]   I've always kind of said this in a different way with it that Google should be like a
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.320]   priesthood.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.840]   One way to handle this is when you imbue somebody with this much power, you also have to instill
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.560]   in them.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:04.440]   It's a little bit of a mythos, but you instill in them this higher responsibility that this
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.880]   is a great, it's like a police officer.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:12.960]   You give them a gun, but you have to instill in them this sense of, this is for the greater
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.960]   good.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.560]   I'm committing my life to the greater good.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.720]   I would even give my life for the greater good.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.800]   Otherwise, the given them the gun could be a problem.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.840]   Well, that, I mean, that's it.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.600]   That is the point of don't be evil.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.840]   That was, that was the point there was to say, step back and think about this.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.840]   No, that's not enough.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   I'm not saying it's enough.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.840]   No, absolutely.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.840]   The other thing here is-
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.840]   That's why I say a priesthood.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.960]   You need to have rituals and robes and incense.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.960]   You need to have a Bible.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.960]   You got to go.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   Yeah, you need a Bible.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.560]   You need to instill this as a holy faith.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.560]   No, that could go back and backfire.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.200]   That could be wrong too.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.720]   Because then they get accused of being, you know, holier than now and we're perfect and
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.720]   we're wonderful.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.800]   No, you have to be more monks.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.960]   You have to be more supplicants.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.640]   You have to be humble.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.480]   You have to know that you're going to screw up.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.800]   You have to be held to principles that you set.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   This is not easy, but hey, you got all the benefits in the world.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.960]   The biggest brands and biggest companies and huge growth, you're controlling the damn
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.160]   internet.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.760]   We have to hold you to a higher standard.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.440]   You have to hold yourself to a higher standard.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.440]   Right.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.560]   So, okay, I want to talk about three things here.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:31.720]   One is that there's this soft power has a sort of secondary insidious thing, which is
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.200]   that it's not necessarily actually influenced.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.480]   It's just the idea that it might be is very chilling.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.920]   I'm fairly sure Schmidt didn't say, sack these guys, shut them up.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.840]   But did you say don't?
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.600]   But the emails were, you're not being collegiate.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.640]   You'll damage your pissed Google off.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.440]   And then the other part of our group won't get funding.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.000]   So stop talking out against Google.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.080]   So she was explicitly saying, do not speak against our major fund.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.080]   Right.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.080]   Probably.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.080]   I mean, that's what's insidious about it.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.560]   Why not even Google may have exerted zero pressure.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:10.160]   Schmidt may have never said anything.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.160]   He didn't have to.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   It was under his hands.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   They have to be conscious of that.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.160]   They have to be conscious of that.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   Oh, well, can they tell us?
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.160]   Yes.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:20.080]   So, you know, and I, again, this is so, this is so much on my mind because I took a lot
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:25.800]   of money from Facebook for the news integrity initiative and we negotiated independence.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.360]   And this is exactly why.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.800]   But I had to be very conscious.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.040]   I didn't write about the case of Facebook hiring the former New York Times public editor,
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.640]   Liz Bade, to be in charge of transparency and how I thought it was a bad hire.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.840]   Because it took me so long to figure out how to write it.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.760]   It was over by, you know, it was too late.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.440]   But would you agree that this is something journalists are constantly challenging themselves?
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.800]   A good journalist is constantly challenging themselves with am I biased here?
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.400]   Am I looking out for the good of my employer versus the good enough?
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:58.280]   And that's where I mean the police to it because a good reporter has to hold as her
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:03.840]   highest ethic that I'm here for the people, right?
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.240]   I'm here to speak truth to power.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:12.120]   I'm here to represent the people, not my employer, for instance.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.120]   Yes.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.640]   We do that sometimes to an obnoxious extent.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.040]   I mean, I don't think it may be obnoxious.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.040]   Who cares?
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.040]   It needs to be done.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:26.240]   I'm saying, no, no, what I'm saying is I've seen cases where report where let's say
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.240]   let me.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.080]   Well, no, I've seen cases where the business side of a newspaper will do a deal with a company
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.840]   and every reporter will back over themselves to not ever put that company and to try to
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.760]   expose all of that company because the business side didn't.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.520]   We deal with that all the time.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.240]   I tell our people, you know, you need to know who our sponsors are.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.240]   You need to disclaim it when you're doing a star on our sponsors.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.680]   And you can't give our sponsors favorite treatment.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.600]   But on the other hand, you can't be, it's very hard to do.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.920]   You can't be negative about them either.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:02.160]   If possible, put it out of your mind that they're a sponsor and report exactly as you
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.400]   would have if they weren't.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.240]   That is very hard to do.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.240]   And it gets in.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.440]   It gets really hard if you're not, this is a flat institution.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.440]   So advertising is right here.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:18.760]   There's no firewall between editorial and advertising in a podcast because we do the
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.480]   ads.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.320]   So it's a very challenging thing to do.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.440]   Nor is there in a product world in a news organization now where you're creating new
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.120]   products all the time.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:33.680]   And in that team, you have technology and marketing and sales and editorial and all
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.360]   and together, which is the way it should be.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.760]   So that's why the priesthood doesn't extend just to the journalists.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.280]   It extends to everybody in the company.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:46.840]   And part of, I think that people in media companies, every employee should be trained
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.120]   in the eternal verities of journalism and the cause of what they're doing and why they
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.120]   exist.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:58.720]   Similarly, on Google and Facebook and Twitter for God's sakes, all the platforms that stand
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:05.360]   in this powerful position, I think that they've got to do a lot more in thinking about their
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   moral authority and not to claim it.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.920]   They don't, but not to presume it.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.080]   They don't do that either, but to earn it and earn it every day and hold each other on
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.080]   us to that.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.440]   Same goes by the way, let me say for media.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:25.040]   And I think that we in media don't grapple enough with the fact that paywalls, red line
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.960]   journalism away from poor people, reach-based advertising brings us to clickbait, which doesn't
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.480]   just mean cats and Kardashians.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.880]   It also meant, watch out here, Donald Trump.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.640]   The conflicts that we have in media, the ways we're trying to save ourselves, the ways
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:45.840]   we're forgetting what our real mission is, we ain't pure, we ain't clean either.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:50.800]   I'm not holding us to any higher standard, I don't think, or lower standard, but we all
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.480]   have a larger societal responsibility.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.800]   Kevin, you wrote an article, a blog post, I really like this.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.880]   You posted a link to it in the chatroom, otherwise I would not have known about it because you
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.960]   wrote it 14 years ago in your blog, a PAS at Piggany, about morale.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.960]   Just show it off.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.960]   You know how to say that, Leo.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.960]   I don't, I'm making it up.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.800]   I don't know what it means.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.400]   I'm justifying exquisite equine entrepements.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.960]   But this is along those lines, isn't it?
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.160]   These are the kind of ethical standards.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:29.640]   No, this was, so this was, Jane Jacobs wrote this book a long time ago called Systems of
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.640]   Society.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.840]   I think it was, Systems of Survival.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:39.600]   That was it, which is about, there are two primary moralities, two sort of cultures.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.560]   There's the commercial culture and there's the Guardian culture.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:51.280]   The difference between them is that the commercial culture has a coherent ethos and the Guardian
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.520]   governmental priest who typed in, you're talking about it, has a coherent ethos, when
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.200]   you mix them it gets difficult.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:05.760]   There's a whole book about it, which is well worth reading if you want to pick that up.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:15.280]   This post was trying to say, "Oh, could we come up with a new one that's not commercial
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.400]   and is not Guardian, but is open source?"
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:23.560]   So it's trying to come up with these kinds of, trying to come up with a sort of open
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:27.720]   source, open web version of these ideals.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.480]   I'm not saying this is fully thought through, but it was very interesting to read this.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.800]   That is a challenge, you have to step back and think about these things, because her
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:42.280]   point, the underlying Jane Jayford's point is, is that the commercial thing is consistent
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:50.840]   in itself and it is designed to, you avoid force, you trade, use initiative, you're honest,
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:57.000]   you're optimistic, there's hope and you respect contracts and so on.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.640]   You compete and there's a sort of structure to that.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:08.080]   There's a coherence in the Guardian, the priesthood mode, which is you have a monopoly, you should
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:13.320]   not be trading, you work within the system.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.480]   There's a set of things you do if you're in that mode.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:23.080]   You respect the hierarchy and the tradition and your obedience and there's a coherent
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.960]   morality there, which can be used in circumstances too.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:34.520]   The challenge is if you get the mixed up, then you end up with a mafia or you end up with
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:40.000]   the kind of corruption that we're talking about with the Russian state or things like
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.480]   that.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:47.400]   The worry is that we're moving towards, we have moved towards that since you wrote this
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:53.640]   book in America and in the UK to something sent as well, where we have this, we've mixed
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:58.960]   this idea that the government and the commerce are running in separate spheres, they're now
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.560]   running these over whackings.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:08.360]   It's funny because I've been thinking about this a lot too because I feel like one of
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:14.960]   the reasons we're in a shaky times, I mean, you wrote this in 2003, and it was, God,
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.360]   that was a long time ago.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:25.000]   All those were the days where you had a merchant ethic and you had a mercenary ethic or a
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.720]   guardian ethic.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:32.840]   I love the desire to create an information ethic and all of these attributes.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:39.680]   These are all based on essentially based on a mythos that one has to buy into.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:45.320]   You need true believers because if you're a police officer, for instance, or a monk or
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:55.680]   a priest, you need to be a true believer in the tenets of that holy order in order to
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.320]   enforce that.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:02.240]   The problem is that I think we're living, not only we're living in a post-fact world,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.200]   we're living in a post-mythos world or maybe such a highly fragmented mythos that everybody
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:15.960]   has their own and there's no agreement anymore on a moral framework or...
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   Kellyanne Conway was actually president.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.880]   It's all made up anyway and it's kind of like Bitcoin versus fiat currency.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.560]   Bitcoin undermines fiat currency because you suddenly realize just as Bitcoin is based
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:33.200]   on nothing, neither is the dollar bill and it all can start to crumble if people stop
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.200]   believing.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   It's all made up.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:44.000]   As soon as people don't hold these truths to be self-evident, even because they're not,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   they're all made up.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.200]   As soon as people kind of see through that and we get into post-fact society, everything
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.080]   falls apart.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   Kellyanne Conway was more prescient than she certainly knew when she talked about alternative
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.080]   facts.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.080]   She may have understood that.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.360]   It may be that she understood that.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.800]   I'll give her more credit than you do.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.560]   By the way, I just put it on the rundown.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.480]   Alex Stamos, the chief security officer of Facebook, just put up an update on the Russian
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.480]   ads.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   Oh, good.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.480]   Let me look at that.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.480]   Okay.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.880]   So, that's what I feel like we're in this...
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.880]   Why we're in this...
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880]   I think we are.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.040]   ...is time of shifting sands.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:23.160]   So, an update on information operations on Facebook.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.080]   Skip to the very bottom.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:30.720]   We will continue to invest in our people and technology to help provide a safe place for
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.920]   civic discourse and meaningful connections.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.800]   They call this misuse of their platform.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.640]   Alex, by the way, is awesome.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.640]   I have huge respect for him.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.640]   I don't think he...
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.600]   Where was Alex before?
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.080]   He was at Uber before, wasn't he?
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.080]   I thought somewhere not so good.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.840]   I think he was a list of people.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840]   No, he was at Yahoo.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:59.680]   He was at Yahoo and he left because there was a breach and Merse Meijer didn't tell him.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.680]   He was so authentic.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   That's what it was.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.320]   That he walked out the door and went over to Facebook.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.960]   But he's a good security guy.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:12.400]   So, 3,000 ads, about 470 inauthentic accounts and pages in violation of our policies.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   Interesting.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.160]   We don't allow inauthentic accounts on Facebook.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.600]   They've shut down.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:24.840]   The vast majority of these ads were run by accounts, didn't specifically reference US
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.640]   presidential election voting on other pretendites.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.200]   Rather, the ads and accounts appear to focus on amplifying divisive social and political
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.280]   messages across the ideological spectrum.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:40.920]   One quarter were geographically targeted and of those more ran in 2015 and 16.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.040]   The majority displayed by these accounts, amplified divisive messages were consistent
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.800]   with the techniques mentioned in the white paper we released in April about information
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.800]   operations.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:56.400]   It's hard to get people interested or upset about this, isn't it?
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:01.480]   I mean, you can say, look, we're being manipulated.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   People going, yeah, not really.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.480]   I'm not worried about it.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.120]   Oh, this is what read the data in society report, read the NATO report.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.120]   I understand.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.120]   We know about it.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.120]   We know it.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:16.600]   But I don't think the general public gives two figs about it.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.360]   And that's part of the point is that's part of the goal.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.320]   The goal is to make them say, ah, you're all corrupt and nothing's true anyway.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.240]   Well, the goal is to break down the mythos.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.160]   It's that prison America is a myth.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   Yes.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.160]   And it is.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.800]   Yeah, it's a myth, but it's a myth that we need to believe in if we're going to continue
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.600]   to move forward.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.000]   And so, but it's very fragile.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.280]   If you start, if you can get people to stay, oh, yeah, I used to, I've been seeing this
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.280]   for years, geeks especially saying, oh, governments, it doesn't make any differences.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.440]   Meaningless, it's corrupt.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.240]   I'm not going to participate.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.240]   Institutions are myths, education is a myth.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.240]   It's all myths.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.240]   It's all myths.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.240]   It's all myths.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.600]   If we believe in it, other other other bricks go on top.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.640]   What's what makes societies, what makes civilization?
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.800]   Civilization is fundamentally a myth, but it's, but if you want order, you need to get
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.960]   people to believe in it.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.680]   At least somewhat or at least pay lips.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.880]   And what I concentrate a lot these days is, is civility.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.280]   Um, yep.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:24.440]   I think part of what's happening is that we have the institutions of your, we have government
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:30.760]   media, corporations, NGOs, and there's a fifth institution, which is communities.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.080]   And there's a great good to be had in that.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.200]   I find my people, I can connect with people.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.720]   I can do things with them.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.240]   There's also a bad in that people who aren't in my community are bad.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.040]   The strangers are others.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:46.080]   I trust my friends and my community more than I do doctors and lawyers and accountants
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.040]   and professors.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:54.920]   We're at a point where people are refiguring their alliances and beliefs around these
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.920]   institutions.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.920]   It's a hard time.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.760]   And it's going to be, we're not, we're tool, all of us are tool to see how this turns
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   out.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.760]   Sorry.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.560]   I worry about my, you're right.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:11.760]   And in some ways I kind of am glad about that, but I worry about my kids.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.840]   We all have kids roughly the same age.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.960]   We're entering this, this new world.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:16.960]   Yep.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.600]   We're in a world like we grew up in.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.600]   It's a very different world.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.800]   It's not a world like 2003.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.800]   Those innocent days come in.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:30.200]   You know, you've got, you've got fairly intractable problems, not to mention super storms heading
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   up the coast.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.680]   I mean, it's, it's terrifying.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.440]   Is it just being, is just, I feel like I'm trying to, in my own mind, am I just getting
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   old?
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.800]   Is this, or is this really look bad?
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.360]   Is this objectively bad?
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.040]   This is, this is a bad company.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.200]   I feel like it's objectively bad, but I don't know.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.200]   I love this.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.840]   It ain't, it ain't World War II.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.640]   It's a part of it.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.120]   2003, we didn't have this power.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.840]   So it was easy for us to pontificate about it and do this because 2003 Google wasn't
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.760]   what it is now.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:08.320]   And part of this comes from this, this sort of weird thing where these companies overshoot
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.680]   on their scrappiness because they start out as the outsider and they've got to compete
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:19.240]   with the status quo and it takes them world where they've become the status quo.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:25.960]   So if you're, you know, if you're Larry Page, you may still think of yourself as the scrappy
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:31.320]   outsider, even though you're now the CEO of the biggest source of information in the
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.480]   world.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:37.200]   And this was very much true of Intel and it was true of Microsoft and to some extent
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.720]   it's true of Google as well.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:43.520]   And I'm sure, you know, Facebook had had that sense as they were growing too.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.440]   You start out being the outsider and you're saying, there is this establishment, there
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.000]   is this power sentence, there's all this stuff going on in the world, we're just this
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.080]   little company, there's 10 of us, we're trying to do this thing.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:59.200]   But then you ramp up and you overshoot on that sort of sense of being the outsider
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   that's trying to change the world and don't realize that you are an establishment and
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.040]   also that your Twitter is an establishment as well.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:12.040]   And so they may not, you know, this was certainly true when I was working at Google, you know,
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:17.280]   Avalon Go It was eight, nine years ago, was that the execs didn't quite realize how much
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.480]   power they had and they'd make this pronouncement, then PR would have to go spend a lot of time
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:26.080]   cleaning up after them because they'd said something that they thought was, you know,
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.360]   a thorn experiment and everyone else thought was a policy statement.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:34.840]   You know, when Larry said it would be nice to find an island somewhere that didn't have
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.800]   any laws that we could experiment with this stuff.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:42.400]   That was a little peak under the curtain there.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.600]   I also think it was the last time he had a, he never went public again.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.040]   That was his last public utterance.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.240]   I'm fairly sure he got a bit of a telling off.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.240]   Yes.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.240]   By who?
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.040]   Who is going to tell Larry Page off?
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.040]   Sir, OK.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.040]   Let's face.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.240]   No, no, who's the PR person?
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.280]   The one who's now Uber, what's the name?
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   British lady.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:13.160]   You know, and we'll come back to me.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.680]   But a lot of things, you know, I was not able to worry more.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.680]   She left.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.680]   I went to Facebook.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.680]   You see that last very long.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.680]   Oh, she went to Facebook.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.680]   There you go.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.680]   The Facebook now.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.680]   There you go.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.680]   There you go.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.680]   So.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:31.880]   So I think, by the way, I think Mark Zuckerberg, people said why would he want to be president
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.880]   of the who?
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.880]   Rachel.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.880]   What's done?
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:35.880]   What's done?
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:36.880]   She went stand.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.880]   People say, why would Mark Zuckerberg want to take a step down and become president of
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.880]   the United States?
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.960]   I suddenly realized he doesn't want to be president of the United States.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:47.160]   He sees a world, a one world power.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.800]   He wants to rule the world.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   Well, no.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.800]   So here's the stupid kind of question.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.880]   Are we moving in that direction?
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.360]   Well, here's this way.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.320]   Here's a stupid question for you.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:02.280]   This is like a USA Today's stupid poll.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.800]   Who's more powerful today?
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   Right.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   Larry Page or Donald Trump?
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.520]   Well, Donald Trump's got nukes.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:13.200]   So there is a little bit of a hope you can't use them.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   Well, he can.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:19.560]   And so I think that's the problem is government isn't on the same scale as enterprise.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:23.240]   However, because of the rise of the rise of the law.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.480]   But yours are now filled with bits.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:26.480]   Not necessarily with with the core.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.960]   I think we're approaching that here.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.440]   But Schmidt used to say this.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.080]   Schmidt would say, who do you trust more to tell you the truth, the government or Google?
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.080]   Right.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.080]   I think they're on equal.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.080]   And he was making it specific.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   Neither.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.960]   A lot of the time, but no, but we do trust Google.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.680]   I mean, Google was, you know, now it'll give us some answers.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.320]   Nowadays, we'll often give us wrong answers and we'll call them out on it and they'll
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.320]   gradually fix it.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.360]   But it's kind of like those three moralities.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:56.640]   I think neither one will tell you, they'll tell you their truth.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.640]   Okay.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.520]   I've got a clip for you.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   If you can play a clip.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.520]   Sure.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.520]   Well, right now we're having trouble.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.120]   I think with our switcher, because it's been sitting on Jeff for a while and this happened
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.120]   to you.
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.120]   We don't want back.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.840]   We don't want Jeff to have too much air time.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:10.840]   No, no, no, no.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.840]   You put it in the chat.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.840]   Clear proof.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.840]   It's broken.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:14.840]   You put here is it's in the chatroom.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.840]   All right.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.840]   Let me open this up.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.840]   TV clip from from Terry Pratchett.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.840]   Oh, this is Terry Pratchett.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.840]   You put this quote up earlier.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:21.840]   I like this.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.840]   This is from earlier.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.320]   This is from a movie called Hogfather.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:28.720]   Well, it was originally a novel by Terry Pratchett called Hogfather.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.160]   This is the TV version of it.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.600]   Are you getting my audio, Carson?
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.600]   You know?
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.600]   Okay.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.600]   Here we go.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:41.520]   This is Susan Death's granddaughter talking to Death at the end of the time where they've
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:46.120]   defeated the auditors and restored Christmas or Hogmas.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:51.920]   Anyway, so the key thing you need to know is the male voice here is death.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.420]   Yes.
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.560]   And Susan is Death's grandmother was actually fixing human.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.560]   Okay.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.560]   Let me go back.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:01.040]   You're saying that humans need fantasies to make life bearable.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.040]   No.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:08.600]   Humans need fantasy to be human.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   To be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.520]   With two fairies, Hogfathers.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.520]   Yes.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:24.520]   As practice, you have to start out learning to believe the little lies.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.560]   So we can believe the big ones.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:31.360]   Yes, justice, mercy, duty, that sort of thing.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:34.160]   And they're not the same at all.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.360]   You think so?
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:41.760]   Then take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:49.840]   finest sieve and then show me one atom of justice, one molecule of mercy.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.320]   And yet.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:59.440]   You try to act as if there is some ideal order in the world as if there is some some
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:04.520]   rightness in the universe by which it may be judged.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.440]   But people have got to believe that.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.920]   What's the point?
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:14.920]   You need to believe in things that aren't true.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.760]   How else can they become?
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.760]   Wow.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.760]   I love that.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.760]   That's awesome.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.240]   And I'm very, very, yeah.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.440]   I've never seen Hogfather.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.440]   You need to watch Hogfather.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.440]   What's your Christmas?
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.440]   It's a Christmas movie.
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:33.120]   It's kind of Christmas, but it's very well done.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:38.760]   It's like a very Pratchett who is, you know, he reminds me a lot of Douglas Adams, both
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:45.800]   of whom understood this thing that, you know, eventually everybody comes to realize it's
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.520]   all made up.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.520]   And then now what?
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.680]   Let's take a break.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:55.680]   Kevin Marks is here undermining our very most fundamental beliefs.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.920]   Hey, he does that time to time at indyweb.org.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.160]   Jeff Jarvis, he's pretty much the same.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:07.480]   He's at buzzmachine.com and we are talking about all sorts of stuff.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.000]   I could talk about a shiny object.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.880]   I got the new essential phone.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:13.280]   I'm dying to hear about that.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.280]   Oh, good.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.080]   This is what we need to distract ourselves.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.160]   Things like this, little shiny objects.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.160]   Yes.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.720]   This show, I am, this show is way too smart for me.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.160]   I hope you're enjoying it.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:30.000]   I showed they brought to you by a great company doing great stuff.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.240]   Qualcomm and the Qualcomm Snapdragon Gigabit LTE.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:42.120]   This is empowering devices and many of the newest devices you're using are actually using
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.080]   this Snapdragon Gigabit.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.760]   Go to snapdragon.com/gigabit to find out more.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:55.400]   The Samsung Galaxy Note 8, the S8 active, the Moto Z Force, the HTC U11, the Galaxy S8.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:00.480]   These are all devices with this new Gigabit LTE.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:05.480]   Designed to deliver the fastest mobile connectivity and help speed things up in crowded places.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:13.440]   LTE, Gigabit LTE, 4x4 MIMO, many channels to let your data flow on and squeeze more
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.800]   speed from every LTE connection.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:19.440]   It's like driving in a much wider, much faster data highway.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:24.320]   Download speeds on average LTE download speeds are up to seven times faster than your home
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.320]   Wi-Fi.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.040]   Then your home Wi-Fi.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.240]   It could turbocharge all your connected apps.
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.360]   Download the latest game from the Play Store on the go faster than you can at home.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:38.080]   Access all your files in the cloud, nearly as fast as you would if they were stored on
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.080]   your phone.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.880]   Load Android Instant Apps, well, almost instantly.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:47.320]   Next Dragon, Gigabit LTE technology, it uses the network so much more efficiently.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.480]   You'll be leaving plenty of room for others to make the most of their data plans as well.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.680]   There's a lot more information.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:57.560]   That's just the 30,000 foot, but there's a lot more information on the page.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:02.120]   Make the most of your unlimited data plan with epic download speeds and the newest Android
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:15.720]   devices at snapdragon.com/gigabit carrier aggregation 4x4 MIMO, 256 quam, LTEU, LAA.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:20.360]   There's a lot of information, including some great snapdragon podcasts that explain it
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   all.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.880]   Snapdragon, Gigabit LTE.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.960]   Find out more at snapdragon.com/gigabit.
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.960]   We thank Qualcomm for their support.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.880]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:33.040]   That's fascinating in itself.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.040]   I know.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.040]   Qualcomm ever advertised.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.040]   Not that I know of.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.040]   Modems inside of phones.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.320]   But it reminds me of Intel inside.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:44.880]   Intel has spent a lot of money to persuade you that Intel chips are better.
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:48.520]   But that was just kind of branding saying, "Oh, we're in telling you trust us and we're
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.520]   wonderful.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.600]   You've heard of us."
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:56.600]   This is interesting because it's also a specific consumer benefit.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:57.600]   Well, but they're also ever touched.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.800]   Notice where they're buying the ad.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.160]   They're aiming at a technically literate audience.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.640]   Oh, no, I get that.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:04.640]   That's very cool.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:08.840]   Yeah, when they call this up, I said, "Yeah, you bet."
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:09.840]   Talk about it.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:10.840]   I didn't advertise it.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.840]   That's appropriate for the show.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.840]   Absolutely.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:18.240]   In fact, there's rumors that Microsoft's going to announce new Surface devices running Qualcomm
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   ARM chips.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.240]   I'm downloading Oreo.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.240]   I just got it.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:29.240]   I have to think that the Pixel 2 will have it.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.240]   I have it.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.240]   I gave up.
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:46.560]   I finally went to the beta channel and said, "Do you notice any difference?
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:50.200]   I don't notice a huge amount of difference."
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.080]   There's some subtle things.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:56.800]   The ARS Technica review was really helpful because as often is the case with these things,
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.080]   it told me a bunch of things that I was like, "Did that change or was?"
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:02.040]   Yeah, Ron and Mario did a brilliant job.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.480]   This is a 20,000 word review.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.480]   Oh, it's unbelievable.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.960]   It was really...
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:12.000]   The piece I just linked to actually ties up with the Qualcomm thing because I hadn't
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.760]   actually clocked this in detail before and you've probably covered this not about Android
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.760]   already.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:27.880]   One of the key changes they've made in Oreo is the ability to upgrade parts of the OS
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.880]   independently of the OEMs.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:31.880]   Project Treble.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.880]   Project Treble, yes.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:40.040]   Yeah, Google's had to do this because the biggest problem with Android is these older
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:44.360]   Android phones that just will never be secure because they'll never be upgraded.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:51.320]   By extracting bits of the OS, they've been doing this for a while and making it obtainable.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:56.520]   Well, but part of the part of this is what they said was they realized that they were
[00:59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.000]   dealing with huge numbers of OEMs, they were dealing with a bunch of carriages, a whole
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.080]   bunch of stuff going on, but they were dealing with a smaller number of chipset makers.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.360]   What they did was they said, "Okay, let's define hardware abstraction layers around the
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:14.320]   chipsets and then we will simplify the problem because then we're dealing with a lot of
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:19.560]   things with Qualcomm and a bunch of a few other chip makers like them and we can work
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:24.320]   with them directly and once we've got that piece abstracted, then the OEMs can layer
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.760]   on some software stuff in between.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:32.520]   They basically restructured the software stack to focus on the abstraction of the hardware
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:37.120]   out so that it's easier to do probably this stuff in multiple stages.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:43.360]   Isn't this what Microsoft did years ago with their hardware abstraction layer, the idea
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:50.000]   because there was such a heterogeny in the hardware that they had to really lift the
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.920]   operating system above that and then have a layer that is interfaced with the hardware.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.340]   Just let me say Apple does it too.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:01.880]   So Apple has a hardware abstraction layer and they have multiple vendors and they get
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.640]   them to compete for each piece of the site they're building and then they pick one for
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.640]   each release.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:17.280]   So way back when I was at Apple even longer ago than 2000 ish, the point there was we
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.000]   would define hardware abstraction layer and then we would go to the vendors and say,
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.200]   "Okay, implement this hardware abstraction layer and we'll see which one of you does
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.720]   better and we'll ship that one in this product."
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.320]   And the goal was always to have more than one vendor for each piece of the system so
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:37.120]   that you could have multiple bids and no one was able to hold your postage.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.000]   So that's less true now and part of the reason they end up buying some of those companies
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.920]   and doing these long-term deals was that they are so much of the market, it's harder for
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:50.000]   them to ramp up the delivery of the vendors and so.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.960]   But this is a similar thing.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:56.200]   They said, "Okay, there's a choke point here.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.960]   We can have a large number of OEM vendors who build different devices and things on
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.320]   the end, but there's only so many chipsets that are made because making a chipset is
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.640]   a huge investment of time and money and physical, silicone and stuff."
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:14.920]   So Ron pointed out that to update Android, Google has to go, but after Google does its
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.400]   update, it then has to go through three major steps going to the system on a chip vendors
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:27.120]   like Qualcomm or Samsung and get them, or this is in the past, get them to vet the release
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.960]   and modify it for their hardware.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:35.360]   Then the OEM, Samsung and LG get the OS, test it with their theme modifications and so
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.360]   forth.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.880]   And then finally, the carriers get it and it's usually the carriers that send it out
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.360]   to the users.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:47.560]   But each and we know this, each step not only causes delay but also offers a roadblock.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.360]   Any one of those people could say, "Yeah, we're not going to update it for those phones."
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:58.880]   So Project Treble has a vendor interface, a standard interface that sits between the
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.720]   OS and the hardware.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:07.080]   The system on a chip vendor, Qualcomm, for instance, plugs into that interface, which
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.800]   is basically what we call a hardware extraction layer, and the OS plugs into it.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.280]   And so that way, the system on a chip vendor doesn't have to do as much work to get the
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.680]   new version of Android working.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.560]   We still have some customization, but at least that can be done in parallel.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.400]   You don't have to wait for the system on a chip.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.640]   So they have a new vendor test suite.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.240]   Yeah, this is stuff that when you get your Android phone running Oreo, you're not going
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.160]   to notice a change there.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.160]   But it's a big deal for us.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.920]   And you like this for a while, yeah.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.360]   It'll make it possible to update these phones faster and for a longer period of time, which
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:46.040]   is really, I applaud Google for really focusing on that and working on that.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.160]   So, basically, they're going to improve battery life.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.320]   They have these progressive loading apps now.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.280]   There's a lot of features.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:04.600]   Even a few new, the way the system setting tray works is a little bit different.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.800]   The problem is you can't really describe it unless we're all talking about pixel phones,
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.040]   because almost everybody else customizes it heavily and it just, you won't see the same
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.880]   changes.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:23.400]   I don't see a huge difference on my pixel, but you want the latest, I presume.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.640]   Well, you see this sort of notification changes.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.200]   That's a big change, yeah.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.600]   It's called strangers went to sleep on me.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:37.640]   So the notifications have got more distinguishing between them.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.160]   The live plane one picks up the color.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160]   Right.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.160]   That's kind of neat.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:52.320]   I'm not going to be able to demonstrate this because you have to get the right kind of
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.600]   notifications, but basically it tells you when there's stuff running the background.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.200]   And you get those doing there.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:05.440]   As you pull down notifications, you see the little icons come out of there and turn it
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.440]   back in.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.440]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.440]   Go back in again.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:12.160]   So, there's a set of interesting stuff about the notifications.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.360]   So the apps now get little dots on them.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:18.880]   I've got any, oh yeah, a Gmail at the bottom has one, but they're not, they're not counts
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.960]   like on iOS because counts are kind of stressful.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.280]   It's just a dark thing.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.280]   You've got mail.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:29.440]   Just a little lot saying you've got mail, then you, if you hold it down, it shows you
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.320]   the notification there as well.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.320]   And that's nice.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.840]   And then you can, and you just miss that on its own or whatever, or click through.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.480]   So there's, there's, it's not like, oh, this is going to change the world.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.240]   It's more like they spent a lot of time sweating the details and making a lot of these things
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.920]   that are already quite good a bit better.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.800]   They're also clamping down on way clocks, which is the bane of battery life applications
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:56.240]   that wake your phone up and keep them awake while they do stuff.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.480]   Apparently Android will manage this.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:02.240]   There won't be, this is kind of what Apple did and gets very good battery life on the
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.120]   iPhone because of it.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:09.680]   Free running background services are no longer a thing in Android.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.680]   That's good news.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:14.200]   And when stuff is running the background, it tells you.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.400]   Let's see.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.840]   They're going to, you know, a little more efficiency here and there.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.000]   I don't, this is more of an under the hood upgrade than it is a feature update.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.880]   I don't think they didn't, they didn't, they didn't hype it a lot.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:34.080]   No, the biggest, I think single biggest new features is Google Play Protect.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:40.920]   Google says, do not install antivirus apps, we'll take care of this.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.200]   You'll see a badge on the Android device.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.960]   It'll say Google Play Protect.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:54.200]   And I guess among other things it scans, continually scans for malware, looking for
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.400]   known flaws.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:02.880]   It'll do that for apps on the Play Store, but it will also scan apps that you've downloaded
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.240]   from third parties and sideloaded.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.680]   Google says it scans half a million apps a day and any newly discovered apps get queued
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.320]   up for deeper analysis.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.640]   I don't know what else, let's see.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.520]   This is apps kind of say at 720, 1720.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.680]   So that's, I don't know if that's window dressing because Google did some of this before, although
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.200]   it was only doing it on the Play Store, I guess.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:39.080]   But a lot of this is about making the phone, I think there's three prongs, more secure,
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:44.400]   better performance and battery life.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.240]   And then a few some cosmetic stuff.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.760]   Stage fright, which has always been a little bit of a problem, the media framework is getting
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:55.600]   a little bit of protected protection, the how.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:03.000]   That's part of the same trouble hardware abstraction layer, so they've basically made it hard,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.920]   made fewer things, have direct contact with the hardware and wrap those in abstraction
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.880]   layers so that they've got more control of them.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:14.040]   So that's a good, this is sort of another reason to do that same kind of work.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:20.640]   Web users sandboxed running in isolated instances, that's both for reliability and security.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:25.200]   You'll have to use a password if you turn on developer options, but most importantly,
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.240]   new emoji.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.240]   That's the thumbs.
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.400]   Oh, what happens here?
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.560]   This is a Windows thing.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.400]   The thumbs are gone.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.480]   They're now round.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.880]   No more of those, you know, half, half rounds.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.160]   It's a little sad.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.160]   Well, good news.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.720]   There's an emoji for that guy crying.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.520]   He's like, he's crying.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:50.520]   This is a puking emoji.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.520]   This is a head shock.
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:53.520]   Is it giraffe?
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.520]   Yeah, very exciting.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.680]   It's funny that you should bring up both the head shock and the puking emoji.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:04.600]   I think we talked about those same two emoji on Windows weekly.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:11.720]   But also, the other part of this restructuring is that emoji and fonts are now resources
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.840]   that you can have control of without them being part of the operating system.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.840]   How long are you?
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:21.920]   If it's to update emoji without having to update the operating system and if they get
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.240]   this right, that will mean they can backport these emoji to old OSs as well.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:29.880]   They're not as tightly bound.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:35.640]   What was the last time we used to make a big deal of a new OS, either in computer or
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.640]   phone?
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.960]   I think those days are over.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.360]   Well, it was the last time you got excited about it.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.600]   It's all incremental now.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.440]   I mean, you can't just just fall in.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.400]   Yeah, it's hard to imagine.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:51.280]   I mean, I think that that's what's happening with Apple, the new iPhone.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.480]   But we'll see if Apple delivers.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.600]   It's very hard to come up with something so new that you go crazy.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:03.600]   Well, I mean, Apple is like the last holdout of the Big Bang release, really.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.920]   Everything else has gone continuous.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.000]   And that is an overall, that's a good thing.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.040]   You don't have to think about upgrading stuff as much because the upgrades happen in the
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.200]   background silently, incrementally.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.440]   And you don't notice that they've changed.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:23.640]   The browsers going that way was a huge, huge thing that made a massive improvement.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.560]   And a lot of it is because we have the web and we can do that.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:32.200]   I remember when software was stuff that you package on CD-ROMs and put in shelves, that's
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:36.440]   what we had to do, so that the process was built that way.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.720]   And Apple still retained some of that because they release a lot of their software with
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.200]   their new machines.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:50.440]   So in a month or so, they'll push out some new hardware and then we'll suddenly realize
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.120]   what those features are, so we'll have more really for.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.920]   And they're still bound like that, whereas everyone else is much more decoupled now.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.320]   And overall, that's a good thing.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.880]   It means that it's easier to patch things and that often means it's easier to patch
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.280]   security problems as well.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.600]   But yeah, as you say, you don't say, "Oh, I've really, you don't have the, I've got
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.800]   a cool night to get Oreo." It'll just like trickle out to your phone at some point.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:15.800]   Right.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.960]   There's finally color management.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.880]   I didn't realize this, but Android never had color management.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:25.200]   All desktop computers do, of course, but this will help make colors more consistent on
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.160]   different phones.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:31.920]   There's a physics-based animation and there's a new octopus Easter egg.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.560]   I was playing with that before, yeah.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.480]   Yeah, it used to be a cat, right?
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:38.280]   Now it's an Easter, now it's an octopus.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.760]   To get it, of course, you have to tap the...
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.560]   Let me go and fight it again.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.560]   Hang on.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:50.360]   Yeah, you have to tap on Android version a bunch of times, then long press on the logo.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.600]   There was a cat game, remember the Neko cat game in Android 7?
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:02.960]   Android 6 had a flappy bird and then press that button and lo and behold, a squishy octopus
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:03.960]   will appear.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:04.960]   Apparently.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.440]   Oh, and a pressy hard enough?
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.800]   You work quite on the center.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.600]   You work quite on the center.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:19.400]   There's also support for SD cards, the new file system, SD card FS, which might make...
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:24.800]   This has always been kind of a screwy the way SD cards sported.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.360]   There's a squishy octopus.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.360]   Oh, he's so cute.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.360]   There we go.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.360]   He's so cute.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.360]   And you can squish him.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.360]   Hang on.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:37.160]   Boot up times increased doubled.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.400]   Oh, hopefully.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.560]   Existing OS.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.320]   Graphics drivers can now be updated.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.400]   They've been pulled out into the play store as an APK.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.200]   That's good news.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.040]   Support for Bluetooth 5.
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.960]   Of course, your hardware will also have to support it.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:58.520]   That improves the connectivity, doubles it to 50 megabits with quadruple the range and
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:03.640]   eight times the messaging capacity over Bluetooth 4LE.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:09.000]   There's also support for aptX, the new Qualcomm's Bluetooth codec for better quality sound.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.560]   And Sony's LDAC.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.920]   Again, hardware support is required.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.640]   There's a printer service out of the box.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.320]   You don't have to download a plug-in anymore.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.320]   Oh.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:27.020]   Default printer service compatibility with 100 million Mopria certified printers Xerox
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:31.000]   Brother, Lexmark, Dell, HP, Samsung, Canon, and Epson.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.840]   97% according to Google of Printer, Sold World.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.840]   Why?
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.400]   A big improvement here for musicians.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.320]   A low latency audio API.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.560]   This is always-- and I always blame the Linux kernel.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:47.320]   This is always a problem for Android users compared to iPad users.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:56.080]   There was a 10 millisecond delay in the audio latency, which made it very difficult to
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.940]   do live performance stuff.
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:04.060]   So you really didn't see a lot of audio apps on Android, but they say they fixed it.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:05.060]   We'll see.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.780]   They've made it-- well, they haven't really fixed it.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.420]   There's a new API.
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:12.780]   There's a new API you have to use instead that gives it a fast path.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:15.940]   But it's still-- it's still to have the Linux problems.
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:16.940]   This is very hard to fix.
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:17.940]   And this was something--
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.740]   Yeah, because it's in the kernel, right?
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:20.740]   Yeah.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:27.520]   It's basically the Linux kernel is still a push model and the iOS kernel is a pull model.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:33.820]   And so that is-- that dates back to OS 10 and goes back long enough that I was working
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.260]   there when we were changing it.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:42.000]   And the difference is that on OS 10 and iOS, there is a very low level interrupt that is
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.480]   running the audio that is pulling the chain all the way through the system, which means
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:53.400]   that-- and that has higher approach than memory, which means that you can have audio latency
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.400]   without anything gapping.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:59.840]   Whereas Linux still has the sort of file system view of audio where you're writing stuff
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.760]   to a file and then buffers it a bit.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.880]   And if you want it to not gap, you increase the buffer size.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.920]   So the lag goes up all the time.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.120]   And that is very hard to fix.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:14.520]   And Google has been talking about fixing this properly for several years now.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.880]   And they're walking towards it.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:27.680]   But I suspect that the newer kernels they're talking about to replace the Android and Chrome
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:33.720]   kernels that we've talked about these before may well be what they need to do to do this
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:34.820]   in the long run.
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:40.640]   But in the meantime, they've got a new audio API at the system level that is designed to
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.440]   have a lower latency.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.760]   And again, it's an opt-in one.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:49.000]   You basically, in the same way that iOS and iOS tended this, you're basically saying in
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.680]   order to work with this API, I guarantee that I will respond within this time or you will
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:57.720]   shut me up.
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.720]   So there it is.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.560]   Thanks to Ron Amadio for a 20,000 word summary.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.560]   Great.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.000]   There's a lot in there.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.160]   If you care about Android, this is definitely worth reading.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.160]   But that was--
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.160]   He's done a great job.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.160]   Now, to read.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.320]   And I think we gave you the highlights there.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.880]   This is the essential phone mine came yesterday.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:24.440]   I did not get a pre-production version.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.320]   It is very apparently beautiful.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.160]   I mean, when you hold it in your hand, you'll love it.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.160]   Titanium and ceramic build.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:37.200]   It's got these two little pogo pins up here on the back for the doohickeys.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.200]   There's a 360-degree camera.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.200]   I'm impressed.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.280]   You know the jargon for what you call those pins.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:46.120]   Well, you see them on a lot of devices, including the new iPads, the smart connector.
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.240]   It's just electrical connectors.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.880]   I have to say, when I first opened the desk, I said, what is it?
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:51.880]   Extra flash.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:56.240]   But on a closer inspection, you see it's-- they're actually just metal connectors.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.760]   There's dual lenses.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.520]   The camera is buggy as heck.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.120]   I was hoping that they would have fixed this.
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.720]   A lot of the reviewers mentioned this in the pre-production.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.720]   It's latent.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.560]   It crashed the phone, did a hard reset for me once.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.680]   It crashed itself another time.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.680]   It does have a monochrome mode, which looks quite good.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:15.360]   Takes advantages-- advantage, I guess, of the dual lenses.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.360]   The dual lenses aren't like on an iPhone where you can zoom in.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.800]   They're both active all the time.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:23.520]   I gather because there's no separate lens.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.120]   Are they right next to each other?
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.120]   Pretty close.
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.120]   It's close.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.840]   I'm not sure exactly how that works.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.800]   But there are still problems with the camera app.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.040]   I've heard some people download-- aside load the Google camera APK and it's faster and
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.360]   works better.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.760]   So I expect to central fix the camera.
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:49.960]   You look at it and it's not only is it a fingerprint-- it's beautiful, but it's a fingerprint magnet.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:55.360]   There's the monochrome mode of it.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.440]   It really looks fragile.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.360]   In fact, we already got some hairline scratches on the bottom.
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.560]   I've only had it a day.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.200]   Jason Howell had it yesterday for all about.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:07.960]   Andrew, I'm going to give it back to him after this so he can review it for the new screensavers.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.360]   Your staff says that Jason ruins all the phone.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.640]   Well, unaccountably, it's already got a crack in the glass on the front.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.080]   I know I didn't do that, but I think-- and Jason, I don't think, dropped it.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:22.320]   So I think I'm wondering now-- this could be a manufacturing defect.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.120]   I don't know.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.760]   The screen is beautiful.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.400]   If you compare it, I'll show you.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.000]   It's got a screen roughly the same size as the iPhone 7 5 1/2 inch screen.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.280]   If you compare it to the iPhone 7, though, you'll see how much smaller it is.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:40.160]   And that's where the lack of bezels really makes a difference.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.400]   All phones going for will have a lack of bezels.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.080]   So there's one thing that makes that difficult is the camera on the front.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.720]   If you don't have a frame, the camera has to notch out the screen.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.480]   Apple's apparently going to do this as well.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:57.440]   The good news is on Android because it's where the notification bar is and the notifications
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.680]   are kind of split between left and right.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.280]   You see it, but it's not functionally going to make too much of a difference.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.680]   You've got a game, it will, or something like that.
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:10.680]   It does not have a headphone jack.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.600]   And to me, that's kind of a deal breaker.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.320]   It's type C charging.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:19.520]   And it comes with a type C adapter so that you can connect a headphone jack.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.120]   But I just have to wonder why don't they include headphone jacks?
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.280]   I guess to save space.
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.480]   And it does feel great in the hand.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.400]   It's very small.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.000]   But this is not going to be given that we've got the Note 8 coming out.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.840]   We've got the LG V30 coming out.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:37.720]   We've got an iPhone next generation coming out.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:43.240]   And it's early in October, Google's expected to announce the new pixels.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.000]   I don't know if there's room for this phone.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.960]   It is practically a virgin Android.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.240]   I can't even see any customizations.
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.200]   But it's 7.1.1.
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.840]   So it's not the most recent Android.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.280]   It's not running the audio.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.760]   It's not even running the most recent Android 7.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:06.640]   So it's unknown how often it will update or whether it will update to Android.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.120]   But I have to think this is--
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:15.360]   I mean, I assume that that will be working on the trouble stuff because of who's running
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.360]   it.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.360]   Yeah, Andy Rubin's company.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.680]   I mean, he's a guy who created Android, right?
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:21.680]   And I think that's--
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.680]   The camera sounds abstractions.
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.920]   If anybody besides Andy Rubin were making this phone, I think it'd be just a complete
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.080]   non-starter.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.360]   But aesthetically, it is gorgeous.
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.640]   The materials used are gorgeous.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.800]   I'm sure they'll fix the camera issue.
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.520]   Get a case for it.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.520]   Yes.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.520]   Oh, it's sad because--
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.320]   I always get a case.
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.960]   Yeah, but you design a beautiful phone.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.520]   But it doesn't matter because if it's in a case, it could be ugly.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.080]   It doesn't matter, right?
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.680]   Well, I mean, this came with a transparent case, but I dropped it enough of that shatter.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.800]   So now I've got a rubber case.
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.960]   And it's exactly-- I've got a pretty blue phone inside this black thing.
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   Who cares?
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.640]   I'm never going to crack and see it.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.160]   You'll see it when you sell it.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.320]   It's got a weird hole in the back for my finger to go on.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:04.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.400]   Yeah, that is one thing.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.680]   I have to say Samsung really screwed the pooch with the fingerprint reader.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:13.240]   The way the Samsung phone does it next to the camera is just a not terrible, terrible
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.240]   idea.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.440]   This is a Pixel XL style or Pixel style fingerprint.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.440]   That's good.
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.680]   No, I was confused by it originally, but it's actually really nice.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.680]   It works.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:23.680]   That's how you hold it.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.160]   You're picking it up like that.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   Very natural.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.160]   Do you think it's that?
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:33.400]   It's a small phone with a big screen and virtually no bezel.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400]   It fits in the hand.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   It feels good.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.200]   This is-- I could see executives buying this phone just because it looks so good.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:42.440]   Just don't drop it.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.400]   We will have I fix it on the new screensavers as well.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:52.440]   They said it is one in repairability because it is just terrible.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:56.320]   It's just you can't take it apart.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.160]   They were underwhelmed.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.160]   And there are already rumors.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:05.160]   There will be a second generation coming soon, fixing some of these complaints.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.160]   It's interesting.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.160]   It's Andy.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.160]   I'm glad Andy is doing something.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.080]   I have all the respect in the world for him.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.280]   He worked at Danger.
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:18.120]   Absolutely worked at Android and then was sold to a company to Google.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:24.360]   There's a review by Darrell Atherington in TechCrunch who said how the essential phone
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.120]   won me over completely.
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:29.120]   It's emotional here.
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.120]   It is emotional.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.840]   It is emotional when you see it.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:32.840]   You hold it.
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.720]   It really feels very, very nice.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:39.480]   But the fact that it's cracked already has taken some of the luster off.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.200]   He praises the monochrome camera.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:51.840]   Gosh, this is a fine phone but in a very competitive field that is going to be extremely crowded
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.080]   in the next two months.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.080]   Let's see.
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.840]   I think there's some good news here too.
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.680]   I just want to mention that the TechDirt's fight is over.
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.080]   Oh, Mike Masnick, the win?
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.080]   That is great news.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.080]   Yes.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.080]   This is good news.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.080]   I just want to mention this.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.080]   Yes, it's under others.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.080]   Just dismissed it.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.080]   Wow.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.880]   Shiva Ayudora's defamation suit.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.720]   This guy's long effort to say that he invented email and he goes after everybody.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:20.480]   He went after Gawker and won a settlement.
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:26.040]   A federal charge in Massachusetts has dismissed the libel law.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.040]   A lawsuit.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.840]   Let me see what the judge said here.
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:33.560]   He found it's because it's impossible to define precisely and specifically what email
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.560]   is.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.720]   Ayudora's claim is incapable of being proven true or false.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:43.760]   The judge continued, "One person may consider a claim to be fake if any elephant of it is
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:47.800]   not true or if it involves a slight twisting of the facts, while another person may only
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:51.320]   consider a claim to be fake if no element of it is true."
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.600]   Well, that's an issue for fake news to be to these days.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:03.880]   They did not win under California's anti-slap law, so he cannot have his legal fees paid.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:10.400]   Of course, there's always a possibility of appeal, but he was denied permission to amend
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:16.520]   the complaint and refile it, so he would have to appeal to a higher court.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.680]   This is very good news.
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:21.840]   This is a US district judge, F. Dennis Saylor.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.840]   And I think that's actually exactly right.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.840]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:34.320]   It's weird to think that, I mean, I don't want to get sued by this guy, but it's-
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.320]   Right, exactly.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.320]   I don't need it.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.520]   Speaking of a chilling effect, but it's weird to think that somebody could have invented
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.520]   email.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.720]   It was a year.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.320]   He was like as late as the '70s, I'm trying to remember.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.480]   It was long after email had been invented.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.080]   It was long after I was using email.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:57.000]   He claimed he invented it in high school.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:06.560]   He said he was a high school student in the late '70s and invented email.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:13.680]   Well, another one of these things where the idea of invented is just misunderstood.
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:14.680]   Right.
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:20.160]   And the patent system sort of leads people to was this nonsense, but inventing is not
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.480]   thinking of something, inventing is actually making it work.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:25.840]   He does have a copyright for his program called email.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.840]   So what?
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.360]   There were no software podcasts that have a copyright for the words I say on the show.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.680]   Everyone has the copyright, everything they write ever.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.480]   That was what happened with the Basel.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.400]   Copyright thing in 1976, whenever it was.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.400]   So I wish Stacy were here for one story.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.280]   Well, every story I wish she was here.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.280]   Every story.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.280]   No, no.
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.280]   That's true.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.280]   In particular, Jusaro.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.480]   Oh, the Jusaro story.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.880]   You know, just remember that Stacy knows Doug Evans, right?
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:02.880]   I know she does.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:03.880]   That's what I'd love to hear.
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:08.360]   And she said, has said in the past that he's a nice guy.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:13.360]   He was a restaurant, an entrepreneur.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:19.800]   His restaurants, what were they called, Organic Avenue, something like that, went bankrupt.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:23.200]   But he started this juice company called Jusaro.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:27.600]   Initially, crowdfunded at $700.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.920]   They raised a considerable amount of money.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:31.920]   $102.
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.720]   Oh, sorry about that.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.360]   I hate auto play video.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.520]   Have I mentioned that?
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:39.640]   They raised a considerable amount of money.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:45.880]   Google's Venture Capital Arm and other backers poured $120 million into Jusaro.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:53.040]   They eventually got the machine down to $400 plus the cost of a subscription to the Juice
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.200]   Packs.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:01.120]   The Juice Press, according to Doug Evans, wields four tons of force, enough to lift
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.000]   two Teslas.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.840]   But turned out Bloomberg tried this.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:11.800]   You could squeeze it with your hand.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:16.360]   If you could get the Juice Packs with others, Jusaro, which you couldn't, you could just
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.520]   squeeze them out.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:20.120]   It would be exactly the same.
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.960]   At which point, they are oddwoller.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:24.960]   Yes.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:30.400]   So, Gwyneth Paltrow liked him after working...
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.160]   Ivanka Trumpington.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:36.720]   Really, she liked you, Sarah, too, huh?
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:40.240]   She tweeted out support for Jusaro, yes.
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:48.360]   Doug spent three years building a dozen prototypes of four devising Jusaro's patent pending press.
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:52.840]   In an interview with Recode, he likened his work to the invention of a mainstream personal
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.840]   computer by Steve Jobs.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.440]   In fact, it was quite over-engineered.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.840]   There are 400 custom parts in here.
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:01.840]   There's a scanner.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.840]   There's a microprocessor.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:03.840]   There's a wireless chip.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:04.840]   There's a wireless antenna.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:13.640]   But he actually pitched it as being able to squeeze large chunks of fruits and vegetables.
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:18.360]   But in fact, the stuff was already juiced in the packages.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.960]   Anyway, they've gone bankrupt.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:26.760]   The good news is, and this does, I think, speak well of Doug Evans, they're refunding everybody's
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:27.760]   money.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:33.840]   So, if you bought a Juice Saro at $700 or $400, they say, we'll see.
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:34.840]   They say you'll get rid of that.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.200]   I imagine the investors are terribly happy about that.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:41.200]   I saw pictures, apparently, of the number of Bodegas in New York and elsewhere were using
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.560]   Juice Saro's and selling.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:48.200]   But you won't be able to get the packets anymore either.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:54.560]   The packets were only available in three states until Tuesday when the company expanded to
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:00.320]   17, because the packages can't be shipped long distances.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:07.120]   The whole thing is just, what's most amazing to me is that he raised $120 million.
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.080]   That's amazing.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:10.640]   This is bubbly.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.600]   Yeah, that's bubbly.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:13.600]   It's juicy.
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.720]   It's a juicy time.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:21.280]   People look at Dollar Shave Club and a bunch of other companies doing these subscription services
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:24.280]   probably thought, well, Juice.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.280]   Right?
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:35.040]   But it's between a literally few in rock and a hard place, isn't it?
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.040]   It's between…
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.360]   We have a solution for that.
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:41.320]   It's been naked Juice, not Waller, which is, here's the Juice in a thing, put it in
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.280]   your fridge and drink it.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:47.120]   And those little metal things that squish citrus that I've got one thing to do.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:51.000]   Well, if you ever bought a Juice Saro, I've had an industrial Juice Saro and those things
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.400]   were the Devil.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.680]   Those are the Devil to clean.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:54.680]   They're horrible.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.280]   They understand why people might have thought, oh, look, if you could simplify this.
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.280]   Sure.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:03.400]   No, I mean, if you want to pick apples from the garden and sit them in the juicer and
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:07.720]   make apple juice, yeah, you can do that and it works.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:10.840]   But then you've got to spend 15 minutes scrubbing the damn thing with a brush.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.840]   That's right.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.960]   So you need a self-cleaning juicer.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:14.960]   That's the adventure.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:18.840]   But the point is, this is an AeroPress, right?
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.840]   Right.
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:24.360]   AeroPress was actually a bit of engineering where they said, okay, coffee making is
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.360]   messy.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.160]   What if we reduce the essentials?
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:30.080]   Here's a giant syringe with a filter paper in the bottom.
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:34.760]   The best thing ever invented, by the way, and it's only $30.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.600]   Oh, it's like this.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.320]   It's 25 quid.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.640]   It makes great coffee.
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.640]   Love it.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:48.680]   You know, I've accidentally smashed the French press.
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:52.880]   I bought one of these and I was like, why was I drinking that bad coffee for so long?
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:53.880]   Yes.
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.960]   It's the best coffee maker.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.200]   And it's from the Fox to Do Aerobee, the fake Frisbee.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.760]   But the point is, this is actually thinking about engineering.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:10.640]   It's like, okay, how do we make this thing that actually solves the problem of extracting
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:15.880]   the thing we want, separate the thing we don't want and make it easy to clean?
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:19.560]   And it's not, you don't buy special little pouches from them.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.480]   That's the other thing.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:22.480]   This is no, no.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.480]   It uses real coffee.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.480]   It uses real coffee.
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.680]   You buy a filter papers from them.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:30.480]   They're like, you know, $10 for a 400 away from they are.
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.920]   They last you a year.
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.760]   And this thing will make you coffee.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.600]   And the point is, you then, once you get this, you start buying nice coffee because you can
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:40.600]   taste the damn stuff.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.280]   You can taste the difference.
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.880]   We actually, we're going to France in two weeks.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.480]   We're bringing an AeroPress with us just in case.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:48.480]   No.
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.160]   This is like, I'm not taking a chance.
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.800]   We make sense.
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:55.800]   Why not?
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:56.800]   Right?
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:57.800]   France.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:58.800]   I know.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:31:59.800]   That's what I said.
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:02.560]   We're going to Atlanta coffee, but she also brought one to Ecuador.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:06.840]   So, you know, geez, one now does.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:10.040]   Yes, because you get great beans.
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.040]   She should have brought a hand Berg grinder, however.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.040]   All right.
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.040]   I love it.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:20.760]   I love it, the comparison between Jursero and the AeroPress.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:21.760]   That's perfect.
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:26.000]   You know, that is the difference between an actual disruptive innovation and somebody
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.200]   who's masturbating with too much PC money.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.760]   But sadly, I doubt Aerobe raised $120 million for the AeroPress.
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.000]   They didn't eat it.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000]   It's plastic.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.560]   I'm sure they've sold millions of dollars worth.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.040]   They sold 10 to me alone.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:45.880]   I'm about to buy two more for my sons.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:49.880]   Okay.
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:52.480]   I have a tech thing that I don't know if you've covered.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.280]   Okay.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.440]   But it has since I was lost on this has come out.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:03.880]   This is progressive web apps installation has changed in Chrome 60.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:04.880]   Let's talk about that.
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:05.880]   This is brand new.
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.280]   We haven't talked about this at all.
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:11.600]   So first of all, what are progressive web apps?
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:17.000]   So progressive web apps, it's something that's a marketing term.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:23.120]   It's a way of saying that there was a bunch of things that native apps could do that web
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.640]   apps couldn't do.
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:29.480]   And so some deep work was done with the standardization process to say, how do we make these
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.240]   things more like apps?
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.320]   What's the advantage of apps?
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.640]   What's the drawback of apps?
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.960]   How do we get the advantage of the drawback?
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:39.000]   So the advantage of apps was they have more access to the machine.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.560]   The drawback is they take, you have to do work to install your web and app store and so
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:43.560]   on.
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:51.080]   So what progressive web apps was, it's certain adjustments to the browser that lets it have
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:56.160]   something running in the background, which means that you can work when you're offline.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:00.960]   You can control what's cached when, which means it will work completely offline.
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:09.160]   You can also set it up so that it does notifications and does a bunch of the things that the native
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.160]   apps can do.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:14.840]   And you can do transactions directly, which is the beauty of it for stores and such as
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:18.200]   you can do a transaction directly without having done all of the app.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:22.960]   Can you give me an example of a progressive web app?
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:24.440]   Do we know of any?
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.400]   Washington Post was there.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.000]   Now they're used a lot more.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000]   The advertisers are used like crazy.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.880]   Well, I mean, the idea of why I use this would wind.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:39.880]   So is it a browser extension?
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:43.920]   So okay, what happens is, let me see if I can see this.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:45.360]   I'm running would wind.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.280]   I've used it two or three times.
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:49.320]   It says install this app.
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:54.680]   I clicked the install button a couple of minutes ago, but I now click open.
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:35:00.920]   It opens up and instead of being in the browser, it's now in an app.
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:03.080]   So the browser Chrome at the top has gone.
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.080]   It's now in an app.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.200]   Is this only on mobile?
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.920]   Is that PWA or an Instagram?
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:10.720]   It works on desktop as well.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.160]   So no, it's an app.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:18.440]   So what the thing that changed in Chrome 60 is that it now shows up as an app.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.600]   It should have been an app here before.
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.960]   So it's no longer inside Chrome.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.160]   It's an app.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.160]   What happened?
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:30.120]   Chrome 53 or something.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:38.040]   But the thing now is that it also shows up, if I go to the app overview, it now shows
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.000]   up in there too.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.800]   So they've basically made wrapped an APK around it.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:48.440]   So would win now is in my list of apps and it behaves exactly as an Android app because
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.440]   they've wrapped an Android.
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.440]   And where do you get it?
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.960]   I mean, how do you install it?
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:52.960]   Where does it come from?
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:53.960]   Does it website?
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.960]   You go to a website.
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:02.360]   If you use the website two or three times, it will also prompt you to open it.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:09.280]   Or if it's the right kind of website, it will give you when you do the say to desktop,
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:12.560]   it will go through this process instead.
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:15.080]   So what does Woodwind's website do now?
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.080]   Can I?
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.080]   Woodwind.xyz.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.080]   Okay.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:20.400]   Because I want to see this experience.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:24.200]   Now I'm on Windows running Chrome 60.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:27.720]   So Woodwind account is tied to your personal domain name.
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.240]   This is some sort of weird indie web thing, isn't it?
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:34.360]   You have to log in with your use your use with known.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.640]   Use your known site.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:43.520]   But you won't see the install dialog staff on Windows to the same extent.
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:52.240]   But it will work the moment you only get this on Firefox mobile and you get it on Chrome
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:54.640]   Android.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:59.800]   So what is new in 60?
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:03.520]   What is new in 60 is that it actually makes an APK from it.
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:09.600]   So before it would show up when you click the, yeah, it would show up in the list of apps
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.600]   that you scroll through.
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:14.600]   What's new is that it now also shows up in the app drawer as well.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.120]   So it feels more like an app.
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:20.240]   So this is kind of like those Chrome apps that we had that Google deprecated.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.240]   Yes.
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:23.960]   But it's a completely different loading experience.
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:24.960]   Okay.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:30.480]   So if you want another one, you can go to Jeremy's site.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:38.280]   Hang on.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.480]   What from a point of view of an end user, what's the value?
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:43.480]   Okay.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.080]   Now I'm finally authenticated.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:49.400]   It's, it's, it's, what wouldn't probably be the best one because it's, it requires a
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:50.400]   bunch of it.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:53.400]   You would have stuff to get going.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:58.560]   The value from the end user is that you start off using a website and it becomes an app
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.760]   transparent without you noticing what's going on.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:06.600]   But then it shows up, at least if you're on a mobile device shows up in your app drawer.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:09.800]   What does it look like on a desktop?
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:11.880]   It looks like an, an app icon on the desktop.
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:12.880]   Oh, interesting.
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:13.880]   Okay.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.880]   All right.
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:20.320]   Progressive web apps.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:23.120]   Now better than ever.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:25.480]   Are a lot of people embracing this technology?
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.480]   Yes.
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:30.200]   No, people, people are starting to see that this is, you know, particularly if you've
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:36.200]   got something that is very webbound and you don't want to set up a roadblock to people
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.920]   to install the app, that's a big problem.
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:41.880]   I could see why a newspaper instance might use this.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:47.080]   If I keep going to the Washington Post, eventually I have a Washington Post app kind of magically
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:51.120]   because Kevin, isn't that also, there's also at the same time there was progressive web
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.120]   apps and Android instant apps.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.920]   Yeah, that's, that's sometimes I confuse the two, but those are different.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:00.640]   So Android instant apps is to be able to pull a piece of an app out and server on the web.
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.880]   Progressive web app is a web page that has so much Internet of Acts like an app.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:04.880]   No?
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.880]   Is that the sub-less?
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:14.480]   So progressive web apps is, yeah, it's a web page that actually turns into an app.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:20.520]   So okay, another example, resilientwebdesign.com, which is Jeremy's book.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:24.160]   He made that into a progressive web app just because he could.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:29.160]   So if you go to that on Android and you can read the book and then it will offer to install
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:36.640]   it as a web app and then you get the little, you get the, you get it as an app shows up
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.200]   here.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:39.760]   That's really interesting.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:45.520]   And then if I click that resilience, it pops up and there's the book again.
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.760]   Oh, that's really cool.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.680]   So you can, you can do this.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:56.480]   You can, you can create a, you can create a web app around content that will then work
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:57.480]   when it's offline.
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:59.800]   But if I, you know, airplane mode this.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:00.800]   I do that all the time.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:06.360]   I think, oh, I want to download this site or I want to somehow capture this so I can continue.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:10.400]   Then this example of Jeremy's book, you know, I could easily see downloading the PDF so
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.520]   I could read it.
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.360]   So if I just go back to the site.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.000]   He's crashing all the pages now.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.920]   So, and that just does it the first time you visit or does it.
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:22.520]   I think it's like the second or third time you visit.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:25.320]   Oh, that's a great idea.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.320]   So, yeah.
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.320]   Do people mind?
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:29.200]   I mean, it's a seven megabyte download.
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.920]   Do they mind that I have the seven megabytes of this?
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:32.920]   Is it cash?
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:33.920]   Where does it store?
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:34.920]   It's a cashing thing.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.240]   So it's stored as a cash part of the browser.
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:38.240]   Okay.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:39.240]   Yeah.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:43.000]   You could probably abuse this a little and then, then the browser will start unloading
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000]   you.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000]   Right.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.480]   But, you know, for some, for textual content, there's no real pain from it.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:49.480]   Right.
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:50.480]   Neat.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:57.160]   But, but it's this subtle thing that's, this is like the end run of, of, of, of, of, of,
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:01.800]   like about three years worth of work to say, how can we make the web more app like,
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:04.360]   like we make this part of the experience.
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:05.960]   And it is now very, very smooth.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:10.520]   So if you're developing something that is primarily content like a web like, this is
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:13.920]   just going to make the experience smoother for many more people.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:18.280]   And, and another key thing is that it, you know, the offline stuff works better.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.520]   So really good use for safe, I'm thinking about us.
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.120]   If you came to our website, Twitter TV, a few times to download podcasts, it would
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:29.720]   just kind of automatically show up as an app in your, in your phone.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:30.720]   Yes.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:31.720]   Absolutely.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:34.440]   And then, and then how do users feel about that?
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.440]   Do they mind that?
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:40.640]   Well, they have to, they have to click a button and say, yes, add it.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:41.640]   Okay.
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:42.640]   Okay.
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:43.640]   So it, but it will brought them to do that.
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:45.640]   But it definitely eliminates that barrier.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.800]   And then when there's a new episode, you can make a notification conference in this new
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:51.800]   episode.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:52.800]   See, that's nice.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.880]   I like how hard is it to develop these?
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:56.880]   I like this.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.120]   It's not too bad.
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.960]   I mean, they're basically, they're basically developing a website.
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:07.240]   There's a manifest file you can add that describes what basically gives it an icon and
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:08.840]   says it go on the desktop.
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:13.600]   You have to have HTTPS and you have to create.
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.560]   Service workers.
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:21.800]   Service worker, a piece of code that will run to, to do this work of the caching and
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.800]   to handle the notification.
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:26.800]   So is it essentially a web view or is it something different?
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.120]   Um, it's, no, it's in a hard web app.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:33.360]   It's basically, it's a web page that has some extra powers.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.360]   Okay.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.800]   There's also am based, right?
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.800]   Oh, is it?
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:44.200]   No, it's kind of a thought to do out, but you can, it, it's complimentary.
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:48.720]   So you can, you know, the, the nice thing about AMP is that it gives you compact things
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:53.560]   that you can, you can run that will give you a standalone experience.
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:57.080]   And so if you could buy that the progressive web app, which is what that WAPO thing did
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:03.480]   when they still had it, it would give you a bunch of stories that were offline so that
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:05.160]   you could then read them on the subway or whatever.
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:09.120]   So there's, there's, there's a nice complementarity between the two, but there's a, but they're
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.400]   actually working in slightly different domains.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:16.880]   And then there's Facebook like bounce, which account for 16% of the average website's
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:17.880]   code.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:19.880]   That was amazing.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:20.880]   Really.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:21.880]   Yes.
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:25.880]   It's a lot of JavaScript, right?
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:27.880]   Fashion stuff.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:29.880]   Wow.
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:30.880]   But people want these features.
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:36.080]   That's why they put Facebook commenting on their web pages as they put like buttons.
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:39.040]   But you're any up down, losing a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:43.640]   Facebook's theory, you know, this is Facebook trying to be OS like, if you like.
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:47.400]   So they've got an SDK that includes all the things that are Facebook flavored stuff you
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:49.280]   can do.
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:54.360]   And the assumption is once you've been downloaded this once, you've got it for, for all the
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.520]   sites that are using it.
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:00.520]   So the, the pain of downloading isn't that high, but it does mean that you've still got
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:06.080]   to download it once wherever you are, but also you've still got to execute all this code
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.920]   and just doing that will take a bunch of time.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:12.560]   And that article is worth reading to see, you know, what the overhead of that is.
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:22.600]   It's like, it's like these, these apps, like I'm thinking of the Adam text editor, which
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:26.560]   you're basically, you're downloading Chrome, basically.
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.200]   Plus a bunch.
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:30.520]   You're basically, it's a browser.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:33.400]   You're downloading a bunch of JavaScript.
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:40.000]   So does that Facebook button work in AMP?
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.520]   Does the Facebook button work in AMP?
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:42.520]   I bet not.
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:47.040]   I mean, it's, it's, it's working because AMP really doesn't let you down that library,
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:51.160]   but I say Facebook wants to conform to the AMP pieces.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.160]   They can do it.
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:55.800]   So this will be one of these, like he says, you said things that I suspect won't actually
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:56.800]   have.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:59.040]   Well, I am also, no, AMP also sets the library, right?
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:02.920]   So AMP says, here's the library of things that are downloaded that every browser using
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:07.840]   AMP and does that or does not, it includes things like slideshows.
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.920]   Does it or it includes a tracker?
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:13.800]   Does it does it does it does it does it include Facebook stuff is a really interesting, kind
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:15.760]   of little anti-trusty thing going on there.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:19.040]   Well, it's a little, it's, it's one of those like you got to wrap your thing inside my
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:21.040]   thing to make it work.
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:23.120]   So I don't know yet.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:27.400]   I suspect Facebook will resist that because they prefer being that, you know, having had,
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:33.280]   I had previous here, Facebook will prefer to have their own thing and rely on the fact
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:37.760]   that they are, they have the ability to get it installed, which, you know, you, you probably
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:39.760]   have that installed.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:42.760]   You go to enough media sites, it'll be there.
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:47.320]   But what you'll find is that it's, it's, it's also running that code everywhere page
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:53.800]   you're viewing and that the overhead of that is high.
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:59.000]   If you drive around LA or New York, you might see these bill boards, big white billboard
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.560]   with just the simple text Netflix is a joke.
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:07.960]   Turns out they're bought by Netflix, of course.
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:12.400]   So I guess we'll find out what it, it's probably referring to some comedy series that Netflix
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:16.040]   is going to launch at some point.
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.040]   These guys know how to market.
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:23.240]   Maybe, I don't know, we'll find out.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:30.640]   Amy Schumer said she'd asked for and received money for Netflix for a stand up special after
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.280]   she said she wanted more money when she learned that Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle were each
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:37.280]   getting $20 million for their special.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:43.880]   Amy Schumer said, Hey, I want some of that Netflix money.
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.200]   Very subtle.
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:47.200]   Goodbye to Solaris.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.520]   The last bit of sun has finally gone out.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:51.520]   Is that what this?
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:52.520]   Oh, okay.
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:53.520]   Right.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:57.120]   Oracle has laid off and laid off all the Solaris tech staff.
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:04.720]   And this is, I think there's not much left of the sun acquisition at Oracle.
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:05.720]   Just mentioning it.
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:06.720]   It's amazing.
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.320]   Was it worth buying?
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:13.040]   Well, it turns out what, what I think this is widely agreed now that all Oracle really
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:16.240]   wanted, was the right to sue Google for billions of dollars.
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:17.240]   Yes.
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.440]   That hasn't worked out that well.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:26.240]   So apparently that was, I talked to Jonathan, was it Jonathan Schwartz or somebody who was
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:31.880]   at the meeting when Larry Ellison came to sun.
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:36.520]   And when he heard that bit about, well, you know, we haven't sued him, but we honestly
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:42.560]   feel like Google's infringing our requirements on Java.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:45.400]   Larry Ellison apparently rubbed his hands and glee.
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.600]   I wish I was a triangulation interview.
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:50.400]   I'm sure we'll find it at some point.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:51.400]   All right.
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.240]   Let's take a, let's take a little bit of a break because we still want some pics of the
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.880]   week and numbers of the week before we wrap this thing up.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.640]   Our show today brought to you by Kepterra.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:05.360]   Kepterra is a fabulous free and easy to use software directory.
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:09.200]   If you're looking for business software, I think a lot of people just probably Google
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.920]   it, but that's a terrible way to find a program that you'll be running your business on.
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:17.160]   You're just going to get a bunch of undifferentiated search results, what you really like is a
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:25.600]   directory with all of the possible programs, rated, reviewed, feature lists and all of that
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:26.600]   stuff.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:29.680]   And that's exactly what Kepterra does in 400 categories.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:35.320]   Looking for managing a church to a medical practice to e-commerce to CRM help desk, field
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:43.080]   service applicant tracking, development tools and on and on on 400 plus categories from
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:44.080]   A/B testing.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:50.680]   Let's go to the bottom of the alphabet all the way to, I think the last one is Q, R,
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:54.360]   S, T, yoga studio management.
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:57.640]   Let's say you have a yoga studio and you say, well, I want some software to run my yoga
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:58.640]   studio.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:04.720]   It turns out there's quite a few yoga studio programs that can run yoga studios.
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:06.200]   I mean lots.
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:07.760]   So let's narrow it down on the right.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:11.200]   You'll see we're going to only do four star ratings.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.400]   We're going to say 10 users.
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:14.400]   We want it web based.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:15.480]   Maybe you want it installed.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:18.760]   You get to pick, do you want staff management, online payments?
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:23.640]   Yes, member management, then filter the results and you'll narrow it down to the 11 products
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.600]   that do exactly what you want.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:29.760]   Then add them to a comparison chart, pick up to four of them.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:34.840]   Let's say these four right here and then we'll compare them now and look at this.
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:39.080]   You're going to get everything you need to know to help you find the right software,
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:43.400]   including the starting price, whether there's a free trial version where it's installed,
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:49.720]   how it runs, what features it has, screenshots, but the best part is the ratings and the reviews,
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:53.840]   the reviews from real users just like you.
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:50:00.800]   Kaptera has hundreds of thousands of software user reviews, all verified.
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.680]   This is just a fantastic site.
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:04.640]   Oh, did I mention?
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:07.600]   It's absolutely free.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:12.080]   No charge, no sign up, no salesman, who call.
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:16.720]   It's a service provided by Kaptera, absolutely free.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:19.320]   You won't get an annoying follow up emails or phone calls.
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:25.360]   You won't spend weeks or months searching because everything you need is right here.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:30.280]   C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A.com/TWIG.

[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:41.440]   Kaptera, and we thank Kaptera for their support of this week in Google.
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:45.080]   So Jeff Jarvis, let's start you up.
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:50.000]   I see you have a few things in here that I saved because I didn't want to steal your
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.360]   number, but you left out one of the numbers I was going to do.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:55.960]   You were happy with it.
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:51:03.720]   The amount of money Amazon spends on R&D, which exceeds every country, every company
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:07.720]   in the world, $16.1 billion.
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:12.880]   Alfa-bet 13 Intel 12 Microsoft.
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:14.240]   The tech companies lead.
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.480]   They're the red bars on this graph.
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:22.640]   The highest non-tech company is number six, Johnson & Johnson General Motors Pfizer Ford.
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:23.640]   But look at that.
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:24.640]   Amazon.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:27.400]   So this is Amazon not making a profit.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:29.560]   This is where the investment goes.
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:32.160]   R&D, and it pays off.
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:33.160]   Amazing.
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:34.600]   $16 billion.
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:38.960]   Nobody comes even close.
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:42.200]   So I wasn't going to mention that because I thought, "Oh, that'll be Jeff's numbers
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:45.680]   for sure, but you got some other ones."
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.680]   Oh, we got some other ones.
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:55.000]   We got Google and Udacity are providing 75,000 scholarships for coding and data.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.000]   Oh, nice.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.960]   My daughter is taking a Udacity course on artificial intelligence.
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:00.960]   She wants to know.
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:03.120]   Jake finished one on App Development.
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:04.440]   Isn't it great?
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:06.080]   I just want to...
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:08.200]   It's such a good thing.
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:09.200]   This was a good job.
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:10.880]   A Googler started this, right?
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.720]   Google X guy, I remember.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:15.120]   A Sebastian Throner.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:16.120]   No.
[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:17.120]   Was it Throner?
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:18.120]   I think so, yeah.
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:19.120]   Yeah, I think it was.
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:20.120]   Yeah, he started...
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:22.880]   And they have these nano degrees which you pay for.
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:25.280]   Some free and some paid.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:30.760]   The nano degrees, you can get a new career, a new job, which in this way this day matters.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:37.840]   So that's one, the other one just for our amusement is the top 20 how-to searches in 2017
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:38.840]   in Google.
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:39.840]   Okay.
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:42.960]   I guess it's how many.
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:45.800]   How to tie a tie is number one.
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:46.800]   How to tie a tie.
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:48.840]   Oh, but it gets weirder.
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:50.560]   How to kiss, really?
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:57.440]   Number three, if you have to ask Google how to get pregnant, more people want to know
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.920]   how to get pregnant than how to lose weight.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:02.160]   How to make money.
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:04.880]   How to make pancakes.
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.120]   How to write a cover letter.
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.320]   How to make French toast.
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:08.640]   How to lose belly fat.
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:10.000]   No one's searching for that.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.320]   Come on.
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:12.520]   How to write a resume.
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.520]   How to boil eggs.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:14.520]   How to draw...
[01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:15.520]   Boil eggs?
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.520]   Boil eggs.
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:19.880]   No, I look up hard boiling eggs all the time because there's a magic method that I can never
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:21.120]   remember.
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:24.560]   So I do search for that a lot, but I know how to do it roughly, but I just need to have
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:27.000]   the details.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.760]   How to get rid of acne.
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:31.000]   Oh, number 18.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.840]   How to love.
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:36.960]   I want to know how to love.
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:37.960]   This number...
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:38.960]   Know what...
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:40.960]   How to hate is not on the list.
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:42.480]   How to love.
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:45.600]   How to get rid of fruit flies, very popular.
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:50.560]   So Simon Rogers, who's Google's data editor, a friend of mine, says that how two searches
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:54.640]   have increased 140% since 2004.
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:58.160]   You know, everybody I know learns how to do stuff on YouTube.
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:53:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:01.320]   My son has basically learned how to cook on YouTube.
[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:02.320]   Wow.
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.320]   He says everything is on YouTube.
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:07.200]   He cooks a lot of hot dogs.
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.520]   No, actually, when I get my sous...
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:10.520]   Eggs.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:15.280]   When I get my sous vide machine, I learned everything on YouTube.
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:16.280]   It's amazing.
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:17.640]   YouTube is the best...
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:22.920]   I would guess that more education going on on YouTube than anywhere.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:25.800]   Kevin has returned to us.
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:29.240]   He was trying to jog around the house.
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:30.840]   I had to let the dogs out.
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:31.840]   Okay.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:32.840]   So they'll be...
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:33.840]   Who let the dogs out?
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:34.840]   That's the answer.
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:35.840]   Kevin...
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:38.840]   You can probably hear a dog drinking water in the background.
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:39.840]   I do.
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:43.440]   So Kevin, I know you'll want to say something about the indie web or the homebrew website
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:45.240]   club or something like that.
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:46.440]   Oh, yes.
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:50.080]   Well, there's a homebrew website club tonight.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.400]   It's in...
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:59.760]   You've already missed London and Brighton, but we have San Francisco and Baltimore.
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:02.840]   And new tonight, we have Austin.
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:03.840]   It's just starting tonight.
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:04.840]   So go along...
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:10.680]   If you're in Austin tonight, go along there half our six at Monkey Nest Coffee.
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:13.840]   On Burnett Road down there in beautiful Austin, Texas.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:14.840]   Yes.
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:15.840]   There's...
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:18.200]   It's a coffee shop, Monkey Nest.
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:21.400]   And I see Mozilla's going to have one and...
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:22.400]   Yes.
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:29.640]   Manton will be at the Austin one who does a micro-ed upload.
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:31.840]   And Tantag will be at the Mozilla one.
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:32.800]   Yes.
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:33.800]   That's right.
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:34.800]   Nice.
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:37.360]   homebrew website.
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:42.960]   And there is also a indie web camp this weekend in Dortmund in Germany.
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:43.960]   Ooh.
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:45.960]   That looks like...
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:47.640]   That's part of the camper festival.
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:51.600]   And they try to bring a lot of journalists to that one so that you should tell your friends,
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.760]   Jeff, because I may have all of German journalists friends.
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:54.760]   Ah, yes.
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:59.200]   Well, we are all about the indie web and open web.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:03.560]   So thank you for the good work you do to promote that.
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:06.120]   I want to give a big plug to my new...
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:07.520]   Oh, what we're thinking to shake.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:08.520]   Have you seen this?
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:09.520]   No.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:10.520]   What?
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:12.360]   You must go offline to view this page.
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:14.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:15.960]   Show...
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:16.960]   Show...
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:19.200]   That says "Enable Airplane Mode."
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:21.160]   That's a website.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.160]   It's a website.
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.800]   It's using the progressive web app features.
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:28.400]   And now I'm in a phone mode.
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:29.400]   Oh, my God.
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:30.400]   That's all.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.400]   Who is the page?
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:32.400]   So that's a...
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.400]   So basically...
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:37.960]   Great demonstration of progressive web apps.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:41.480]   And part of the point of the progressive web app stuff is you can detect when you're
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.720]   offline and you can give them some content.
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:47.080]   You've already cached or you can give them a page saying, "Sorry, we're offline.
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:48.080]   Come online again."
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.880]   But this guy said, "Well, this is Chris Boland."
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:56.720]   And so presumably when I'm on this first page, it's now caching the rest of it.
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:57.720]   Right.
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:00.760]   So you can search the offline page and then when you go offline, it will appear.
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:01.760]   Oops.
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:02.760]   I'm just going to play in the middle again.
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:03.760]   That's my family.
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:04.760]   That's my family.
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:05.760]   I'd be kind of fun.
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:06.760]   Let me see if I can...
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:07.760]   You could do this on a desktop, I guess, huh?
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:10.080]   I think they just start working the same way, but just try and see.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:11.080]   All right.
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:13.360]   I'm trying to figure out how I go offline on this machine.
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:15.680]   That's the challenge on the desktop.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:18.240]   Well, I know there should be...
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:20.880]   There should be a little Wi-Fi thing here somewhere.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:22.840]   I don't see it though.
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:23.840]   Is this...
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.520]   You running Cremor Windows?
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:27.520]   Windows.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:28.520]   I'll just do that.
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:29.960]   Oh, there's definitely a way to do it.
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:31.760]   I just, for some reason, don't see it.
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:33.160]   That's not a case.
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:34.400]   Let's go into airplane mode.
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:35.800]   I am now in airplane mode.
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:39.640]   Let's return to my page.
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:41.560]   I've lost everything.
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:42.560]   Nothing.
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:43.560]   Come on.
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:44.560]   I'm offline.
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:46.920]   Do I have to refresh?
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:47.920]   Maybe.
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:49.960]   You're on Crem, right?
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:52.360]   Yeah, it's Windows is the problem.
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:54.040]   I'll forget it.
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:55.040]   Take...
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.040]   Do this on your phone.
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:58.040]   I lost my mouse now.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:01.560]   You found out I'm just having a bad day.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:02.960]   It just sucks.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:04.960]   You clean those black.
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:07.080]   You crashed my computer.
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:08.080]   All right.
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:12.160]   Well, I can't show my pick of the week, but I will be demonstrating it.
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:17.100]   And if I don't crash it between now and Saturday on the new screensavers, I have the worst
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:18.100]   luck with drones.
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:21.320]   I see all these beautiful drone videos people are taking.
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:23.800]   And finally, Alex Lindsey convinced me, "No, no.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:24.800]   You can fly this drone."
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:26.000]   I've heard this before, by the way.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.200]   The first drone I ever got.
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:31.760]   I was told by our drone expert, Father Robert Ballisare, we call him the...
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.760]   What do we call them?
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:34.760]   The what?
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:36.000]   The quad father.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:36.840]   The quad father.
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:39.360]   We call him the quad father.
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.360]   That's good.
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:42.360]   He's a quadcopter expert.
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:44.960]   He said, "Get a cheap one because you'll crash it right away."
[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:45.960]   So I got a $40 drone.
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:49.360]   He used it once, turned it on, said, "Go up."
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:51.480]   I started going up and said, "Come down.
[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:52.480]   Come down."
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:54.400]   It just went up like a balloon and never came back.
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:55.640]   I don't know where it ended up.
[01:58:55.640 --> 01:58:57.760]   I lost sight of it.
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:00.520]   So that's $40 down the tube.
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:07.360]   Next one I bought, $500 bebop drone that everybody said, "You can't crash this."
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:09.480]   First thing I did, crashed it.
[01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:15.280]   And it's ever since I still have it, when you launch it, it falls over like this.
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:18.480]   So I really wasn't that excited about getting another drone.
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:22.680]   But then I thought, "Well, it'd be fun because I'm going to be going on a Caribbean sale
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:25.840]   with my son and he wants to make a video and all that."
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:28.560]   And I said, "It'd all be great if we have a drone fly over there."
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:32.120]   So Alex Lindsey convinced me, "You could pull up the ... It's from DJI.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:34.560]   It's called the Mavic Pro.
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:35.560]   You fold it up.
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:36.560]   You can carry it.
[01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:37.560]   It's tiny.
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:40.440]   I mean, it's not a tiny drone, but when you fold it up, it's not big.
[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:44.560]   It's like the size of a computer power supply sort of.
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:50.680]   Little expensive, but man, what I learned is we are really in a whole new era of drones.
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:53.160]   These things are so much better than the early drones.
[01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:54.160]   They do so many things.
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:55.520]   This has all these follow modes.
[01:59:55.520 --> 02:00:00.480]   You can set it to recognize you or a person that will continue to follow you as you ski
[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:02.480]   or run or sail.
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:05.400]   It can recognize a boat and continue to follow the boat.
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:08.680]   It can rotate around it, keeping its eye on you.
[02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:12.040]   It can follow you in a profile.
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:15.400]   Anyway, I've already flown it a few times.
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:17.480]   Haven't crashed it, which is a good sign.
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:23.920]   Not good, because it's expensive to crash it.
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:26.120]   The 4K video looks stunning that I got back.
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:30.000]   I would show you, but I'm basically offline at this point.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.120]   I don't know when I came back online.
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:34.960]   But you'll see more Adu, a full review.
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:37.920]   In fact, we'll fly it on the new screensabers on Saturday.
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:38.920]   I'm very impressed.
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:39.920]   The Mavic Pro.
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:40.920]   This is DJI.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.480]   It's on a camera.
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:44.320]   It's on a gimbal.
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:46.080]   It works with a smartphone.
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:47.080]   You can plug it in.
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:48.080]   They even have seen that.
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:50.080]   They have a VR helmet you can wear if you want to.
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:51.080]   How much?
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:52.080]   1,000.
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:53.080]   Not too bad.
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:56.320]   You're riding an airplane for a second.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.120]   The main amount of technology in this thing blows me away.
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:06.240]   I know it sounds like a lot, but this has got a lot more technology than a $1,000 smartphone.
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:09.320]   I mean, it's kind of mind boggling.
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:11.560]   It flies for half an hour.
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:13.360]   It can go 12 miles away.
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:15.760]   I've heard about four miles away from you.
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:16.760]   It has auto.
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:17.760]   It has GPS built in.
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:22.800]   If you do get loose track of it, this is, I really need this, it will just come home.
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:26.000]   Or there's a home button you can press and it will come back to where it took off from
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000]   and land.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000]   I did try that.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.880]   First thing I did, I said, "Well, will it really do that?"
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:31.640]   I'll find my phone for a drone.
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:32.640]   I'll take it.
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:33.640]   Yeah.
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:37.760]   I've lost so many that it's just that feature alone seems worth it to me.
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:38.760]   It will come back.
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:39.760]   I think you can buy the two.
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:42.480]   You can find my phone and the drone goes and gets your phone and brings you back to you.
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:47.680]   The good thing, DJI for 99 bucks has a fixed your drone plan that if you do fly into a
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:52.120]   tree or it gets wet or whatever, you've been exit back to them and they'll fix it and
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:53.120]   send it back to you.
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:54.120]   I bought the insurance.
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:57.680]   How much is the insurance?
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:01:58.680]   99 bucks.
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:02.840]   It was worth it, believe me, after losing zero deductible.
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:04.080]   I didn't even inquire.
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:06.280]   I just knew I needed it.
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:07.960]   I'm sure, I don't know.
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:08.960]   That's a good question.
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:12.720]   I'll let you know the minute I use it because I'm sure I will be.
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:14.160]   But review on Saturday.
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:17.080]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.080]   Thank you, Kevin Marks, for filling in for Stacy.
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:20.080]   Always a pleasure.
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:22.960]   Find him at dgweb.org at Kevin Marks.
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:28.480]   I love doing this show because I get to be around really smart people and learn stuff.
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:33.000]   Smart people like you, Kevin, and like you, Jeff Jarvis, Professor of Journalism at CUNY,
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.840]   Blogger@buzzmachine.com at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter.
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:44.000]   He told me that on Twitter, I feel like I don't want to ignore trolls and racism.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.520]   You said, "No, you have to fight racism wherever..."
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:48.840]   Because if we're in person, I'd say something.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:50.840]   But I feel like on Twitter, it's like...
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:55.040]   I think we have to start to expect civility from others.
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:56.040]   Yeah.
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:57.040]   When we demand it.
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:58.040]   Well, when we demand it.
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:00.280]   When we don't, we're somewhat called bull.
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:04.440]   When we encourage the incivility, when we say, "Fight, fight, go on that funny."
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:07.240]   We're equally guilty.
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:09.040]   No, I like it.
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:15.480]   Let's bring civil discourse back to the commons.
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:18.640]   Stacy, we'll be back next week, I think.
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:19.640]   Yes.
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:21.840]   Jeff, you traveling or can you come back next week?
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:22.840]   I think I'm here.
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:23.840]   I owe Carson the list.
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:25.240]   I think I'm going one time this month.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:28.520]   Kevin will have you back very soon.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:29.520]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:34.000]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday afternoon, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2030
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000]   UTC.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.760]   If you want to watch live, go to twit.tv/live.
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:42.120]   And if you do watch live, you should also be in the chatroom at IRC. twit.tv.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:44.480]   Join those crazy kids in the back of the class.
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:46.160]   Throw in the spitballs.
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:47.760]   They're actually a huge help to us.
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:49.520]   And it's always fun to have them.
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:53.120]   If you want to be in studio live, we often have studio audiences for the shows.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.480]   All you have to do is email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:00.360]   We'd be glad to get a seat and you can come and join us and watch the fun.
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:02.840]   But I know most of you have other things to do in life.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:06.720]   So we make on-demand versions of everything we do available at our website.
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:12.800]   In this case, twit.tv/twig or use your favorite podcast application pocket, cast, stitch,
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:15.960]   or slacker iTunes overcast.
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:16.960]   And subscribe.
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:20.000]   That way you'll get every single episode.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000]   Thanks for joining us this week.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.200]   We'll see you next time on this week.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:23.720]   Bye-bye.
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:26.300]   (upbeat music)
[02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:28.880]   (upbeat music)
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:31.460]   (upbeat music)
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:33.800]   (soft music)
