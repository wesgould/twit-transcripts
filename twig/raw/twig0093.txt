[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.800]   She's actually in the Brooklyn.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.760]   I'm in the Brooklyn.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.160]   Howdy, howdy.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.920]   Howdy, howdy.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.280]   Out there for a think up--
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.840]   How you doing?
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.320]   Think up stuff.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.280]   How you doing?
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.760]   How you doing?
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.760]   How you doing?
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.760]   How you doing?
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.760]   Yeah, I'm out in town meeting up with expert labs.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.760]   Yeah, how you doing?
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.760]   How you doing?
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.360]   Did you ever have an accent?
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.160]   Give me this one.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.160]   What else?
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.040]   Did you talk like that?
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.040]   I did.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.440]   And I worked really hard in college to get rid of it.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.680]   And now it comes out when I'm very angry or very passionate.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.640]   So I'm sure you'll hear it at some point.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.880]   The passionate thing is funny.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.920]   I think I broke out, yeah.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.960]   That's like a scene for a movie.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.560]   You know she loves me when she starts sounding like that.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.680]   Oh, baby, baby.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.680]   I'm doing--
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.680]   What are you talking about?
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.680]   What are you talking about?
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.680]   What are you talking about?
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.560]   Like that's a typical thing I'll come out.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.240]   What are you talking about?
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.920]   Can you do the whole thing in Brooklyn today?
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.120]   It's the thing.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.360]   I can't do it on demand.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.040]   It just becomes-- it's like this primitive.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.840]   It's like the id.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.520]   It's this early version of myself.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.120]   Before I went to college and decided it didn't sound educated.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.960]   And I tried to--
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.080]   Oh, so educated now.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.840]   Yeah, she's so small.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.600]   It keeps me New York.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.400]   It'll do it to you.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.920]   Scroll about that Brooklyn accent.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.320]   I don't know, really?
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.400]   Also here you probably noticed Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.560]   He is a professor of journalism at the city
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.200]   of University of New York.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.120]   And Bob blogs at buzzmachine.com, the author of What
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.840]   Would Google Do?
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.080]   I had one of your former students, Karina, in here.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   Karina?
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.960]   Yeah, she took a-- you told her, don't-- whatever you do,
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   don't take a job at a newspaper.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.000]   So she took a job with patch.com, which
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.080]   is AOL's kind of hyper local news.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.560]   Right.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.520]   Is she covering the town?
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.240]   She covers Petaluma at Petaluma.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.740]   Cool.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.720]   I'm just running an article about me.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.480]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.920]   I think it was really cool to see her.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.280]   And hear that she was a Jarvis site.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.360]   A unique, radical journalism.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.640]   There's a sign behind me, yes.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.140]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.880]   So I guess the big story of the week, the year,
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.960]   probably the decade is the Osama bin Laden site--
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.520]   or assassination, I should say.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.120]   But the interesting thing, of course,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.800]   is all of the Google stuff.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.400]   I immediately, actually, when it happened,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.840]   went to Google Maps, and somebody had marked his compound.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.560]   And people have been ever since have been reviewing
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.000]   his compound with nasty reviews.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.120]   But there's actually some genuine value here to it,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.920]   because a Google Earth has also been loddenized.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.000]   And people are doing 3D sketch up renderings
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.040]   of the compound that are, I think, fairly accurate,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.760]   that you could see on Google Maps,
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.600]   I'm like, for sale, open house.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.560]   The instant shtick, the joking, the analysis,
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.400]   the interaction that happened that night,
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.440]   I mean, it was amazing on Twitter and everywhere.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.960]   I mean, the fact that by the time you got to where
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.440]   you thought the compound was on maps,
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.880]   it had already been marked.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.240]   That's amazing.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.200]   I mean, it's like, it's Wikipedia, except it's everywhere.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.480]   For me, I was on Twitter most of the time.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.080]   You're waiting for the president to speak
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.000]   for a good hour or so.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.120]   He was pretty late.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.160]   I would say all of us learned that the president's security
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.680]   speech, which was to come an hour or so later,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.280]   was most likely going to be that they had got been lodden
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.840]   from Twitter.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.360]   Well, Mashable did a survey in cooperation with USA Today.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.240]   So it's one of those unscientific surveys,
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.080]   both because it's USA Today and because it's
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.880]   Mashable audience.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.560]   But as I remember the numbers, 14% of that audience
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.200]   learned about it on TV, 18% on Facebook,
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.320]   and Twitter was 43%.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.560]   Interesting.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.320]   It says a lot.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.080]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.480]   That audience is super skewed.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.920]   But it says it's, yeah, it is.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.480]   But it says it's possible.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.560]   And you know, when struck me, I had a reporter from Reuters
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.880]   ping me and ask if this was a defining moment for Twitter.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.640]   And I thought, well, OK, you know,
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.640]   the 20th another one.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.880]   You know, every day is a dude defining moment for Twitter.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.400]   Right.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.840]   But as I thought about it, trying to, you know,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.800]   say something quotable, which is what I do,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   you know, I realized that I was watching Twitter in the foreground,
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.360]   and TV was on in the background.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.880]   Oh, that's a big deal.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.400]   Yes.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.480]   And TV just repeats a piece of pieces.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.720]   The other thing that really struck me
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.160]   is because they were starting to show the scenes from the White
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.560]   House, and then later, of course, ground zero and Times
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.360]   Square.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.280]   And I said my quote to her that I then retweeted,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.120]   because he only had so many good lines,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.240]   is that Twitter was the Times Square of this victory day.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.400]   Oh, that's good.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.840]   We all wanted to go and be with people.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.160]   And that's what we did on Twitter.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.280]   Instead of kissing a nurse in Times Square,
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.040]   I went to Osama's compound.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.840]   Now there's a bunch of darts in here and a lot of reviews.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.840]   There was only one when I first went there.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.040]   You know, being here in New York, my first instinct
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.400]   was I want to get on the train and go to ground zero right now.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   Oh, I bet.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.600]   I mean, it wasn't until my boss, Anil,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.000]   who's a much more reasonable and thoughtful person than I am,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   when he started to say, I mean, the conversation about the way
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.920]   that people were reacting, I mean, this was just happening
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.760]   at light speed, versus the death certificate,
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.400]   birth certificate jokes happened before Obama,
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.600]   you know, was even near making the announcement.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.920]   And then, you know, this like, I want to go there and be with people.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.160]   I'm going to get silly string and like, throw the beach balls around,
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.520]   too.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.360]   It's like, oh, maybe that isn't the, you know, the appropriate response.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.440]   What is the appropriate response?
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.120]   How do I feel?
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.400]   I mean, it was just, it happened so quickly.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.960]   It's a small span of time.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.840]   I was thinking about, I was thinking about, you know,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.800]   I was here in New York on September 11th.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.920]   I know you were to Jeff and I know you wrote about it
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.800]   and you tweeted about where you were standing at.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.960]   I thought about that day and I thought about what,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.240]   how would that day have been different if there had been Twitter?
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.320]   It would have been so different.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.440]   I mean, I would have felt a sense of connection.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.040]   I remember there just a sense of panic and loneliness.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.720]   Like, I'm not going to be able to get back across the river to my family
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.840]   because the phones are jammed that I can't even call my wife or call my mom.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.080]   Like, it was this disconnection.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.480]   But, you know, if Twitter had been working, although I don't know if data
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.720]   connections would have been working either, it would have been a different
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.240]   experience.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.200]   So, well, as soon as to Twitter might have been working, you know, it was.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.760]   And I think that people would have had a very different view of the event.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.960]   People witnessed the event from rooftops three miles away.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.720]   It was smoke going up.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.200]   And that's where I was.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.320]   You know, the scenes that I say, it was since that day, I, I missed these
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.840]   scenes that are seared in my brain, many of which I don't want to recall,
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.240]   but some that are amazing and I had no camera.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.240]   And I started carrying the camera in my bag every day since then, of course,
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.760]   now I'm listening to you.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.000]   And so, you know, what would have been recorded and seen, you know, there was
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.320]   this wonderful project called, I think it was called Here's New York.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.920]   There was a collection of photos that were from there.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.080]   That is a giant book and it's magnificent.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.760]   And I, I obsessed about the photos, trying to, because it was just so odd.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.960]   What was happening?
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.120]   For those who don't know, I was a, I was in the last train into the World's
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.840]   Crates Center.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.200]   I stayed around like an idiot as a journalist, which is synonymous.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.400]   And I was a block away from the South Tower when it came down.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.320]   So I was one of those guys who was, you know, covered in stuff, covered in
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   the, yeah.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.040]   And it's such a surreal, strange thing that you had to kind of remind
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.320]   yourself what this was like.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:47.240]   And so if there had been thousands of cameras there, live, telling the world
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.080]   what was happening there, it would have been terribly, terribly different.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.680]   Yep.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.320]   And that's why I started blogging.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.120]   Really?
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.520]   It's like, I came here.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.160]   Really?
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.520]   Because everything had changed.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.840]   Everything had changed.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.880]   The city had changed.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.000]   You changed everything changed.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.440]   So after that, I was like, I became obsessed with writing everything down
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.160]   because, because I have to remember it, you know, and just, you know, the, I
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.440]   mean, the whole experience was just, and that's when I start, yeah, that's
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.120]   when I started blogging.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.520]   I started my personal blog in a month or two later.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.360]   And Jeff, you started blogging because of my life.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.080]   I started to age later because I had more to say, I wrote a story.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.320]   If you, if you go to my blog, there's a post high up that has the link to the
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.080]   story that I wrote.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.640]   And then I had more to say the next day.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.680]   I thought honestly, I was going to blog for a few days, a few weeks just to get
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.320]   it out of my system, right?
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.760]   That it, you know, little did I know it changed my view of media, my career and
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.240]   my life.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.600]   And all of that was out of, out of 9/11.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.680]   And there's also a link there to the audio that I recorded from, from the day
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.560]   that, that I was there.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:52.520]   And the original blog was titled, war log, World War three, which was, you know,
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.040]   kind of rather of the time.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.600]   And I was part of one of the original war bloggers.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.680]   Wow.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.440]   That's the story.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.040]   And yes, we'll all tell you that's, you're, you're right.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.380]   You know, it, it, it, it, bin Laden's killing just, just for me, I'd
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.560]   say for you, it just went full circle and brought out all these memories and
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.600]   all these visions and emotions.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:15.940]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.600]   I mean, I was really happy, but then it was like, you know, I lost a family
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.760]   friend and, you know, he's still gone.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.840]   And now bin Laden's got, you know, it doesn't bring anybody back.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.600]   It's just someone else.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.240]   Yeah, it was, it was lots of, well, whatever.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.680]   I don't mean this to turn into a therapy session, but it was very complex as it
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.520]   was for everybody.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.800]   And the other thing about Twitter too, I think was, was fascinating to me was
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.360]   that, you know, I wanted to know what was happening at the World Trade Center.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.280]   I want, I wanted to go there.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.560]   My heart was there and I, and I, you know, couldn't have more, far more important
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.960]   was taking my daughter to school the next day.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:47.760]   And, uh, but Matt Bishop, who's the New York bureau chief for the economist,
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.440]   uh, said, I'm going to go to the trade.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.440]   So, you know, I said pictures and he sent pictures and he sent pictures and it
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.640]   was so great to have that.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.160]   And of course, the great story out of all this was the, was the technician, you
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.120]   know, an old news now with the technician in Alba de Bad, who,
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.120]   tweeted the event.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.160]   Yeah, that was amazing.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.720]   Got hacked after that.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.840]   We did.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.640]   I didn't know that part of it.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.760]   Well, he, you know, his blog got a lot of traffic.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.920]   So he was sitting, I guess, sitting in a coffee shop and he said, there's
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.400]   helicopters, uh, flying over.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.760]   Uh, I wish I had my big swatter to fly it, swatted away.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.080]   And then he said, Oh, there was a big boom.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.760]   I hope this doesn't, uh, per seage something horrible happening.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.760]   Uh, he actually, yeah, he basically live tweeted it, not knowing at any point
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.040]   what it was till the next day.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.200]   Which just says you can't keep anything secret.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.520]   No kidding.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.360]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.680]   No kidding.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.480]   I'm on the power.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.120]   So I may cut out any moment.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.400]   Okay.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.640]   So if Gina loses her Skype connection to us, she'll just phone in.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.480]   We'll call in.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.560]   She'll sound like she's on the phone, but other than that, she'll
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.760]   still be your same scintillating self.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.240]   But I mean, it really, it's funny how 10 years has been a, a such a huge shift
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.720]   from the CNN era to the, the, is it the Twitter era?
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.200]   Is it the social media?
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.280]   Life was just part of it.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.040]   Right.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.400]   But, but yeah, I think that it, it, it changes the whole thing.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   You know, the other thing that, that I've been saying lately, I don't
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.800]   want to say it on the show yet is that after watching a Larry
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.920]   Elastic video recently that he talked about how the architecture of the
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.840]   web is something we don't take a pay enough attention to it.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.920]   I realized that in Twitter news is now mimicking finally the architecture
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.320]   of the internet.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.760]   It's going end to end that, that, that the witness over here and the
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.680]   world over here can talk to each other.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.600]   The journalist doesn't need to be there anymore.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.080]   Can be, can add value.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.040]   Well, that would be my, my question about it all.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.880]   Does it, is there an advantage?
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.520]   What do we gain?
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.760]   Do we gain a better understanding of it?
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.200]   I mean, certainly more immediate.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.880]   We gain witnesses.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.000]   We gain perspective.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.960]   We gain questions.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.720]   We gain nut jobs managed, you know, to push their, their death or BS around.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.800]   Luckily on Twitter, you can unfollow it.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.000]   Yeah, I think we gain mainly the witnesses.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.120]   That's what we gain.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.000]   Now there were no witnesses to this event, but you gain witnesses who were in, you
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.720]   know, at the World Trade Center and things like that.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.480]   And that has value.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.200]   And background and context, I found myself reading the bin Laden obituary that
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.280]   the Times published.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.120]   Like I went to the time, I mean, I was on Twitter and listening to all the
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.000]   crack, you know, all the jokes and all the, you know, feelings and all that stuff.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.280]   But then I went to the Times and was like, I want to read the story.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.080]   I want to, you know, I watched the president and I read that obituary.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.560]   I learned things that I didn't know about him.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.560]   It just, you know, I think there's, there's, there's context and depth.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.840]   I think that you get.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.480]   Yeah, but you still go to the main, the mainstream media sources for reporting
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.720]   and factual information, vetted information, but you get it, but the, but
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.440]   the colors are filled in by the social media.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.520]   Yeah, it's the place we can talk about it.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.640]   And yeah, and reaction and right.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.480]   I mean, the key was that, you know, the grand national experiences we had before
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.600]   really amounted to us all happening to watch the same show at the same time.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.120]   Right.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.040]   Like Kennedy is killed and we're all watching.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.480]   We're all watching Cronkite announce it.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.440]   Right.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.680]   And, and that, that passed people mourn the passing of that and say that we
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.120]   don't have that thing that brings us together.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.280]   Well, we have things that bring us together in far better ways now.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:04.720]   Right.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.240]   Uh, of course it was the largest sustained throughput on Twitter, not the largest
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.520]   single, uh, uh, tweets per second.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.400]   That goes to the Japanese New Year of all things.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:21.080]   Uh, but the largest sustained tweets per second over a period of an hour
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:26.080]   or so, and Google says they saw a 1 million in percent increase in searches
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.880]   for bin Laden.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.600]   So that's interesting too.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.000]   It means that we not only go to Twitter and the New York Times, but we then do.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.960]   Search is, are we looking for current stories?
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.600]   Are we looking to research bin Laden or are we looking for pictures?
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.480]   What are we looking for?
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:48.000]   Um, between, and this is between seven 30 and eight 30 PM.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.520]   So that was when the news broke over Twitter.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.920]   So what that is is people saying here, oh, I know what it is.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.360]   They read the tweet and they go, what?
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.560]   And they are, and they're going to Google to find the news story.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.400]   So that does valid universal search has it.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:02.760]   Right.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.080]   That's good.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.960]   They know, they know news is going to be part of search now.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.760]   They've, and that validates, uh, the fact that we still want to go back to a
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.920]   mainstream source.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.360]   That's actually a good sign because it is, it is, you know, you want to hear it on
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:14.640]   Twitter.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.320]   It doesn't mean it's true.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.360]   So you want to validate it.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.760]   It is a very different experience that we have, but I, I, the reason I asked that
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:29.160]   questions is because I wonder if there's a, if it's a substantive change or if it's
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.800]   just, well, now we have this additional stuff.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.880]   Does it really add to our understanding of an event?
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.200]   It certainly has to the, the color of it.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.640]   But it is a, I think so.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.440]   I absolutely do think so.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.080]   But again, it's the difference is whether it's an event in which the witnesses
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.840]   add a lot.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.280]   Yeah, there were no witnesses.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.240]   You know, if the Navy seals were tweeting, right?
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.560]   Yeah, I mean, never happened.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.360]   That's not going to happen.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.240]   I don't think Navy seals.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.520]   But I think, I think Gina's right too.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.480]   I think you start to get a sense of the mood about this.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:04.840]   You know, I was surprised when it didn't register with me when people started showing up
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:10.280]   at the White House Gates chanting USA, USA and being happy.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.560]   And you know, I got it pretty quickly.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.200]   I'm not stupid, but, but that was not my reflex.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.680]   It was kind of like, oh, well, at last.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.440]   And, you know, I feel a little bad for myself, but I'm no longer a pacifist.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.040]   And, but that's the reason why.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.960]   And being able to talk to other people and react to it, I think Gina's right that, you know,
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.040]   getting that color of the country's mood is something you could not have gotten before.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.800]   You also get made up quotes from Martin Luther King and others.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.320]   Well, right.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.400]   That's just a natural human urge.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.520]   I was guilty of receiving that.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.720]   Did you retweet the M.K.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.920]   I retweeted.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.680]   Yeah, I retweeted the twain quote.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.200]   Was it twain quote made up as well?
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.360]   Yeah, I believe so.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.440]   They were just a little too, uh, a little too right on.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.440]   You know, when I, it was funny because I initially felt triumph and saw people showing up at the
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.760]   gate and I thought, wow, I'm feeling more patriotic than I felt in, you know, in a really long time.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.680]   And then I started to see people on Twitter question celebrating a death like that.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.800]   And then, and I started to sort of realign and be like, that's true.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.160]   Do I, you know, do I want to celebrate that?
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.440]   I have mixed feelings about this.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.400]   It's not just triumph.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:21.000]   So it helped me, certainly it helped me work through the thought process a little sooner because I was
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.240]   listening to lots of different people talk about their reactions and, and, you know,
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.080]   otherwise I would have just been watching TV and seen thousands of people chanting USA,
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:34.040]   you know, who would have been in diapers, you know, 10 years ago or 10 years old, 10 years ago.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.920]   Megan McCartill writing for the Atlantic did the, I guess she did the original research that said,
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.600]   no, Martin Luther King never said that, but she pointed out, and I think this is really true,
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.320]   it was a way for whoever created that fabricated that quote is a way for them to say something
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:54.360]   that they didn't feel safe to say with their own words, which is, you know, I mourn the loss of
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:00.120]   thousands of precious lives, but it's, you know, hard to mourn a single person or hard to celebrate a
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.400]   single person's death. And that's kind of politically incorrect to say at a moment like that.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.680]   Let me get the quote exactly right.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.920]   I'm mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one,
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.800]   not even an enemy. So you're trying hard to get the quote right where the quote is right.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.760]   I know the fake quote. Let me get the fake quote right. But she makes this point, which is
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:26.680]   that it was a way for somebody to say something that was otherwise hard to say. So, you know,
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.680]   it's not, now they're saying, by the way, not malicious, but mangled.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.160]   I don't know.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.080]   But Jeanette, you had to go back to what you're saying. It was kind of therapy for me.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.200]   And my first tweet was ding dong. Yes. I saw that. And I was like, yeah,
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   wicked, which is dead. Yeah. And then, and then I, you know, turned around and I said pretty quickly,
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.720]   this is the moment to remember his victims. And then I turned around and the anger came back out
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.640]   and I, I to clean it up just said my entire tweet was ever.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.840]   Yep. You know, and it was, it was, it was a back and forth just for me because Twitter is so
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:08.280]   immediate that the emotions just just are going to come out. Like, yeah, hit me. I don't care.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:16.200]   It's going to be me. Right. So it was actually quite interesting. The next day, and I missed this,
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.880]   otherwise I would have said it right up front, Megan McCartill, followed up. She's the business
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.680]   and economics editor for the Atlantic on how this quote came about. And actually on Facebook was a
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.960]   much longer quote, which is from Martin Luther King, except for that first sentence, which was the
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:36.520]   one retweeted. And she found out who folks posted it first, a 24 year old Penn State graduate who
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:45.480]   teaches English to middle schoolers in Kobe, Japan, Jessica Dovie, and someone stripped and
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:51.480]   pasted the quote and stripped out the quotation marks. In other words, took her, her writing.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:20:00.280]   So she said I will more and then in quotes put more from MLK, somebody missed the fact that missed
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.560]   that subtlety. That happens a lot. Probably because they needed the one character to retweet it.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.840]   Yeah, I had too many characters. Yeah. So that's, that's kind of, but that's good.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:16.440]   Good reporting. Great reporting. And Megan's good. Yeah, no kidding.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.400]   Yeah. So I, I retweeted the, I never wished a man dead by read some obituaries with great
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:27.160]   pleasure quote from Twain. It was actually Clarence Darrow. So the attribution was,
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.560]   wasn't correct. So. But these things get corrected pretty quickly too. That's what that, you know,
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:38.200]   optimist and triumphalist that I am. It comes back around and the internet is also pretty quick
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.080]   at correcting things. Yep. Not in everyone's mind about at least in sensible minds.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:49.160]   Yeah. It's, it's quite, it's quite a fascinating process part of the telephone game that we're
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:56.440]   all playing these days. Let's take a break and come back with more. I think that we've
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:04.200]   talked about this a little bit enough. Do you have real opera for the show here?
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.360]   But well, it was, it's the story. It's the story. If you can't not do it.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.680]   And yeah, we had to. We have to talk about it. Well, first of all, because both of you were there
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:21.480]   in 2001, but also because it really is a reason why we're here. It's the reason why you're there.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.960]   Yeah. It's right. Because you started writing because of that. It gave you a voice.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.000]   Yep. Which I think is very interesting.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.560]   Yep. I did not know that about either of you, both of you. It's kind of interesting.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:40.440]   But it's also. Where were you when it hit? She's frozen. That's what she was frozen.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.360]   I was going to call. She's going to call in. She's lost her batteries died. We'll get her on.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.600]   And I would like to know that. Now we know that Jeff was literally in a building next door,
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:58.920]   which must have been just very scary. Zero. Yeah. I can only imagine.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.960]   And we'll get Gina and find out where she was. But before we do that, though,
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.720]   I would like to take a break. Maybe we all need a little break right now and talk a little bit
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:13.960]   about carbonite.com. There are all kinds of disasters. Some of them little, some of them,
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.480]   obviously quite big. But the disaster you don't want to have happen to you is the data on your
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.840]   hard drive lost forever. Just think of what's on there. Your first blog posts, your pictures of
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.480]   your kids being born, your wedding pictures, your financial records. I mean, I can go on and on.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   It's all on there. And unfortunately, so many of us just don't make a copy. We don't back it up.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.080]   It's just too much trouble. Are we forget to? Or we don't know how to.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.720]   In Yao, you may have an external hard drive that you back things up to once in a while. But
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.520]   really what you really need is an automatic backup that's offsite on multiple servers in
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.080]   multiple locations. That's when your data is really safe. And that's what carbonite does so
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:58.200]   beautifully, so elegantly. If you go to carbonite.com right now, you could sign up free for two weeks
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:03.720]   just to see what happens. Use the offer code twig, T-W-I-G so we get credit. You'll put the
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.840]   software on your Mac or PC. And whenever you're online, it just backs up. It trickles it up because
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.680]   it doesn't want to slow you down with your internet access. It doesn't want to slow your computer down.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.560]   So it's very polite in the background. It trickles it up. Depending on how much data you have,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.720]   it may take some time to get that first backup done. From then on, you're always backed up.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.920]   And you can always check that data anywhere you go just by going to carbonite.com and logging in
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:33.960]   from any computer or with a smartphone. They've got BlackBerry, Android and iOS applications that
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.960]   are free. And you can see your data. It's really cloud storage in addition to backup.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:44.760]   If you decide to buy it, it's the most affordable solution. If you price all the other solutions,
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:51.160]   you'll see that at $59 a year for everything on your internal drive, there is no better price,
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:57.000]   no better value. That's 16 cents a day for a true peace of mind. Try it free for two weeks,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.560]   carbonite.com offer code to it. And if you decide to buy, I'm sorry, offer code twig,
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:07.800]   TWIG TWIG TWIG TWIG TWIG again. And they'll give you 14 months for the price of 12,
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:15.160]   an additional two months free from carbonite.com. When disaster strikes be prepared with carbonite.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.600]   You got to back it up to get it back. Do it right with carbonite.com. Gina, are you on the phone now?
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:27.320]   Hey, can you hear me? Yeah. Awesome. Sorry about that. That's fine. This works just as well. Gina
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:33.320]   lost her power didn't have her power supplies. Lived it at work. So her battery died. I get more
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:41.960]   camera time. It just means I can leave the leave the camera. I know it's all fine. I love
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.200]   doing Twig. There's always a plan B, which I really appreciate and see indeed. I just have
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   learned that nothing ever works. Nothing ever works. Nothing ever works. You have to stand for failure.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.920]   Like Netflix, right? I always, I always, always plan to fail. I never fail to plan. So Jeff asked
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:02.520]   you when we, when you, when you disappeared, where were you on September 11th? At the time I was
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:07.400]   working at a company that was located on Hudson and Spring. So I actually was, I was out of my way
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:12.120]   into work when the second, when the second plane hit. So I was on the F train, which is one of the
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.760]   only trains that goes outside and is elevated in Brooklyn. So I was off in the F train and everyone
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.280]   had stopped and was out the windows because the first tower was smoking. So it looked like there
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.480]   was a fire, you know? But then the second plane hit, you know, but we didn't see the plane. We just
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.360]   saw the explosion and then the train went underground. So everybody on the car was like,
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:36.040]   what is going on? And you know, I, I, so I, you know, I stayed on the train and I arrived in Manhattan
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.920]   and walked down, walked down Hudson Street. And it was just insane. I saw people coming, you know,
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:47.160]   I saw the Jeffs of the world kind of walking uptown covered in foot. And yeah, it was crazy. So I
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.320]   was actually at a seat. I mean, I was a safest since I wasn't at a place where I didn't see
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:57.640]   people jumping. I wasn't close enough to that. So, so I was about a mile and a half north.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.480]   You know, the train could stop and, you know, people were walking across the bridge back to Brooklyn.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.920]   You know, I hung out at the office of my co-workers for quite some time, you know, because then we heard
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.080]   about the Pentagon. I mean, it was, you know, at that moment a panic of like, oh my God, you know,
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.400]   the world ending. So I was at a safe enough distance, but certainly close enough.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.200]   He, a lot.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:23.240]   The ureous moment for, for the scene when I came in, it was the last train under the first,
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:30.120]   the north tower. And I came up to the big concourse, the gigantic escalators up.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.120]   And I arrived at the concourse first, it was quiet, which is weird, never quiet. And I look
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.480]   around all over the concourse and there were all over everywhere, women's shoes empty.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.280]   They'd run that fast out of there when it hit.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.520]   Yeah. So anyway, we'll go on a happier Google.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.840]   That's a very twilight zone image.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.640]   It was holy.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:57.880]   That's right before I was standing at the one more story. It was probably getting in trouble.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.120]   I'm standing at the block, we're from the south tower on Liberty, we're going to go on a block.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.760]   And I'm looking up at the tower and I'm thinking, and I don't know enough about engineering,
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.560]   and I'm thinking, how are they ever going to get that fire out?
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.200]   Like an idiot, I, you know, can figure it out.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.080]   And wait, it's like, oh, they're in the fire.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.240]   Yeah, they're good in some way. They can't burn forever. How is that fire going to get?
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.200]   How are they going to do it? Because of course, they are going to do that.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:29.160]   You know, when the, when the, they arise. And I, a, a tourist, I'll let you guess what country
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.760]   the gentleman was from, but he was taking pictures of the camera.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.400]   Yeah. Yeah. And, um, he got up to me and said, will you take a picture of me with a brown
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:43.160]   towel in the background? And I said, oh my God. People are dying. He said, yeah, I'll remember
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:51.560]   that I survived. Oh boy. I said, no. Good for you. And 10 seconds later, the tower struck.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:58.760]   Yeah, that was the moment when that, yeah, the first tower went, oh,
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.000]   well, we're talking disasters. We'll stay with the disaster mode because of course,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.720]   there've been some horrible tornadoes in Alabama in the south. And Google, again, we know more
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:15.320]   than ever before. We can see what's going on on the Google blog. They posted before and after
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:22.760]   pictures from Google Maps satellite views of various places. This is the university place
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:29.400]   elementary school in Tuscaloosa before and after. And when you see pictures like this, I, you know,
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:35.080]   it's the same thing as your first person accounts, Jeff and Gina. We hear about these things from
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:41.240]   such a distance. I don't think we were, we really had the same thing with the tsunami where, when you
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:46.120]   see pictures, the swath, there's that one little picture, I don't know where it is, but it just
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:52.680]   showed the swath that went across that was just awe inspiring just this long, because it was through
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:58.920]   because the big one was huge and stayed there for a long time. It's you're right. It takes it away
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:04.760]   from the single shots and Google gives that global part of me perspective. Right.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:11.880]   Just that's not that right. You see the path. Just dramatic. So phenomenal. Yeah.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:20.040]   Hard to, hard to imagine the destructive power. This reminds me, these were pictures
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.200]   remind me of the tsunami. Yes. The same kind of devastation.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:30.520]   You know, and it's tempting to think, wow, times are worse than ever before. And I don't think so.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:36.200]   I think we just can see it now. Yeah. Right. Times have always been bad.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.560]   All right. I'm going to give you something more upbeat.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:45.960]   It gets better campaigns. You know, how did that it gets better campaigns start?
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:53.720]   So a columnist named Dan Savage, who does, he does a podcast called Savage Love, and he's a
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:30:00.440]   he's a very well-known and well-liked columnist. Started this during the time that there were like
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:06.600]   several teenage, gay teenage suicides, like three or four in a row. I am recently. And abuse and
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.040]   beatings and things. Yeah. And Dan, so Dan started this campaign called It Gets Better, right? Because
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:18.760]   as, you know, as a gay adult, I look back to what I felt like when I was 15 or 16. I would do anything
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.400]   to go back in time and just say to myself, it gets better. Because let me tell you, it does.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.200]   Yeah. And so this is what Dan did. So he started this YouTube campaign where it was just, it was
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.600]   him and his partner just kind of giving encouragement to gay teens. Because when you're a gay teen,
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.840]   you're alone and you haven't told anyone and you're scared, you don't know what to do. So we started
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.080]   this YouTube campaign saying it gets better. And then he asked other people, celebrities, regular
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:45.640]   people, to do their own clips, giving their own sort of, it gets better message. And he just, he
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.720]   nailed it. You know, it gets better. Those three words, that's exactly what you want to tell
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:55.640]   teenage, and your former teenage self. You know, when you're different anyway, not just gay,
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.800]   when you're suffering, you know, when you're a nerd, when you're just- It gets better for everybody.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:06.120]   Being a teenager is horrible. It is. Being a teenager is horrible, exactly. Exactly. It's true.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.240]   That's an excellent point. So it went viral. I mean, so many people did so many touching videos.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.040]   There are a few that really stood out. Tim Gung was amazing. There was just like, I want to say,
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:21.880]   a mayor in Texas who did one that was also very, very touching. Anyway, so Google,
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:27.800]   and actually Google staff did well much. I think we played or featured on the show a few episodes
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.680]   ago. I actually have not seen this yet because I'm in New York and things are crazy. I have DVR
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.120]   Glee. So I've not seen this on TV yet, but I watched it on YouTube. Google did a Chrome
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:44.200]   commercial based on featuring the It Gets Better videos, Dan's original message,
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:50.280]   and then a montage of other messages, basically showing how Google products like YouTube,
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.560]   and I guess there's something like Chrome, you know, get this message across.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:59.800]   Let me play it because I think it's really worth giving them a minute on Twig to see it.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.040]   Yep.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:16.360]   High school was bad. I was obviously gay, and some kids didn't like that, and I did get harassed.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:21.880]   What I'd love you to take away from it is that over bad it is now it gets better,
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:28.440]   and it can get great. And it's important for adults to reach out to kids and share our stories
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.800]   so that they can picture futures for themselves that are with sticking around for it.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:38.120]   Okay, little ones. Here's the first thing you need to know. You are perfect and wonderful
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:43.000]   exactly as you are. You're not alone. There are a ton of us out here in this world. We love you
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:55.960]   without even knowing you. There's art to be made, there are songs to be sung. So long. Look at me,
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:02.520]   idiot's old, it gets better with age. Listen to me. It gets better. It gets better. It gets better.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:10.280]   It does get better. Almost said it will. So much better. You'll be fine partner. Your life can be
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:20.280]   amazing, but you have to tough this period of it out and you have to live.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:37.000]   Wow. It's such a great commercial, and it's so classy of Google to stand back and yes, the message
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.560]   there as you use the internet to do all these wonderful things and that's great, but it really
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.960]   is Google handing over the front of that platform to them.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:52.520]   Yeah. And also during Glee, which is like the gay show. It's just so perfect. Well, you got to
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.760]   figure if you're gay, teen, you're watching. You're watching. No doubt. Well, right. Yeah.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.440]   Along with millions of other people like me. God, I'm completely choked up. I'm sorry.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:09.320]   I hate to say this, but cynics might say, well, it's a Google ad. I mean, they're kind of taking
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.280]   advantage. Are they taking advantage of this? They did manage to get some. For those of you
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.720]   listening, you didn't see every product used it. Whereas a Google product. There's YouTube,
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:25.000]   there was Blogger. I mean, they congratulated Dan. They said this is important.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.840]   They was a Google ad for sure. No doubt, right? But they were promoting Google as a platform
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.560]   for whatever message. That message, the web is what you wanted to be. That's what they were doing.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.760]   They're promoting the web as a platform and Google's tools as a platform to make a change.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:48.760]   And that to me, I love that message. I mean, if I didn't believe in that, I wouldn't be here.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.760]   I wouldn't be working on the web. So I can get over that, but it was a Google ad.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:58.040]   Yeah. I think it goes beyond that. I think that it also says that a decent company can
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:05.880]   create tools and create the means that people can then do great things. And a decent company
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:11.480]   respects people for doing these things. And Leo, you're right. When I saw it, my socks were blown off
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:18.440]   because it was very moving and it was so impressive to see it in that form. And it's what you said
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.960]   earlier. It's not just the campaign. I don't want to dilute its message, which is about being
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:29.320]   a gay teenager, but it's about the trouble of being whatever you have trouble with in life.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:34.760]   And it's for a total for everybody. It's not just for any
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.760]   and anybody for whom life is not perfect. It gets better.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:45.080]   Right. And that's the whole point of sticking around and doing things. And, you know,
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:50.600]   so many PSAs are aimed at, you know, don't bully. Don't do the bad things. What I love about this
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:56.280]   is it's aimed at the, I hate to use the word victim, but the objects of the bad behavior to say,
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:03.240]   no, you're okay and it's going to get better. And that's a really powerful message for people.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:10.040]   And I think that Google used expensive time to basically share its time with that message is a
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:15.320]   good thing. And also promote that the web gets you connected to people who are like you, even
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.200]   when you feel like there's no one else like you and no one else knows your experience,
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.280]   like on the web, you will find those people. Yeah, it's an ad for the internet, isn't it?
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.240]   It was an ad for the internet, exactly. Yep.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.880]   Well, they're doing something right. According to a Harris survey, Google has the top brand
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:39.720]   reputation of any company in America. Google scored a, they call it a reputation quotient
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:46.040]   of 84.5. That made it number one ahead of Johnson and Johnson,
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:53.560]   the 3M company, Berkshire Hathaway, then Apple, then Intel and Kraft, then Amazon,
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:58.120]   then Walt Disney and General Mills. All in the 80s. I mean, I don't think any of those companies
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:05.560]   would feel bad being in that top 10. But Google the best. I mean, it makes sense, right? If like,
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.880]   did you Google it? Like, I know something Google gives me. Yeah. You know, like, that's what it is.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.600]   Like, I, I cat-a-thought and then Google filled in the blank. The categories that they,
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.560]   there are 30,000 people were surveyed. So it's a very large sample.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:23.240]   Of their opinions of the top 60 most visible companies in the US, the categories
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:29.080]   include emotional appeal, products and services, social responsibility,
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:34.680]   vision and leadership, workplace environment, and financial performance. Boy, I'd have to,
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.800]   you'd have to score Google 10 out of 10 on all those. Except maybe emotional appeal,
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.680]   although when you see an ad like it gets better, they're doing a very good job of scoring high there.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.200]   Yes.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.200]   They were.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:54.040]   I think there's an emotional appeal. At the same time, Leo, the brand Z brand value came out,
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:00.200]   where they, they put a monetary value to top 100 global brands. Google is number one again this
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:05.480]   year has been, since they've been doing it this for five years, it's up 14%. And they put a,
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:12.120]   now I'm going to do this wrong. If it's a, if it says 114,000 and it's in dollars and millions,
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:20.280]   is that 114 billion or is that 114 trillion? Ask the programmer. I'm just some schmuck on TV.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.800]   I don't have my calculator.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.200]   I don't even understand the question, Gina.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:33.240]   As soon as I heard the numbers, I went, huh, squirrels.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:38.200]   It's worth a lot. It's worth just incredible about this a lot. A lot.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:44.280]   I'll IBM number two, oddly, Apple number three. I don't know why I put, you get IBM in there.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:51.400]   How do you get IBM in there? It's worldwide classy. I guess so Microsoft for Coca-Cola five,
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.880]   McDonald's six. I got a point.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:57.800]   I was at Marlboro numbers. This is worldwide Marlboro number seven.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:02.280]   That's Japan. Put that one over the top. I have to say Facebook on this Harris poll,
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:09.640]   31st place way down, but still better than the bottom of the hate. You want to take a guess with
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:19.320]   a worst? The worst companies were the lowest rated companies. AIG BP, Goldman Sachs,
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.720]   Citigroup. I think you get the, I think you get the message here.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:30.280]   And I couldn't disagree. I couldn't, I couldn't agree more with that assessment.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.120]   Wow. I mean, these are just polls. I don't think they have that much value, but I think it's fairly
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.680]   accurately representing the fact that Google, despite all the stuff we talk about, the privacy
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:45.800]   issues, the creepy factor and all of that is still considered of a quality brand.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.320]   And Apple that? Apple's fifth.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:55.800]   And I think, of course, this, I don't know if this came about at the same time as the location data
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:00.680]   or location gate as they're calling it. The interesting thing is Apple did a really good
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:06.600]   job, I think, of saying, hey, it's not us, it's Google. It really pointed the finger. I mean,
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:13.080]   Steve virtually said that in the interview with Ina Free that All Things D. He says,
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:17.560]   why aren't you guys? I hope you guys will look at the other people and we know who the other
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:23.080]   people are. What are they doing? And he, you know, he does make a point unlike there's,
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:28.440]   there's different approaches. Google is a little more upfront to begin with about what they're doing.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.720]   Both of them, I would say, do exactly the same thing we should say. I mean, this is,
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:38.040]   this is the business that they're in is collecting information about their users to sell the marketers
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:45.160]   or for other reasons. But Google does tell you more upfront, but Apple has an advantage because
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:50.120]   before any programs allowed to use your location data on an iPhone, it warns you and then, and you
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:57.320]   can never turn that warning off. That's permanent. Apple also today put out an update fixing the
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:05.240]   location bug. They claim, bug in iPhones of 666 megabyte download. I don't know how the internet
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:11.960]   survives this stuff. 35 million iOS users, all of whom are going to download. Now they're gonna get
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:19.400]   your calculator out for that one. 666 megabytes. Holy bandwidth. Holy bandwidth, Batman.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:25.400]   But I do think Apple does, does, does win the award on that one first because anytime it
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:32.040]   locates, no. When it turns on the microphone or camera, they don't tell me. But anytime I
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.280]   use a location, the app says, well, maybe it actually, no, I'm doing force, I guess it doesn't
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.880]   do it every time. Eventually it gives up and says, okay, I guess you want to allow it.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:47.320]   But now I'm question from an iPad news. I need to hook my iPad up to my Mac in order to get the
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:54.280]   notification about the about the update, right? That's correct. There's no push. So, so whatever
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:59.880]   your iOS device, yeah, you'll have to connect it. And in fact, mine, it didn't alert me. I had
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:08.680]   to say check for update. Although I imagine it would have. Yep. Speaking of iPads. Yes.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:15.960]   It's a crow moment. He bought another one. Well, yeah, I mean, it's the only one I have, but I
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.640]   have, you know, you can't see, but I have an iPad. It's holding up an iPad. Is it a one or a two?
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:26.600]   It's a two. It's a two. I lean Rivera, who hosts are all about Android show produces this show,
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:32.040]   is shocked. She, I mean, she had that moment. She had, we're going to call it the Hillary Clinton
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:40.600]   moment now. She covered her mouth. I'm not kidding. Oh my God. Somebody please Photoshop that.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.480]   Oh, they already are. Yeah. Yeah. I see channel. Please somebody Photoshop. Get
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:51.160]   Eileen in there covering your mouth instead of. Well, here's the pathetic thing, right?
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:58.600]   If I can show the laptop to I've actually walked around the house with my iPhone, my Galaxy tab,
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:07.400]   and my iPad and my laptop. How sick is this? To do what play angry birds? No, this is your job.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:15.080]   Now that you are a full fledged internet superstar, you must carry all of these at all time.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:20.520]   Then you forget your charger somewhere. And you're back to the telephone.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:26.600]   So for those who don't know, we're talking about the, it's the very famous situation room of the
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:33.400]   president and secretary of state and probably members of the Joints Chief of Staff in the situation
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:43.240]   room, apparently getting the news that Osama bin Laden had been killed. It is now the second most viewed
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:53.080]   picture on Flickr in just about three or four days. Yeah. And yeah, they're putting people from
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:58.280]   Jersey shore in there. I don't know if you noticed the one I'm showing you. There does seem to be a
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:03.480]   topless fellow by the president. The little girl from the balcony of the royal wedding is there at
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:09.080]   the table next to Hillary. Yeah, with her hands over her ears. Oh my God. You know, I put this up.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:15.080]   I thought this was the actual picture. I didn't notice that Mike, the situation,
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.600]   Sorrentino was standing bare chested behind the president. That's just, well, I just thought it was
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:27.560]   maybe that was Chuck Norris, because wasn't he involved? I love remix culture. Yeah. Isn't it great?
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:33.640]   By the way, others have noticed PC magazine in particular that both vice president Joe Biden
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:40.680]   and Secretary of State Clinton use Hewlett Packard notebook computers. I don't know if we care.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:46.200]   You know, this picture was made to edit because there's this all this blank space behind the
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:51.160]   president here that you could really do almost anything with. So yeah, get ready. The meme is on
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:56.920]   its way, although it's such to be honest, it's such a serious and momentous picture. It's a picture.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:03.000]   One of those pictures that you know, you will see for decades to come. Friend of mine named Rex
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.040]   Hammock blog, Rex blog, wrote about the pictures and say, why was it so powerful? And his assumption
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:13.320]   was that you're looking at the president in this moment, but then he got the original
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:18.200]   photographer's size and went around and realized that no, it's Hillary that is the focus of the
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:24.520]   picture that her eyes, if you look closely at it and her in her expression are quite amazing.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.840]   I think you're exactly right. What happens is you first see the president and then
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:36.040]   you go and then you see Secretary Clinton and it is quite a surprise. I haven't seen
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:41.800]   a remixes of the pixelated piece of paper on her laptop. Or was that pixelated? It is pixelated.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:51.960]   Clearly born. Clearly born. That looks like a map. Yeah. That looks like a map.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:59.640]   Also looks like there's no Wi-Fi there. No, look at that. Let's overdo the semiotics.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:04.440]   Well, in the situation room, you would hope there's not Wi-Fi. That would be very depressing,
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.520]   but they've all got their ethernet cables plugged in.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:12.520]   I think the White House just published a picture of everybody's Blackberry at the outside of a
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.680]   room. They were the briefing and I guess you have to surrender your mobile.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:20.760]   That's an older picture that was posted a year or two ago when Obama first took
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.680]   office and they leave their Blackberries outside. That is a dramatic picture as well.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:30.680]   If you don't follow the White House Flickr stream, you should. I think it's Pete Sousa. I think all
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:36.360]   those pictures come from Pete Sousa. He's quite amazing. We'll see Gina on it coming up.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:45.720]   Me, my gene is going to the White House. By last night, 3.6 million views, 3.6 million views of that
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.760]   photo on Flickr making it the second most viewed. The first most viewed took years to get to
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:58.440]   the higher numbers. I have a feeling this is going to be the most viewed photo of all time on Flickr.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:04.680]   Again, another example of how we're getting our news direct from, in this case, from the White
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:10.280]   House, which of course the White House loves because it gets to control the image making.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.440]   Very powerful. I saw some controversy on one of the press blogs on Roman
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:19.400]   Escot today that after Obama gave the speech, he went back to the podium in front of the
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:24.680]   teleprompter and photographers came in and took pictures of him. People say, "It's staged."
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:31.880]   What the hell isn't staged in life? It's all staged. It's all staged. Sorry,
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:35.960]   either, but there is a tradition. I remember this when I worked for NBC. There's a tradition.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:41.720]   It's in the green book that they've hand out to all employees that you don't stage
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:46.840]   news events, that you only take pictures as it happens. At no point are you allowed to say to
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.040]   the newsmaker, "Would you stand here so I can get a better background?"
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.680]   That's not the case anymore. Really?
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:59.160]   I don't know, Inside Edition are one of those kinds of shows to come and do the
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:03.640]   death or story today in my office here. They're dressing the set. They're moving the stuff around
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.080]   behind me. They're telling me, "You repeat this with that word and that word?" Of course,
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:12.040]   it's not exactly NBC News, but... It's Inside Edition. What were they asking you about?
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.440]   The death or thing and conspiracy theories and does the internet make it worse?
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.760]   Right. It's like asking me whether this was a defining moment for Twitter.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:29.640]   I know. It's sad that we need to go through this, but this is why Twitter exists because I got
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:35.560]   so sick of mainstream media coverage of technology. I heard you before,
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:41.320]   between the two shows that you said, "This show will never be on cable."
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:51.800]   It's a mutual, by the way. They don't want me as much as I don't want them.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   This is presumably the staged... It doesn't look staged. Picture after the speech.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:02.680]   I mean, I don't know. I think it's... If Pete Sousa taking the picture,
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:08.920]   boy, he's a good photojournalist. I don't think that most of these are staged,
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:18.600]   but that's different. He is the White House photographer. It's his job to get compelling images for history.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:27.480]   He's not a journalist. I do hope that there is some ethos still in journalism that you don't.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:36.120]   Oh, well, you don't stage. Give it up, Pollyanna. Give it up. There's nothing real.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:42.200]   I get a fronted. I think we were in a situation where we were about to do something in the producer,
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:47.960]   the shooter said, "Can you do that again?" I said, "No, I get a fronted." That's staging.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:52.200]   I'm the last old man.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:57.400]   Well, you know, on the show on the media, on NPR, it's a wonderful show.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:02.360]   The first time I went in there to do the show, as walking out of the hall, the producer said,
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:08.520]   "You know, I should tell you that we edit Bob Garfield." I didn't know why he told me that.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:13.720]   You get in and Bob, God bless him. He's a friend and I love him. He's very good on the show,
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:19.480]   but he flunked first through questions. He changes five times around. He changes everything.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.520]   They did a great story. The correspondent who did it died this year.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:28.760]   Great story about five years ago, where they went through and confessed, "This is how we do
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:33.400]   an NPR show." They call themselves sometimes sound Nazis.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:41.800]   They are sound Nazis. They think I pop too much. They won't let me. I think all things
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:46.360]   considered are morning edition piece. With this set up, they said, "No, no, we can't use it.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:53.640]   You're popping too much." I jumped through hoops. It took an hour.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.600]   You see high standards, Leo. That's crazy.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.080]   That was the highest. Again, I think that gets sometimes a little bit in the way of
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:06.440]   spontaneity and authenticity. We're going to take a break. Come back with more
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:13.320]   Gina Trapanias here via phone from Brooklyn, Jeff Jarvis via Skype from New York City.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:18.040]   We are talking about the Google. Somebody tweeted me, "Why don't you do a cloud computing show?
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:21.800]   This is it." We just call it this week at Google, but it's all about the cloud.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:27.880]   It's a lot about media. It's about how the internet and society and all of that.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.520]   Jeff, did you get an invite to go to the EG8?
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:36.520]   Yes. Good. We can be roomies. I got an apartment.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.720]   You did.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.880]   Yeah. Don't worry about the hotel.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.640]   I still have to get...
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.600]   I went in on the sleepover.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:51.800]   You can come. There's plenty of room. See you in Paris. I'm flying out May 20th through the 27th.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.160]   Wow. You're really going.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:57.880]   You know why? If you don't stay over on a Saturday to kill you, the year first twice is bad.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.520]   And it's Paris.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:06.680]   If it were to Panga Canyon, maybe it'd be a two-day trip.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:12.760]   I have all my entrepreneurial journalists are doing their presentations to VCs on the 23rd.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.240]   Oh.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.680]   So I got to fly out that night.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.240]   Oh my goodness.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.200]   No, I have that point.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.880]   Well, I didn't want to be jet lagged, but good.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.560]   You just tell me what to say and I'll be right out.
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:21.880]   Yes, exactly.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:22.360]   Bushytale.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:28.840]   We're going to also talk about video chat on your Android phone. It's here.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:33.240]   Google I/O. Gina and I will be at Google I/O. We'll tell you what that is.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.440]   I'm jealous about that.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.240]   Yeah, see.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.760]   I get to hang with Gina next week.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.720]   But first, let me tell you about Netflix.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:45.400]   The great way to get movies right into your own home.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:49.400]   You know, Netflix really pioneered the idea of no late fees.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.600]   That's why I first became a Netflix customer in 2000.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.600]   I've been a member since December 2000.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:58.760]   And thousands of movies later, I'm just a huge fan.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.320]   DVDs by mail and as little as one business day.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.640]   I have a five-disc queue.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.400]   You can have as many as one to five discs.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.120]   And what happens is you just hold those discs so you watch the movie,
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   then you mail it back and they're prepaid mailer.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.480]   Those famous red envelopes.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:14.040]   Just to have one here somewhere.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.040]   Probably mailed it.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.480]   And then you get another movie and the turnaround is like a day or two.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.120]   It's amazing.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:26.600]   But you can get it even faster with the even better watch instantly feature
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.680]   that Netflix debuted a year or so ago.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.920]   And I have to say this is getting bigger and bigger.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:35.480]   In fact, as I look at it, almost every day I'll go to Netflix.com/twit
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:41.400]   and I'll see that they have added more first-run movies, mainstream stuff,
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.280]   television shows.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.840]   They're just growing this thing like crazy.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.640]   And the beauty of this is you can watch any of these movies
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.560]   right now with your Netflix account.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.480]   All you have to do is go to Netflix.com/twit
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.120]   and you can get this free for 30 days.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   Movies that I missed in the theater,
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.600]   TV shows that I'd like to go back and see like Glee.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.560]   Classics too.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.520]   Like how to get ahead and advertising.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:11.880]   I never did see that when that came out.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.200]   I just, I die to see this.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.000]   So there you go.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.040]   I can watch that right now.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.960]   Just press that button and I'm watching it.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.040]   In fact, really the truth is it's hard to get to work sometimes
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:22.200]   because I just want to watch one more movie.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.120]   How about "Spinal Tap"?
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:29.000]   When you hear them say it goes to 11,
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.600]   they're talking about "Spinal Tap".
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.480]   What a great movie.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.640]   What would it be fun to go home and watch that tonight?
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.680]   You can instantly.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:37.480]   You could do it.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.560]   You could set it up right now so that you can watch it tonight.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:43.320]   On your TV set, if you've got a Roku box or PlayStation 3
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.840]   or an Xbox or a Wii, many Blu-ray players even have Netflix.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:47.960]   It's kind of the gold standard.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:51.080]   You're not really internet connected if you don't have a Netflix account
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.040]   on your device.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.720]   Of course, your computer too.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.120]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.880]   You get the movies in the DVDs in this little one business day and
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.280]   watch any mo-
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.240]   I love this.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.840]   Local favorites for Petaluma.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.240]   They actually, because they know I'm in Petaluma,
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.320]   they say this is what your neighbors are watching.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.040]   They have good taste.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.160]   Look what they're watching.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.880]   "Battle Star Galactica", all 76 episodes.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.760]   Oh, oh.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.720]   I got it.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:18.440]   It's time.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.000]   It's time.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.920]   That's kind of that puts you over the top, huh?
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.760]   It's time for rewatch on the B.S.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.040]   I haven't, you know what?
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.440]   I'm absolutely, I missed a few in the middle there too.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.480]   My so-called life.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.520]   Oh, that was a good one.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.720]   Classic teen drama.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.160]   That was like the original teen drama.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.160]   "Spon the Hole".
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:37.960]   Twin Peaks.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.360]   That was just wild.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.720]   I wouldn't mind watching that again.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.280]   Oh, baseball season's here.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.560]   How about Ken Burns baseball?
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:47.480]   All you gotta do.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.400]   Oh, and the original Swedish,
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.960]   the girl who played with fire
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.400]   and the girl with the dragon tattoo.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.960]   The, I like the Swedish versions.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:59.000]   They're so good and they're really kind of dark.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.880]   If you're in the mood for a dark kind of.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.200]   Yeah, those are beautifully shot.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.640]   I watched those on Netflix.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.200]   Aren't they great?
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.680]   I love Netflix when you're traveling too.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.440]   Like I love that I was watching something
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.680]   on my Roku at home and then now I'm on the road
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.240]   and I just brought up my iPad and she resumed, you know.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.560]   It's great on the iPad, the iPhone 2 and the,
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:19.960]   and the not the Android phone yet, but soon.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:24.040]   Netflix.com/Twit.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.040]   Not Twig, but Twit.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:26.760]   Give it a try.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.000]   If you haven't yet a member,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.160]   don't forget, and I do this all the time.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.360]   You could give, give certificates my mom
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.800]   every year on her birthday.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.640]   She gets a yours worth of Netflix.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:38.680]   And I think that's really great.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.560]   That's a good idea.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.960]   Oh, it's the, well, it's they do it by email.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.320]   Let me see if I can find that here.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:50.120]   It's really, give subscriptions.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.800]   Buy a gift subscription.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.080]   So you could get a month to get a,
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.080]   but I just every year on our birthday is a mom.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:59.160]   And, and this is the, by the way, the 799 a month
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.240]   is probably what I'll start doing.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:04.200]   You, that's no DVDs, but just watch instantly.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.520]   For 990, mine a month, you get watched instantly,
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.880]   plus a DVD at a time.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.760]   Hey, everybody, Mother's Day is upon us.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.200]   Wouldn't this be a great gift for mom?
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:16.280]   And you could, and see even, they even mail it with a card.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:18.680]   I mean, email it.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.760]   So that's kind of nice because you, you, you know,
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:27.720]   dear mom, a gift for you from Netflix.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.160]   Netflix.com/Twit.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:33.640]   Um, moving right along here.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.560]   Google I/O. What is Google I/O, Gina?
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.760]   We're going next week, right?
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:39.960]   We're going to cover it, I think.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:40.600]   We are.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.080]   We are.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.320]   Google I/O is pure awesome.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:43.960]   That's what it is.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:47.080]   It's a developer event at the
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.680]   Moscone Center in San Francisco.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.760]   It's next week, the 10th at 11th.
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:53.160]   And, you know, it's, it's really fun.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:55.880]   It's a developer-focused conference,
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:58.520]   but there's often goodies and announcements
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.400]   at the keynote, right?
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.720]   So the first keynote is Tuesday at 9,
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.240]   and I'll be there if I am Monday night,
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.760]   and I fly out Wednesday night.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.920]   And, um, yeah, I hope we're to cover it.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.880]   I would love to see you.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.480]   Are you going to cover the Moscone kind of sleigh?
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.760]   Yeah, we were going back and forth.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:13.320]   And I think, you know, the last year,
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.760]   we covered the Tuesday keynote,
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.920]   and it turned out all the big announcements were on Wednesday.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.880]   We're Wednesday, right?
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.560]   Right.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.720]   I don't know if Google has gotten it together or not,
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.720]   but we are going to, I'll come for the Tuesday keynote.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.680]   You and I'll be there.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:26.120]   Um, fantastic.
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.640]   And then, um, we, we, we, I don't know.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.960]   Should we have Tom sit in the studio and, and cover it?
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:32.600]   I guess we should.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.720]   Uh, and then you and I'll come out and we'll talk about it.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.600]   And then Wednesday, I guess we'll cover it on, on this weekend, Google.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:41.480]   Um, later in the day, but uh...
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.520]   Right, we'll do our regular time.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.680]   Do you think, yeah, do you think that we'll see,
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.680]   what, what big announcements do you expect?
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:47.320]   Anything?
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:47.640]   I mean...
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.520]   Gosh, you know, I, I tell you,
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.080]   I haven't really kept up on one of the rumors.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:53.880]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.840]   I mean, last year it was all sort of about Google TV, right?
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.240]   And last year, Wave was still alive and well,
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.560]   and very much present at, at the event.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:05.080]   This year, obviously, Wave is going to be around and, uh, I'd be interested to see,
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:08.840]   you know, are there going to be, I mean, I feel like this year is going to be all about tablets
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.240]   and honeycomb because Android is a huge present.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.000]   They want developers to develop on Android.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.800]   So I, if, if it goes like last year,
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:18.680]   I imagine there's going to be some Android related announcements,
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.680]   hopefully, uh, maybe a new device.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:24.200]   Perhaps that the attendees will get, I'm not sure.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.680]   That's, every year so far they've done that, haven't they?
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.720]   Yeah, every year so far.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.800]   And then maybe hopefully some Google TV announcements,
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:35.240]   I just feel like Google TV, you know, it launched and, you know, it's not so good.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.600]   It was kind of a flop.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:37.160]   It was a flop.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.840]   In fact, Logitech says, well, we only sold, what was it, $5 million worth?
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.200]   Whoa.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:43.800]   So it's a real flop.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.760]   So this is the Google I/O, officially Android app.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.600]   So there's a map schedule sessions.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:54.520]   You can do this five days, 18 hours, 43 minutes and 16 seconds until Google I/O.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.320]   There's even, and I like this on the app, a real-time stream.
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.440]   So even if you can't make it there, you could download it.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.560]   And this is the Twitter stream and follow what people are saying about it.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.560]   I wonder if they're going to have in the real-time stream video as well, perhaps.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.800]   I do like that the report is that the new Google TV is going to come out.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.840]   So basically what we spent the last year is that nobody's used Google TV.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.280]   What do I do with my $300 boat anchor then?
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.680]   I think it really needs a market.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:21.880]   It really needs more apps.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.120]   I mean, I just, it's, it's in dire need of an update.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.480]   But you know, some dark horse candidates for things Google might announce.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:34.840]   It's Google's social effort, which refuses to die.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.280]   I don't know if it's going to be called Google Me, but we keep hearing rumors about it.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.160]   Some sort of unified social effort.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.920]   Google Music.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.080]   I don't know what happened to that.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.760]   They announced that last year at Google I/O.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.120]   They did.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.920]   That's actually a very viable candidate for an office this year.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.160]   I bet that would get people excited.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.760]   So we'll we'll cover it.
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.720]   Talk about last year.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.320]   We'll be there.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.920]   And if, you know, if nothing exciting happens, you and I go out and get a play to spaghetti.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.160]   That's beautiful.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.200]   That's beautiful.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:06.760]   Beautiful.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.640]   Beautiful.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.840]   I got you some pizza.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.200]   Actually, I wouldn't.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.200]   I'd be embarrassed to give you California pizza.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.440]   And nothing good out of here.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.360]   Even the places, there's places here like called New York pizza.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.640]   That's not New York pizza.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.520]   That's not New York.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.520]   What are you talking about New York pizza?
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.720]   Take your pizza and shove it with a sun don't shine.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.040]   You're good Leo.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.920]   I'm learning from the best.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.840]   I love the conference app though.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.960]   I think I've been to more conferences lately that use an app.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.920]   I went to the GitHub conference and they use mention it.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.960]   Which is sort of a generic app where you can load your data in.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.920]   So I really appreciate not having a deal with paper.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.400]   I thought that real-time stream, which seems to be mostly Twitter,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:54.840]   but I thought that was really kind of a cool idea to be able to open up your app and say,
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.800]   well, what are people talking about?
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:56.680]   You're sitting in the speech.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.920]   I mean, we'll be using it on Tuesday for sure.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:07.560]   We have now an explanation, according to Giga Om from Eric Schmidt,
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.240]   about how Google hires.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.800]   Actually, Eric could probably talk about how Google fires as well.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   See.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.280]   Here are some tips.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.720]   Eric Schmidt passes along for getting a job with Google.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.760]   Be exceptional.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:29.880]   You've heard about the brain teasers and so forth,
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:34.760]   but Schmidt says we spend more time in pretty much ruthlessly on academic qualifications,
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.840]   intelligence, intellectual creativity, passion, and commitment.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:43.640]   I find irony that they still go after the school thing.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.120]   They're big on academics.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:51.080]   Which is kind of ridiculous because I argue that schools are not good at preparing people to be
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.560]   Google because they teach you to do the predictable thing.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.040]   I agree.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:58.120]   People who should go after Google, I mean, this is what Peter Thiel says.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.800]   Peter Thiel, you know, is offering money to people to support people to drop out of school.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.920]   Really?
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.720]   She should go after the dropouts.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.640]   He's got a scholarship and the scholarship is to pay you not to go to college.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.240]   Wow.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.520]   Is he considering that investment?
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.480]   What is it?
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.640]   You think, you know, college ruins you.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.080]   And this is very Peter Thiel, right?
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.800]   He's the guy who put half a million in Facebook is now worth billions because of it.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.200]   Not his only investment by any means, but just a good one.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.240]   I'm the teal fellow shipments call.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.840]   The foster, the next generation of tech visionaries.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.800]   I'd like to get that.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.040]   I think we're too old.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:36.760]   Oh, damn.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.720]   I dropped out of school.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.000]   He can give me a little money.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.760]   You can apply if you're under 20.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:41.000]   No.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.400]   Whether you're in high school, college, or not in school,
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.640]   and you have a great answer to one of these questions,
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.680]   you can get a grant for $100,000 from Peter Thiel.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:51.000]   Wow.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.760]   Good on him.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.720]   That's the kind of FU to the Google way.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.120]   You know, Google, you got to have it ever before.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.240]   Oh, that story says you better have at least a three sevens as the little one.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:01.720]   Three seven.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:08.360]   But I do think that they're looking for some sort of metric because, you know,
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.440]   you got probably millions of people applying.
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:14.440]   You also have to have the ability to answer math questions over the phone with no calculator.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:15.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.840]   Fail.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.320]   Fail.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:17.800]   Fail.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.320]   I didn't even understand the question.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.480]   At least Gina got out the calculator.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.000]   Can I share a viciously Google answers the questions?
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:25.720]   No, Google.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.360]   I'm like an interview.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.840]   But I wonder maybe you could use Wolfram Alpha.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.840]   Eric says, do your own thing.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:39.560]   They're looking for people who don't need much management.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.840]   At Google, we give the impression of not managing the company because we don't.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.840]   It's sort of very--
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.240]   They're in life.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.280]   Few of the recent problems.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.200]   He says it sort of has its own Borg-like quality, if you will.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.720]   It sort of just moves forward.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.760]   Maybe they need to hire a few Navy SEALs.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.360]   I love Eric Schmidt.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.440]   At this point, he is just--
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.160]   Ask anything.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.520]   Don't say anything.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.040]   It's own Borg-like quality.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.400]   Yeah, but I don't know.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.200]   The comparing Google to the Borg is really a good idea, but--
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:13.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.600]   Just kind of plays on our primal fears, that kind of thing.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.160]   He says, not necessarily to have a winning personality.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.680]   He says, I love that one.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.240]   You're going to have to deal with the odd people.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:28.680]   Not every single one of those incredibly smart people is a--
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.160]   what we call a team player.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.400]   Even if people don't want them around, we still need them.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.040]   They all have the garlic pizza.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.080]   Hi, what you working on?
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.800]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.000]   I would take someone who is easy to work with, over someone who's super smart,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.080]   but it's a pain in the butt any day.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.280]   Well, that's why you're not Google.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:52.920]   Well, right.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.880]   And that's why I couldn't even get an interview at Google when I tried back.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.920]   You couldn't?
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.160]   I never heard that story.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:05:59.960]   Yeah, oh, yes.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.760]   I tried really hard through a friend who worked there.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.520]   I had kind of an internal recommendation.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.200]   They would not even call me.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.000]   Like it was like not even--
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:07.480]   Wow.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.360]   Do they say why?
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.880]   I mean, they know they didn't say why, but you know, I didn't go to an IV.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.440]   I mean, I did well in school, but I went to a pretty like mediocre school.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.720]   Two-stroke one?
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.000]   Yeah, I'm in Brooklyn, right?
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.480]   But you know, at the time, I didn't have a whole lot of personal projects that were like,
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.960]   you know, that if I hadn't started an open source project,
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.000]   I hadn't done personal work.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.120]   I had work experience, but I hadn't gone out really and done my own thing.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.480]   So I think that's probably where I went wrong.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.120]   Although, I don't know.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:34.920]   I don't know.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:40.920]   But I mean, obviously, anybody who looks at Gina Trapani would say Google made a mistake.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.040]   There was an opportunity there.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:42.680]   Yeah, it was there.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.240]   So this is not a perfect system by any means.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.920]   The other thing, and I know this for a fact,
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.640]   because Colleen, our former chief engineer, went to Google.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:53.560]   And they said, be prepared because you're going to be--
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.040]   the interview process basically never ends.
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:01.720]   Schmidt said Google had interviewed some people as many as 16 times before deciding not even to hire them.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.800]   They've decided now the interview process should be made in five interviews.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.320]   But how many times did Colleen go back?
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:07.960]   I can't remember.
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.480]   But it took a couple of years and dozens of interviews.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.520]   Years?
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.320]   It took--
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.880]   So impressed with her persistence.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.760]   She lived to work for Google.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.840]   And you always knew that, right?
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.040]   She told me before I hired her, she said, OK, but I got to warn you,
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.880]   if Google comes calling, I'm leaving.
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.640]   And I said, fine.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.600]   You know, I encouraged it.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:32.920]   And we watched as she applied again and again.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:38.200]   She was really had a good spirit, but it was heartbreaking for me,
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.640]   because she'd go through this long process and get very close.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:46.120]   The first time she got down to the last, I think, three or four people,
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.960]   and they declined her.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.440]   And she was-- I mean, she was this close.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:55.720]   And then-- but the good news is-- and this is maybe a lesson for anybody who's been applying at Google.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.360]   They do apparently keep you in the system because they called back.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.920]   Later, months, maybe a year later.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:06.200]   And she went through another long, grueling process where you just talk to all these people.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:16.200]   You know, it's-- I understand what a challenge it is to figure out how to hire somebody.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.200]   I think-- and they're very engineering-driven, but I think you could be too engineering-driven.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:29.880]   Video chat coming to the Android phone if you ever get 2.3.4.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:37.240]   I guess the Nexus 1 is getting it first, or is it the Nexus S?
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.280]   I think it's the Nexus S.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.000]   Nexus S?
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:39.800]   OK.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.040]   When?
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:46.440]   In the next few weeks, that's part of the Android 2.3.4 over there update.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:46.760]   Awesome.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.400]   And so it'll be basically like Face Dapples FaceTime.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:53.800]   You'll have a-- it'll be part of the GTalk, and you'll have a video
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.600]   that'll use the front-facing phone.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.680]   Sounds pretty cool.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.200]   Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.400]   There are screenshots on the--
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.680]   But you have to have gingerbread.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:10.120]   2.3.4, and they say they will launch it to other 2.3 plus devices in the future.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.880]   My G2X is still 2.2.2.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.720]   Although, I think we're going to--
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.840]   Cyanogen's going to come on all about Android and mod it.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.200]   I'm going to get-- I'm going to get the Cyanogen modding my phone.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:22.840]   Right off.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.320]   Isn't that cool?
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:23.720]   That's--
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.040]   Wait.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.720]   Good on Jason Howell and Eileen Rivera who booked Cyanogen on their show to mod my phone.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.000]   I feel like I'm in good hands.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   But that we're still waiting.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.040]   The mod isn't stable yet.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:34.920]   We'll be stable soon.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.040]   I think you're going to see if your next guest can mod your phone.
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.200]   Who's my next guest?
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.600]   Oh, Cap and Crunch?
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.160]   No way!
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.640]   Hey, hey, John.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.000]   What can you do with this?
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.360]   Yeah, with triangulation's coming up in about an hour with John Draper, Captain Crunch.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:57.640]   That-- he's just a walking piece of computer history is what he is.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.920]   I'm a little disappointed.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.960]   Google has agreed to play ball with carriers who want to pull tethering apps
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.760]   from the marketplace.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:18.120]   And as this is my next, says, "Krisigler writing," this kind of violates the spirit of open access,
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:18.760]   does it not?
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.480]   Can't Google learn now that playing with phone companies gets you in trouble?
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.360]   It's always bad.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.240]   I hate whenever something like this happens everyone's like, "Oh, how open is this?"
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:35.560]   Everyone's going to take that word open, kind of throw this back.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:35.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:38.040]   This definition of open.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.360]   Makes me a little crazy.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.560]   There were people talking about this on Howard forums that said,
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:49.240]   at least in the case of Verizon's 4G phones blocking the tethering apps could be in violation
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:58.440]   of open access regulations, section 2720 of title 47, which says, "License is offering service
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:04.280]   on spectrum subject to this section shall not deny, limit or restrict the ability of their
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.160]   customers to use the devices and applications of their choice on the licensee's c-block network."
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:14.120]   In other words, if you sell a device that uses this network, you cannot restrict the ability
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.640]   to use applications of your choice.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:27.320]   Unless it violates the network's technical standards, it violates regulatory compliance,
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.840]   but not just because you don't like it, just because it's tethering.
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:36.360]   Well, I mean, who didn't expect that this would happen?
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:43.000]   Let us, I'm not going to do a royal wedding story, so let's move on.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:52.840]   Let us get our very good about avoiding the royal wedding.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:58.120]   Thank goodness they killed Osama bin Laden and just wiped our memory of Kate and Will's off the face.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.960]   And Donald Trump.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:06.680]   Yeah. Although I had to say I enjoyed him just sitting there simmering during their correspondence
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.720]   dinner, I'm just doing in his own juice.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.080]   And now knowing what was going through Obama's head at that moment.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.320]   Oh man, it's hard to imagine that Obama didn't want to take a little victory lap there, you know?
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.640]   Hey, will you hear what I do tomorrow?
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.680]   Tune in tomorrow.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.680]   Stay tuned. I'm not going to say, I'm not going to say, but you're going to like it.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.160]   You're dealing with meatloaf? I'm getting the worst man on earth.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.240]   Yeah, okay, you know. Donald, you got the hair. I got the guy.
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:44.360]   Time for our tool and tip and number of the week. Let's start with Gina Tripati and her tip of the week.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.640]   Tip of the week. Somebody is listening to Twig. You know, we reported that Google video was
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.080]   shutting down and there was April 29 deadline to download your video.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:59.800]   That April 29 deadline is no longer and there is now an upload video to YouTube option.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:04.360]   They are listening. They are listening. They are listening.
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:09.240]   So you have to create a YouTube account and you log into Google video and then there will be
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:15.160]   options to download and to send to YouTube. So still got time. If you got the most Google video
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:21.160]   clips you want to salvage. This is great. This is fantastic. This is about time.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:27.800]   Though when I search for video, unfortunately on YouTube, I rather on Google itself, it does not go
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.760]   to Google video anymore. It only goes to YouTube. So the beginning of the end is here.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:37.480]   In fact, I don't remember even how to get to Google videos at google.com/video.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.240]   Or video.google.com?
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:45.000]   No, both give me a video search which dumps me into YouTube.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.760]   That's kind of sad. Is anybody gotten the voice? You haven't gotten the voice search.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.120]   No, not yet.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:56.600]   What's that?
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.480]   That's exciting.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.920]   They are adding voice search to web.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.040]   Oh, and the latest builds of Chrome, I think.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:04.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.880]   Oh, it's in a beta. Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.600]   18.5 for speech input.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:13.240]   By the way, I don't even know why they use version numbers anymore in Google Chrome,
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.000]   but we are at 11 all of a sudden.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.800]   They turned up to 11.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:21.880]   Our number, that is not our number of the week.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.760]   Well, it's not.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:25.480]   And Jeff's got the number of the week.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.080]   100 billion, you can guess what that is pretty easily.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:35.880]   Evidently, that's the guest number now for the valuation when Facebook goes out for IPO sometime
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.680]   next year, that the revenue will justify that.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.120]   Folks are telling the Wall Street Journal,
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:45.960]   "It's profit is growing at a rate fast enough to justify a valuation of 100 billion or more
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:46.840]   when it goes public."
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.720]   Holy come, holy.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.920]   And it's probably, or more, it's probably really the number or more.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.080]   So that would value Zuckerberg's personal fortune at $28 billion.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:04.840]   You know, he's going to be worth $28 billion before he hits 28 years old.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.920]   That's the new club.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.000]   You have more billions than your aid.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.800]   If you could be in that club too.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.160]   What is Gates worth?
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.080]   I think it's used to be $32 billion.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:17.800]   I don't know what it is.
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.960]   It's a lot.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.160]   You know.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.040]   An awful lot.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:24.840]   What does it matter?
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:25.560]   What does it matter?
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.160]   My tool of the week actually is stripped from the headlines.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.560]   And I thought a fascinating story.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:37.080]   You remember Uber Media, which is Bill Gross's company that's been buying up Twitter clients.
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:41.880]   They own Twitteroid, which was for a long time my favorite on Android, a really great client,
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.760]   and a few others.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.760]   And as a result, own something like 11% of all the tweet traffic.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:53.560]   Tried a few months ago to buy tweet deck, which would give them a significant portion of all
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.360]   of Twitter's traffic.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:16:02.200]   20% and give them an opportunity to some think, do their own as someone rumored, do their own
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:02.600]   Twitter.
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:08.360]   You know, if you've got the client, you can always kind of phase it in, say, well, you can use our
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:13.880]   client to use Twitter or Uber Twitter, your choice, or do both.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.000]   And that's kind of a very nice transition point.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   So I think it's widely agreed that when Twitter came along and offered twice as much, 40 to 50
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   million dollars for tweet deck, that was purely defensive that they have no intention of doing
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:29.800]   anything with it.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.160]   I hope they don't kill it because it's my tool of the week.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.920]   I immediately downloaded after reading this story and try it.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:37.400]   And you know what?
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.280]   I love it.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:44.040]   It has some really nice features on the Android phone, one of which it keeps all your tweets
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.000]   over a period of time.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.440]   So you can go way back in time and see if the topic actually gives the time.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:53.000]   So if I want to go back in time and find out, for instance, what people were tweeting when
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:00.360]   they found out Osama bin Laden had been caught, I can actually go back to that time after a limited
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:00.680]   period.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.480]   It'll cash, I know this is cashy, 23 megabytes.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:08.120]   It also has the famous tweet deck columns, but you do it by sliding left or right.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.360]   Now you need a fast phone.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:15.400]   In fact, I suspect because this is a Tegra 2, it's a very fast phone and it still feels a
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.360]   little bit sluggish.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:20.440]   I suspect this might not be something you'd want to use on a regular phone.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.880]   I've been using tweet deck in Chrome.
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.080]   It's fantastic.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:28.920]   In fact, you might want to take a look at that as well.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:33.400]   I'll show you real quickly if I go to the, I guess I have to sign into my account.
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.720]   I'll do it over here.
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:41.400]   It's a really nice client in the Chrome browser using HTML5.
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:44.440]   I'm going to be very disappointed if Twitter kills this.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.320]   This is actually maybe the best Twitter client I've ever used.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:51.080]   The Chrome version, the Android version has some really nice features.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:56.280]   And when you log into your tweet deck account, it populates it with all the accounts that
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.920]   you've set it up with in the first place.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:03.800]   So I only have to set these accounts up once on one device and then it automatically
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.880]   populates these accounts onto my other devices and the column settings and all of that stuff.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.560]   Yeah, I really like that feature.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:13.000]   You know, interesting tweet deck is also a Facebook client and a Buzz client and a
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:13.720]   four square client.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:17.880]   So Twitter is essentially buying a client that interfaces with a lot of their competitors.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.280]   I think they're going to, I have to think they're going to kill it.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:20.520]   Yes.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.720]   So here's my Buzz stream.
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:25.800]   Here's my Facebook stream and you can see you can even divide it into groups.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.200]   So it's a good way of managing Facebook groups.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.320]   I don't use LinkedIn anymore, but it supports LinkedIn.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.280]   There's my four square.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.960]   You're right. And these become columns in a larger view.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.440]   I just love it in Chrome.
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:41.720]   I think everybody should try and Chrome, but it's even a great Android.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:47.320]   My only concern is that in Android, you might find it's a little sluggish because it is a
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.600]   tight, tiny bit sluggish on my dual core process.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:50.920]   Yes.
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:56.200]   I'm filled with conflict of interest here because I'm a nano investor in Uber media.
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.560]   Well, I love Bill Gross.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.520]   I think it's a genie.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.800]   Bill Gross is just great.
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:04.840]   But with that huge caveat, that grain of salt the size of Utah,
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.920]   is there an antitrust issue here?
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.960]   It does seem like a very anti-competitive thing to do.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:16.360]   I don't see how you could regulate it because they consume a certain amount of,
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:21.160]   well, they must, I mean, did Bill ever say I'm going to compete with Twitter?
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:27.240]   Right. Well, it's the irony of this open world where Twitter creates this ecosystem and then
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:29.800]   sides, well, you don't want to second thought. We don't like that so much.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.920]   Yeah. I mean, it's a very anti-competitive move.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:37.000]   It says, well, you know, but I think this happens all the time in business.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.240]   We had Michael Robertson on last week and he told a horrific story about mp3.com.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:49.080]   Remember, that was his service where you would put your DVD or other your CD, music CDs in your CD,
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.160]   ROM drive. The computer would generate a code. It would tell mp3.com and they'd say,
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:57.320]   yeah, okay, you've verified you own this. You don't have to upload it. You don't have to rip it.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:04.920]   We'll just store it for you on the cloud. Universal sued them and won completely depressing the
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:12.440]   stock price for mp3.com and then bought it. And at the, Robertson told the story that at the
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:22.280]   closing dinner, he was sitting next to Edgar Bronfman and Bronfman said, basically said,
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:26.920]   yeah, we figured we just sue you. There's no merit to the case, but we just sue you. We
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:29.880]   knew you couldn't defend it. It'd depress your stock price and we'd snap you up.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:36.280]   Put you out of business. And Michael says now having been around for a few years more,
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:43.560]   this is very common. And he says, a lot of what you see in litigation isn't about really,
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:47.720]   about intellectual property. It's about putting the other guy out of business.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:55.480]   Or if you've got 50 million lying around, I mean, I can understand why they would do that.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:01.080]   They don't want Uber media to start a Twitter competitor. You and I might. I'd love to see a
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:09.480]   Twitter competitor, especially one that had some network effect numbers.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:17.240]   I thank you for being here. Jeff Jarvis, he is the professor of journalism at the City
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:24.520]   University of New York, CUNY and the author of what would Google do his blog since 2001,
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:31.880]   Buzzmachine.com. Go there to read his first and listen to his first posts, posts 9/11.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:38.040]   Gina Tripani is on the phone with us from Brooklyn. She is a blogger at smarter word.org
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:42.600]   and is in person powerless. She ha ha. No power. No power.
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:48.040]   I think for putting up with me while I was power cord. Gina, we don't care. It's kind of the
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:53.240]   acoustic Gina. Yeah, we don't care how we get you. It's Gina unplugged. I don't like flying blind.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.000]   I got to say, I like to look at you guys all we do to show. So I look forward to
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:05.080]   making funny faces at you now. Oh, next week I get Leo live at Google I/O.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:09.400]   I'm excited. Oh, I'm done. I do. I am. I'm going to rub it in. I'm rubbing it in.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:15.560]   We'll be our coverage of Google I/O starts 9am on Tuesday. A little less than a week hence.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:19.720]   And we'll also cover Wednesday morning and of course on Twig. So we'll see you then.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:26.680]   We do this show every Wednesday at 1pm Pacific. That's 4pm Eastern time live. Twit.tv and you can
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:30.760]   watch it live or you can download it after the fact. We have audio and video versions of the
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:39.320]   show available at TWIT.tv/Twig. Thank you everybody. See you next time on this week in Google.
