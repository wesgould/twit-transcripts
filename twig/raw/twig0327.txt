[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   It's time for Twink this weekend Google Jeff Jarvis is here along with Kevin Marks.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.640]   The new Google Plus is here.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.640]   Some people say, "Ew."
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.200]   We'll talk about that in a lot more.

[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.040]   Episode 327 recorded Wednesday November 18, 2015.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.640]   Google Non-Plus.

[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.840]   It's time for Twig this weekend Google show where we cover really.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.840]   A whole hell of a lot more than Google, Facebook, Twitter and whatever is on our mind.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   When you have smart panelists like Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   talking about this stuff, you just let it go.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.840]   You pull the string and let it go.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840]   You have no control. You have no hope. You have no sense.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840]   There is no order in the universe.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840]   No, I celebrate it. I want it to go off the rails.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.840]   That's what I look forward to every week.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   That's what we specialize in.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   Also joining us, an excellent engineer when it's coming to driving off the track.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.840]   Mr. Kevin Marks.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.840]   KevinMarks.com.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.840]   I'll just be the conductor in the back going,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.840]   "Where are we going?"
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.840]   Welcome.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.840]   Good to see you both.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.840]   We had a great pre-show conversation about books and health and all sorts of stuff.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.840]   But let's talk right away about Google+, they changed the plus on us.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.840]   Actually, I don't think any of us have the new one.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.840]   I have it at my desktop.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.840]   I got it on my desktop.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.840]   I don't know how you get it.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   They said in the blog post, when you sign in to Google+, you will get an opt-in announcement.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.840]   Well, maybe I ought to sign out there.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.840]   I'm going to try that.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.840]   Oh, should I sign out and sign in?
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.840]   Try it.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   Let me show you the workaround that Lisa found, which is the strangest thing in the world.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.840]   She needs to be a little busier.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.840]   This is the old Google+, and you'll know because if you have the old plus,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.840]   you'll still have the drop-down button that says "Home" with a little house on it.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.840]   That's going to be replaced in the new Google+, with a hamburger menu.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   Go to Settings.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   I just logged in on it and it showed me the new Google+.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.840]   So, logout login.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.840]   I didn't get that.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.840]   Manage Google+ activity.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.840]   Click in the search menu and all of a sudden, boom, you get the new Google+, but it's a temporary change.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.840]   I clicked it and said, "Let's go."
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   All right, so let me logout and log in again.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   That would be...
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.840]   There we go.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840]   Did you just sign out?
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   Is that all you did?
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   I just loaded the page and then the dialogue popped up.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   I've seen...
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.840]   No, I've been trying that over and over.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840]   Well, congratulations.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.840]   If I've got to wait as long for this as I've had...
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.840]   I'm still waiting for Marsh Friggin' Mellow.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.840]   Marsh Friggin' Mellow.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.840]   What is it all about?
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   What is it all about?
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.840]   Yeah, it was like end of October.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.840]   Marsh Friggin' Mellow.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.840]   You're talking about your Nexus 6, right?
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.840]   Well, no, you have my old Nexus 6 and my Nexus 7, too.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.840]   I have the new 6P, so I've got it on that.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.840]   I don't have Marsh Mellow on my other devices.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.840]   It's killing me anyway.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.840]   Well, as you now know, it's not worth worrying about.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.840]   It's not that big of a difference.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.840]   Now on tap is a cool idea.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   Now, see that whatever that is did not work for me.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   I still have the old...
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   I logged out and logged back in again.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.840]   I'm still old Google+ing.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.840]   But boy, you'd think that...
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   You'd think that...
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.840]   Here, I've got mine.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.840]   It was the second coming of...
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.840]   Oh, shit.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.840]   Adolf Hitler or something.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   Like, they have ruined...
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.840]   What have they done to my Google, Ma?
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.840]   All right, so here it is.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.840]   That's what it looks like.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.840]   All right, go back and forth between mine and yours,
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.840]   just real quickly, so you can see old Google...
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.840]   I got one column because I've made the window now, right?
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.840]   New Google.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.840]   New Google has a big red bar across the top.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.840]   Material design?
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.840]   It's material.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.840]   All right.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.840]   And also, they've done a huge amount of work on making the website
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   fast and responsive.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840]   That was the other big thing there.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.840]   Well, in fact, huge amounts of...
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.840]   I mean, the size of the pages has gone down dramatically.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.840]   So good.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   So rewritten from scratch, right?
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.840]   Lots of animations and new places.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.840]   What do people not like about the new Google+,?
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   Well, I don't see it so much of a change.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.840]   There's more emphasis on collections and communities.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   Okay.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   The posts look the same.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   So I just put the link to the image I got on the...
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.840]   in the chat.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.840]   Okay.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.840]   The honestly.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.840]   All right.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   So this is...
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.840]   you got the sign-in.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.840]   So basically, when I went to plus Google...
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.840]   Yeah, that's what I want.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.840]   I got that little thing that's...
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.840]   Meet the new Google+, now thanks for the transition.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.840]   No, I had the chance of the transition.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   But yeah, there was a post about how they...
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.840]   how they've redeveloped it, which I should be able to find on Google+, didn't I?
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.840]   It was a plus post, as a matter of fact.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   Um...
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   But basically, they've...
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.840]   they've rethought the way they did it and built it from scratch.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.840]   And they've been...
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.840]   It was actually been on the mobile web for a while.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.840]   They said, "If you go to...
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.840]   on your mobile device, you'll get this new updated version."
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.840]   But they've just rolled out to the desktop as well.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.840]   What?
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   I thought they said that it will be out soon on iOS and Android.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.840]   No, no, it's on the web.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.840]   They haven't changed the apps yet.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.840]   I think.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.840]   Right.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   So you're saying, "If I go to plus.google.com in Chrome on my mobile..."
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.840]   Yes.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.840]   I will get a mobile...
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.840]   Actually, I'm going to try and Firefox.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.840]   Let me just see.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.840]   That's interesting.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   Okay.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   So, plus.google.com.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.840]   There's your shot.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   I've been using Firefox on Android because the Firefox mobile Firefox supports all the plugins
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   that desktop Firefox supports.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.840]   Including...
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.840]   Yes, okay, I think that's true.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.840]   That is the new Google+.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   The app or just the web on it?
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.840]   Not the app, the web on.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.840]   Not the login, though, which is kind of a pain in the behind.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.840]   So, it's architected to be more lightweight.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.840]   And that would make sense.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:23.840]   That's why the mobile version of it has been using this for a while.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.840]   What else?
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.840]   Here, actually, can you hand this to me?
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.840]   That's the new app.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.840]   No, I'm doing it here.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.840]   Oh, do you get the new app?
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.840]   I got the new app.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.840]   Yes, I have the new app.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   Oh!
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.840]   Well, maybe I'll have that, too.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.840]   I'm all shot at it.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.840]   I mean, I had to, you know...
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.840]   What are you, so I did?
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   Yes, I said later.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.840]   And their police has their APK...
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.840]   Whatever.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.840]   They've pissed the APK on their post.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.840]   Lauren Weinstein is complaining about grade type for bad-off or older eyes.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.840]   But other than that, I don't see.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.840]   Well, I got the oldest eyes there are and them bother me.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   Yeah, you want to keep the...
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.840]   You do want to keep the screen pressed.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.840]   I'll need to do my fingerprint.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   There you go.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   [laughter]
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.840]   Okay, so that's the new app.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   And the main difference is, at least in the Android app, is that bottom row, which I do not like at all.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   Oh, no, it's communities' notifications.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.840]   I just don't like that.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   Otherwise, so the presentation is very similar.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   I heard some people complaining about the way the comments, but the comments have always rolled through.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.840]   Oh, yeah, they've always done that.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.840]   So I just checked on my Android and there is a new Google+ update.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:43.840]   Ah, now if you update that and it doesn't refresh it automatically, you can go into your app settings and, like, you know, delete the data.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.840]   And then the next time you load it, it'll give you the refresh.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.840]   But it says, "What's new pin post in your collection?"
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   So collections are basically...
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   Collections is basically Pinterest-clotterns, isn't it?
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   That's what it's called like to me.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.840]   Well, they've had those for a while, haven't they?
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.840]   They've had it for a while, yeah.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.840]   It was fast for a while, yeah.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   Now they're just putting it in front of them.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.840]   They just made it more like upfront.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.840]   Well, I won't join any collections.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   They've had this in the mobile web for a while.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   They've just made the desktop web be the same as the mobile web.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   But that post about how they did it, so they've basically really stripped it down.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:23.840]   So it's gone from 22 megs to 327 kilobytes, the homepage weight,
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.840]   which is pretty impressive.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.840]   Yeah, massive difference.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.840]   Well, this is Google AMP, too.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   It's the religion.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.840]   They're going to enforce all over.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.840]   But it's...
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   Go ahead.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.840]   You go.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   Sorry, it was gapping then.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.840]   Yes, so it's very much the religion of how to do it.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.840]   But one of the things they say in this one is that it's, you know,
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.840]   AMP is all... has a sort of very high JavaScript component.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.840]   This one, they said one of the design principles was that they wanted to be able to render stuff
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.840]   either on the server or the client.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   So they can give you a solid server side version and serve that to you
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.840]   and then update it with new stuff on the client.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.840]   So that is a big architectural rewrite.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   Does that smart idea?
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   So there is this trend towards doing web pages that are basically
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.840]   all JavaScript in the HTML that isn't really there at all.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   And that is probably the answer.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   That's not AMP.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.840]   And it restricts JavaScript to a minimum, right?
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.840]   No, AMP requires you to use only their JavaScript.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.840]   Google AMP, okay.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   So unless they fix it since since,
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.840]   if JavaScript fails to load on AMP, you get a white screen.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.840]   Oh.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   Because for some reason, for some reason,
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   there's so much JavaScript.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.840]   There's so much JavaScript.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.840]   That's funny.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.840]   And my point was really, you make the more sophisticated technical point.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   I was just making the dumb point that Google's religion of fast pages
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   were really seeing come out here in a lot of different ways.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.840]   Absolutely.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.840]   That points that point.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.840]   That point is right.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.840]   The people who are the most avid Google+ users,
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.840]   like Lauren Weinstein, who you quote...
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.840]   Who's great.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.840]   He's wonderful.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.840]   Hate it.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.840]   Do you think this change to Google+ is going to be a positive for Google+.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.840]   Will it bring people back to it?
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.840]   Or is it going to further chase people away?
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.840]   I don't see...
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   Listen, I think Bradley and company are brilliant.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.840]   We love them.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.840]   But if I were going to say to somebody,
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   you know, as somebody who's defended Google+,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.840]   even though I've kind of abandoned it to be all honest.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.840]   Right.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.840]   But I've defended it since the beginning.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.840]   If I went to somebody and now they say,
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.840]   "Your Google+ thing, what's new about it?
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.840]   Should I try it again?"
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.840]   I wouldn't know what to say.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.840]   Well, they got a hamburger now.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.840]   I don't think it's that different.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.840]   I don't think so either.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.840]   I don't think so.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.840]   They're going to...
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   You know, the thing, the principle is that they've got a flow of things
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.840]   that shows in the page and they decide which ones to show you
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.840]   and you can search for them and so on.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.840]   Right.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   And the actual contents of them hasn't changed much at all, I don't think.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   I'm only seeing two Lauren posts playing.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   I wouldn't say he did.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.840]   I think it was...
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.840]   Well, but those two posts, he's pretty adamant about hating it.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.840]   It was nearly the contrast.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.840]   But I'll tell you what about Elgin, what's the God of Google+?
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.840]   I think Mike likes it a lot.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   Yeah, he's big.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.840]   He's big on it.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.840]   Yep.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.840]   He says it's a huge improvement.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.840]   Certainly fast.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.840]   He's saying it's different.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.840]   It loads so fast.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   I mean, I think everybody's observing that, right?
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.840]   I don't think collections are that interesting, to be honest with you.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   No, I don't either.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.840]   I'm so disappointed that Google's put those front and center.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.840]   And I'm not making any collections, as you can see.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.840]   Flipboard does this.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.840]   Pinterest does this.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:56.840]   A lot of sites think, but it's too much work, frankly, to make collections.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.840]   Well, it depends.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.840]   I've joined a lot of communities.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   I participate in communities.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   Yeah, I like those.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   I mean, we make collections for this show.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.840]   We just put them in a spreadsheet.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   True.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.840]   True.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.840]   Okay.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.840]   I don't do that.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.840]   It was too much work, but I should be clear that Jason does that.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.840]   I also have collections on my Google Plus post.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.840]   Do you?
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.840]   I'm a collection.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.840]   We hired the right guy.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:31.160]   So when you do collections, you're going through the homepage and then you're adding it to your
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.840]   collection by clicking that share button?
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.480]   No, I mean, how do you collect something?
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.240]   I mean, actually, to be honest, I don't follow collections necessarily.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.480]   I follow people.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.640]   It's confusing, right?
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.960]   Because it's like, collections is basically a way of saying, you like me, but you don't
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.960]   like the things I say about this.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.640]   So instead, follow the things I say about this.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.400]   So in other words, I've got an Android collection.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.960]   Most of the stuff I post on Google Plus is Android, so it goes in the Android collection.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.400]   How do you make it go in the Android collection?
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.360]   It kind of does that by default because it remembers the last place I posted, which
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.360]   is in my Android collection.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.960]   So you post to a collection?
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.960]   Yes.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.960]   And so anybody following me in the Android collection sees those posts.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.760]   Most people also post into your stream and your profile.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.560]   Yeah, it's all going to my profile.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.160]   Do you see it whether you're following me?
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.880]   If you're following me, yes, you see everything that I do, including my collections that have
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.160]   nothing to do with Android or that are in a different collection.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.360]   If you're just following my Android collection, that's all you're going to see from my post.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.600]   It's confusing to add taxonomy or to put them as requiring users to add taxonomy to what
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.600]   they do on social.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   It's a lot.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   It's a lot.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600]   It's a lot.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.600]   It's completely agreed.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   It's worked when it's taxed.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.120]   There was this distinction between tagging and categorization.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.520]   And categorization is hard because it requires you to think about the world and divide into
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.520]   categories.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.080]   And then every time you've got something like which box do I put this in?
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.040]   Tagging is easy because you have a thing and you say, what works this remind me of?
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.840]   And you put hashes in front of them.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.840]   It's that minute.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.840]   There you go.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.680]   I'm trying to create.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.800]   I'll just put some terrible picture in there.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.280]   I don't know why.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280]   It's me.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   It's me.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.280]   Okay.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.000]   I'm trying to create a tech news thing.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.080]   So people that have used circles automatically follow this collection.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.680]   Okay, you could turn that on.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.160]   So now, how do I make stuff?
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.360]   How do I show it's only post that I make?
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.360]   Yes.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.760]   So you're creating collections that people have followed you.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.440]   You could just follow your things that fall into that category.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.640]   So let's make a post.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.320]   So when you make a post, it says, where do you want to post this?
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.320]   Do you want to post this in a collection?
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.320]   Or do you want to post it?
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.320]   I see.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   It says tech news.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   You can see it.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.320]   Or do you want to post it?
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.320]   And you could choose another one.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.320]   But then somebody has to follow your collection separate from you.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.520]   No, because by default, they can be in both.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.520]   Well, that's what it said.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.120]   It said, would you like everybody who follows you to see this?
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.360]   Oh, I said yes.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.720]   No, and you can make them fully public or you can make them restricted to circles.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.240]   So he's got the same commission modal as everything else.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:07.200]   It was like a couple of months ago, I posted just public, just a couple of songs, John Lennon
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.640]   songs that I love.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.000]   And then somebody in the comments was like, I really don't care to know what music you
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   listen to.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Could you make a music collections?
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.720]   And then I don't follow that.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.720]   So this sounds like cool.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   So now I do that.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   This is mostly negative.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.360]   Like, I don't want that stuff.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.880]   Could you put that somewhere?
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.880]   I know.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.440]   I wasn't at Mark Zuckerberg to say people don't want to make lists.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:34.200]   And frankly, that's what Google+ kind of went wrong with this whole, I liked it initially,
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.120]   this idea of circles, but it was too much work.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.120]   I never used to.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.120]   I just did it to everybody.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.120]   Right.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.640]   So I think it's a tempest in a teapot as somebody's saying, why are you spending so
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.640]   much time talking about this?
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.360]   No one's going to care next week.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.360]   It's Google.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.360]   It's our show.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.440]   Well, the interesting thing for me is the change in the web development.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.440]   That's the best part.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.120]   That's the part that I set up in.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.560]   Is this officially an AMP page?
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.760]   Well, that's it.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   I think--
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.760]   That's what Kevin's saying.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.760]   It's not an AMP page, no.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.640]   But what it is, I think what it is, is it's following the pattern that they talked about
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.240]   at Chrome, their fest, whatever it was called this week.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.440]   Where they're-- I'm trying to remember what they have, what they're jogging.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.000]   Basically, they've got this model of building apps using the browser.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.720]   They've got a name for it, progressive web apps or something.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:33.400]   So the idea is that you-- by using new browser feature called service workers, you can have
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:39.040]   a thing that is able to run code in the background on your machine, even if that web page isn't
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.040]   open and receive notifications, then wake your web page up.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.600]   And it also means that it could work offline.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:53.920]   The way of setting up cache is so that your-- if you go to your URL once and cache staff,
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:59.200]   and then if you go to that URL again, even if you're not connected, you can get some
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.200]   of the content.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.200]   They're all previous content that's been cached.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.880]   And potentially create stuff as well.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.960]   So there's a big-- Google is doing a big push on this.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.800]   The Chrome team is doing a big push on this.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.680]   Firefox has it partly implemented.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.680]   It's in the developer version.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.600]   It's not in the full release version, whereas in Chrome, it's in the release version.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.520]   And Apple has it on their five-year plan.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.760]   It's like five years for this.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.760]   Yes, exactly.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.160]   Well, iOS is a bit like that anyway.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.400]   It's like, well, you've got a new browser when you get a new phone.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.880]   Well, other people get a new phone.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.240]   Well, there'll be a new version of the OS.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:43.640]   But so Safari updates tend to come in big lumps with lots of things when they're releasing
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:50.360]   new OSes, whereas the Chrome and Firefox update every six weeks and so new stuff flows in
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.360]   continually.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.160]   And I have to say, the new Google+ does load very, very quickly, right?
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.160]   Yes.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.640]   That's nice.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.040]   I think there's bigger news that just happened after this came out.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.040]   OK.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.080]   Which is the app streaming.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.080]   What's that?
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.080]   Oh, OK, look down.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.080]   This is a big deal.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.080]   This is a very big deal.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   Look at Danny's article.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.920]   It's very long but very clear.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.240]   What it amounts to is this.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.960]   When you go to search and you have information that you want from an app for apps that have
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:25.160]   agreed to do this with Google, even without having that app on your phone, Google will
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:32.360]   stream that app into a web page out of the search results so you can get the content.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.560]   So this opens up the content of an app to Google search number one.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.880]   And number two, it opens up that content to you without having to download the app.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.080]   So it's the web fighting back against the app world.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.880]   So the example they give is a hotels tonight app where you go and you search for, unfortunately,
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.320]   it's not out there yet.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.240]   You search for hotels tonight in Phoenix.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.480]   And right now it says, hey, would you like to download the app?
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:00.320]   Instead in this world, it'll say, click here and in that image, you will just go to the
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.600]   same content as if you had the hotels tonight app and it will be there.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:11.960]   Well, OK, does the app developer have to go along for the ride on this one?
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.960]   Yes.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.080]   Well, so far, yes, there's a limited number of tests.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.280]   I could see people saying, well, that's we made the app so that you would have to get
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.280]   the app.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.280]   Well, maybe you still have the option to get the app.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.920]   This is a sampling way to get the app.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.640]   The problem with or eliminate the new for the apps.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.280]   So how are they getting the sample?
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.640]   How does one do that?
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.640]   There's hooks.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.120]   I'm sure there's an API that gives Google the hook in so that they can search the content
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   that is behind that app.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.880]   Now, we're starting in a dark web, you know, in the light.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.960]   Yeah, I love this idea because that's, of course, apps are a walled garden and exactly.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:54.280]   So this is really interesting to me.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   There's the list.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:02.720]   Hotel tonight, Weather Channel, Chamonix, Gourmet, My Horoscope, Visual Anatomy Free,
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.000]   Useful Knots, what a collectical list, Daily Horoscope.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.760]   So you got two horoscope apps and the New York subway.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:16.320]   If you go to Danny's Twitter feed, he has a little tiny vine showing what he did on it.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.320]   Is that this?
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.320]   No, it's a different one.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   Something else?
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   Okay.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.200]   Well, so just another indication of it in practice.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.240]   So I wonder if Google's got like the apps running in some lab somewhere.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.400]   How would they do this?
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.400]   This is interesting.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.360]   Well, it's launched the Google Play app and runs the app through that app.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.920]   So it is effectively downloading the APK.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.280]   But it also, yeah, Kevin, but it also has to be able to search, but it's also searching
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.360]   it is scraping and returning results.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.360]   Search results.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.360]   Right.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.360]   App indexing.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.360]   Yeah, there's two different things happening.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.760]   Well, that's part of the, what do you call it?
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.760]   The thing that they've forgotten in M that's like making sense of the app, right?
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.760]   Yeah, app indexing.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.760]   It's looking into the app.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.760]   So it's part of the now on tap.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.280]   Now on tap, Bodel, that's, I'm going to read what Google was.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:16.280]   And also, man, it was, I think it was last year a company called Agawi was, was snapped
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.840]   up by Google that hat was developing technology to do just this, basically virtual versions
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.080]   of a lot of tech crunch.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.720]   Google's been indexing the contents of mobile apps for two years.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.720]   Jesus.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.280]   But they're just now making that information available.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.720]   Thousands of apps have already been indexed.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.920]   So this is kind of making the app contents part of the knowledge.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.080]   Well, and it's also part of it.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.640]   It's also to me, again, I'm going to speak at a high level, not the knowledgeable level.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.880]   Kevin speaks out, but I see a similarity between this and instant articles at AMP in
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:55.120]   the sense that it just makes, you're not going to a web, you're not loading a browser
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.120]   to go to a website.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.960]   You're not loading an app to go to that.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:04.200]   The content feels like it comes to you.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.880]   Well, isn't, I think this is what we want.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.080]   I just wonder about app developers, how they feel about it.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.520]   To my mind, app development, you know, they should like it.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.880]   They should because the difficulty of getting people to download and remember to use your
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.120]   app A, B, the impossibility of getting anyone to discover what's in your app through search.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.120]   Right.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.040]   Now, of course, we're going to hear antitrust stuff about, oh, well, Google's taking it
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.840]   over and they're streaming it and they're in control of it, you know, and there's maybe
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   a few issues.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.240]   You know, if Google did this with Twitch podcasts, you did a search and all of a sudden it said,
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.840]   yeah, and they also talked about this on this week in Google and they put up a little
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.600]   player that jumped to that part.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.920]   Boy, I would love that.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.560]   Because it's a sampling, yeah.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.560]   It's a discovery.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.360]   And you may well choose to download the, I mean, there should be an app opportunity.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.280]   There are reasons, you know, I have the New York Times app because it caches the whole
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.440]   days New York Times before I get on the train in the morning.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.000]   So that's reason for me to have that app right there, right?
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.320]   Guardian, same thing.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   So there are apps that I do indeed want, but frankly, very few of them.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.560]   This opens up a huge amount of that world.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.200]   Now the question is what is, you know, what do you do with something like Facebook?
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.800]   You search Google for Facebook and, you know, if it doesn't play long, I guess they don't
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   do it or I don't remember.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.640]   Do you remember yesterday's Wall Street Journal article?
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.720]   Google gets surprise ally and mobile app search push.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.920]   I'll try them.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.760]   So I think nobody really knew what was going on here.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.800]   Facebook on Friday began allowing Google to crawl and index its mobile app.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.440]   Oh, I didn't see this.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.880]   Agreement means results from Google searches on smartphones will display this some content
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.680]   from Facebook's app, including public profile information.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.120]   The listings will appear as deep links.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.600]   It'll take users to the relevant part of the Facebook app.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.720]   So of course, this is good for Facebook.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:25:00.400]   It may not be so good for your privacy, but if you're posting publicly on Facebook, you
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:05.760]   really might want to think about, you know, what do I want to post publicly on Facebook?
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.240]   Well, that's been the true Facebook for a while.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.240]   Of course.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   Of course.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.240]   Facebook index is it.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.240]   Right.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.400]   And Facebook added their search a couple of weeks ago.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.400]   So this is interesting.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.040]   Well, they changed that, sir, because they used to have that sort of graph based search
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.520]   that let you say, find me friends of mine who work for this company.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.920]   Right, which nobody ever used.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.520]   Done that and gone for public stuff.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.960]   I mean, to me, what happens here is in this combination of things.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.320]   So I've got an extra 30 for you.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   I just put in the IOS.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   Yeah, I saw it.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.160]   Let me pull it up.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.240]   Installing things has gotten so fast and painless.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.560]   Why not skip it entirely and make a phone that already has every app, quote, installed
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.360]   already and just downloads and runs them on the fly.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.600]   I felt really clever until I realized I'd invented web pages.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.600]   Oops.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.240]   Actually, there is.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.840]   What is that mint phone that was a Kickstarter's coming out next month or in January?
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.440]   I already talked about next bit.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.440]   Next bit.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.240]   That it takes stuff off of your phone if you don't use it and then it streams it back
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   when you need it.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.520]   I think, I mean, the notion of a web page and a website and the notion of an app.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.760]   It really starts to get whooshy here.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.000]   Well, it should because that's a show.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.200]   I really didn't like the move.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.680]   And you're a, you know, like, let's Kevin Marks.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.320]   I mean, you're the open web advocate.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   Is this a good thing?
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.480]   Well, I think this is interesting because this combines with the progressive web apps
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.360]   stuff I was saying, which they're a question from the other end and they're saying, okay,
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.040]   here's where developing apps that run in the browser, but on Android will feel much more
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.040]   like apps.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.640]   You can, they will give you an install, install this on your desktop prompt.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.880]   They will work in the background.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.600]   They will get notifications.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.200]   They will appear in that new web view that has less web craft around it and browser craft
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.680]   around it.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.200]   So they're coming it from that direction.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.960]   And this is interesting because they're coming from the office iteration.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.920]   They're saying, okay, there's a bunch of stuff that's only in apps and it will be nice
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.080]   people to search them.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.840]   So I think I'm not sure this is, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's just more like
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.640]   culturally Google approaches this things with the sense of the web.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:20.640]   And so the different teams are coming at it from different angles.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.880]   It's a good thing for content creators for sure.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.320]   It's good thing for Facebook.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:33.400]   And it travel your content as with AMP your content travels with your, what your circumstances,
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.720]   your, your business model attached to it.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.200]   If that's advertising, it's, it's there.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.120]   If it's, if it's transactional as in the hotel example, it's there.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:47.600]   Um, you know, I worked with the company called reposted us, which unfortunately isn't, isn't
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.720]   here, but, but John Pettit is a brilliant guy.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.320]   He was the founder of it.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.840]   I was working with him to embed content, which I've talked about the show in the past
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.480]   a lot, which is a kind of primitive version of what's happening now.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.160]   But he also found that embedded transactional units, hotel units, things like that work
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160]   extremely well.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.440]   If they're in context and right there when you want them and, and, and this makes it, this
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.560]   is much more user centered and much less media and brand centered.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:18.880]   That gets very confusing for us in media because, you know, if somebody comes in and
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.760]   they see your Andy, we're interview with that at that minute, you know, 36, right?
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.480]   Do they know that it occurred on triangulation?
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.720]   They'd know it's Twitter network.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.360]   That's, that's part of the issue you're going to do.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.720]   It looks like the app's well branded that you'd see, you know, this came from hotels
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.600]   tonight.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.320]   Obviously Google'd have to do that.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.320]   They don't want to.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.480]   They, I mean, I would be upset if Google were extracting our content for their benefit.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.120]   Well, the other opportunity here, that's what they've done with the web forever, isn't
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   it?
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.440]   Like they've, they've crawled the web and they pull out SERPs and they, and the, the
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.120]   process for that is somewhat opaque.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:57.320]   You can influence a bit by marking up certain ways, but basically they'll, they'll decide
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.800]   which piece they show and in what order.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.080]   And they're doing here, they'll be doing that for the apps as well.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   They decide which ones they think are relevant based on their AI magic.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.600]   But it'll, it'll pop up with information from the, the inside the app as well.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.160]   So it's not quite clear.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.160]   What they're doing, I need to find a real, real tech discussion on this.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.080]   It sounds like what they're doing is actually running the app.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.640]   Yeah, they'd have to, would they?
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.600]   Actually, actually running the app, but running it, but loading, loading it piecemeal.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.600]   So they basically as a virtual.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.080]   Attached in a partial, a partial app.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.880]   Oh, in the search results.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.880]   No, no, no.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:38.800]   It says it, it runs it through the Google Play Store app effectively.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.120]   So it's, it's, that is being given permission.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.880]   That's already got permission to install stuff on your thing and download.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.520]   It's, it runs at a high level permissions, the most other apps.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.880]   So it's able to pull bits in, run them through a bit and then throw them away again, pull
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.880]   the sound away.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.600]   But this doesn't just work on the mobile.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:57.000]   This works, does this, I mean, is this searches everywhere or is it just on your mobile?
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.480]   I thought it said only mobile.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.480]   Ah.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   Well, that's less useful.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.880]   That's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's less, that's less.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.880]   That's a ridiculous distinction to me.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.400]   The problem with Google is, it says, it says, it says with Android apps.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.400]   That makes sense.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:16.200]   If that's the case, if it's only Android apps and only on mobile, then I think you're exact,
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   I think you nailed it, Kevin.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   That's how they're doing it.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.040]   That also makes sense for things like the Pixel C and things, you know, what about, which,
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.480]   which wins, Cardner, and a chat, or mass, an interesting question, all well and good for
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.480]   free apps.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.440]   What about paid apps?
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.320]   Same issue for paid content.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.720]   And I've been part of discussions with paid publishers who say to Google, it stays.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   If a, if a Wall Street Journal subscriber, no, that, not that discussion gets a little
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.720]   bit better.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.080]   When a Wall Street Journal subscriber searches for something on Google search and they come
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.360]   up on Google News either one, right?
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.400]   And there's journal content that's there.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.080]   They've already paid for it.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.880]   Why can't you do them a favor?
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.680]   Because they've already shown the preference for it and give some preference to that.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.760]   And you know, Google doesn't spin at that idea.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.640]   There's not even around the room and, you know, query, queryless looks.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.720]   But that's something that the, that the, that the paywall publishers have always wanted.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:12.320]   So I think that there are ways that it's basically, you know, an in-app purchase in another,
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.440]   in another model.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.200]   There's an option that comes and the user can say, don't show me stuff I haven't paid
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.440]   for or, you know, show it to me.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.760]   Google could get us, could get a sales spiff on causing new sales because this is, this
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.680]   is premium sampling.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.680]   There's all kinds of new, they don't even do it for paywalls yet.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.320]   So having them do it in apps is.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.960]   But they, while they do it to the extent that they will show you paywall content now on
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.960]   Google News.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   I snitched it.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.960]   You just curse when you get there.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.960]   Yeah, they'll literally just snip it.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.960]   You'll curse when you go to, right?
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   Yeah, which is very frustrating.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.880]   Or in the case of the Wall Street Journal, no, you will, if it's through search, you found
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.880]   it, you will have your free.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.880]   Let's do that front door thing with what they call it.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880]   Right.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.520]   So if, and this is, this, what it just me about this so much is because there's potentially
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.000]   an exchange of consumer data, which is what I keep pushing for.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.400]   So if the Wall Street Journal revealed to Google hello, Leo Le Port is one of our dear
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:09.480]   subscribers, please make sure that you give preference to our stuff to him because he's
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.640]   shown that preference because he subscribes.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:15.240]   And Leo at some point you get the chance to say yes to that or don't do that, you know,
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   but, okay, it makes sense logically.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.240]   Um, similarly.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.440]   So I could do that relatively, honestly, just with a cookie.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.440]   If I have a Wall Street Journal cookie set that I'm a paying subscriber, that's all I
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.440]   really need.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.440]   Right.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.480]   But what happens is it's also, it's also a data exchange.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.320]   So now Google knows, oh, this guy's a money guy.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.560]   He likes the Wall Street Journal.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.240]   He always right wing, you know, what are the other, yeah, we don't want that.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.240]   Right.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.360]   And the, the, no politics emails, please people, it's just a joke.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.360]   Come on.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.360]   Coming out.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   You got to read that book about the righteous mind.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.280]   Then you wouldn't say things like that anymore.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.360]   There's a data exchange that occurred there where the, where we're Google learned something
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   about that user.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.640]   And generally what I want, of course, is for the publisher to learn something from, from
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.760]   Google about that user.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.960]   With the user's consent, with the benefit to the user, with transparency to the user,
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.840]   with the opportunity for change for the user, but that kind of data exchange is where the,
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:12.800]   the only real value is in a world that goes from mass to relevance.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.160]   And when you, when you get away from this idea of, well, I'm going to the Wall Street
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.360]   Journal site now is buy honey, I'll see it now, or I'm going to drive off to the journal
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.800]   now and see what their site says.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.360]   If instead you say, oh, I found this journal stuff through search and I found it through
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.000]   Twitter and I found it through here and I found it through there.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.960]   And sometimes I looked at a webpage and sometimes I looked at their app and I don't even know
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   the difference.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.520]   I just got what I wanted.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.000]   That's the way the internet auto operate.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Except for it.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.760]   The web was intended to operate.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.720]   Except for all the people who say, and then then Google's tracking me.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.680]   And well, that's where we've got to come up with new standards about how this occurs.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.800]   And the standards to be are fairly straightforward and simple.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.200]   Number one, there has to be a different benefit to me.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   You don't just gather data on me for the sake of gathering it.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.200]   It's true.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.120]   There has to be a business benefit to you for the same reason.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.080]   You don't just gather data to gather it.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.880]   Three, you give me transparency as to what you're doing and why you're doing it, what
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.880]   you're doing with it.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.440]   And four, you give me some measure of control that I can go in and correct things, which
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.680]   only means that I give you more data about myself.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.400]   And what's wrong with that?
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:20.680]   Under those principles and implicit of that is the option to say, no, don't do this.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.240]   I refuse to, I don't like Google.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.680]   I don't like the Wall Street Journal, whatever.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   That's fine.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.840]   Then you know, it's okay.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.520]   You're going to lose out on some relevance, but that becomes your choice.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.200]   I think that there are ways and principles to do this that become beneficial to everybody
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.400]   in that transaction.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.400]   It may be too late.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.920]   There may be too much mistrust, but I think there's still an opportunity here.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.800]   And to me, it is the crux of new media business models.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.000]   It is the only thing that's going to save us.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.600]   Well, I mean, as you know, you and I don't care about privacy so much, but privacy advocates
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.640]   have a field day with that one.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.480]   We have to come up with some sort of opt-in opt-out.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.920]   Yes, yes, we got to help.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.640]   Do not track has to work.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:08.120]   Well, as the argument, we define one and then the publishers said screw you.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.200]   Yeah, we don't want to use that.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.000]   Now we'll be doing it through force measure, right?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Right.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   We're opting out by running blockers.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Right.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Out of land the shores.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.600]   Oh, drone over Kevin drone coming.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:24.400]   No, I get exactly right because do not track stop, you know, wasn't supported and stop working.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.400]   We went to a block.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   Congratulations.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   Well done.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.480]   Is a howitzer do not track howitzer do not track has no subtlety at all.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.480]   Right.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.320]   It just says everything is old data is evil and if you're watching me, that's bad.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   Well, no.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:40.600]   Um, how many, let me give you an example, example, we're all stuck with with retargeting program,
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.000]   programmatic ads where you look at the boots on Amazon and the boots follow you around forever.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Yes.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.360]   And the interactive advertising bureau said one thing that we should have on those.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:55.040]   Yeah, dads is a frequency cap as a standard because we all get sick of them.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.360]   That's why they do tracking things like that.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   Exactly.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.400]   That's why you have to have the cookie to do the frequency cap.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.800]   And that's a benefit to the user to say we are not going to overload you with those stupid
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   boots.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.760]   We do now we overload you with the boots.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:11.160]   We've done a terrible job in the industry of a terrible, terrible, awful job in all of
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:17.320]   our industries in media, in advertising and technology of giving people some measure of
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.960]   transparency, control and knowledge about what's happening.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.560]   But I don't think it's too late.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.000]   And to me, Kevin, you're exactly right.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.480]   The publishers blew it here because they're the ones who said, we don't know what to
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.440]   that because we're holding on to our ad avail.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.840]   Every precious ad avail we can have.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.240]   But you take publishers, they should be the ones who should be concerned about trust
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.480]   and faith with their users.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.360]   And they should be the ones to work with a Google and Facebook to help set these standards.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:46.040]   I'm going to Google Newsgeist in Phoenix this week tomorrow.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.760]   And I hope that's one of the things we'll talk about because out of Newsgeist came
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.200]   AMP.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.600]   So other good things could come out of it going forward.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.960]   We're going to take a break.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.200]   You should get me on the on the invite list for that.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.960]   I'd like to left you one of those again.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.960]   I know.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   I know.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.960]   Did you you've gone to the news through before?
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.960]   We can use it.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.960]   Yeah, that's basically the reason.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.480]   That's the main food you and I and Marissa did a thing.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.320]   But no, I've actually never been to Newsview.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.160]   Give me a let list, too.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.360]   This is the rechristened news foods.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.960]   When Riley dropped out, it's now Newsgeist.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.960]   Different t-shirts.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.560]   Always up for a new t-shirt.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.840]   Kevin, do you think you could talk about Ethereum?
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.240]   I'm not with a great deal of knowledge.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.240]   It's not something I know in depth.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.320]   I know someone who's asking that.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.320]   I'm trying.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.320]   Yeah, I saw that in the chatroom.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.320]   And I think that's a great subject.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.660]   And you know, I'm trying to get, we're going to take a break, but just trying to get Steve
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.600]   Gibson to do a full show.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.420]   He's done a full show of Bitcoin, but I want him to do a full show on blockchain and other
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.880]   applications for blockchain.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:55.600]   Ethereum is a very interesting application for blockchain.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.800]   I mean, I can at least give us a.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   Two cents on blockchain and says that.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   Kevin, what do you think?
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   I spent time on it.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.080]   What you think is a light bit of knowledge.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.880]   Believe me, it's going to be more than enough.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.880]   It's going to be more than enough.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880]   All right.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.560]   When we come back, lots more to talk about.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.560]   Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.600]   Always a pleasure author of what would Google do?
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:19.120]   Public Parts, Gutenberg, the Geek and Geek Sparing Gifts.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.520]   Buzzmachine.com is his blog.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:25.160]   I'll out in German as Oskidrucht.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.160]   That's it?
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   That's the title.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.960]   I'll practice uncharacteristically short German title.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.680]   Out of print.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.680]   Out of print.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.680]   Oh, I like it.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.680]   That's good.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.640]   Kevin Marks is also here from Kevin Marks.com.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.040]   He's all about IndieWeb.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:45.360]   And I know IndieWebCamp is coming up, so we'll get your IndieWebCamp plug-in soon.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.960]   Also, homebrew website, Club Tonight.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   Yes.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.200]   It's the second anniversary.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.360]   So, really, congratulations.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.200]   That's awesome.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.520]   A show today brought to you by Ring, the Ring Video Doorbell.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.520]   Just the greatest thing.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.360]   Every once in a while, something comes along.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.400]   And I show it to people and they go, "Oh, yeah."
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.720]   And they show it to people and they go, "Oh, yeah."
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:12.120]   And it just spreads like wildfire because it's just, it's such a great, simple idea that's
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.160]   exactly what people need.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.200]   It's kind of like caller ID for your home.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.520]   What it does is it replaces your regular Ding Dong doorbell.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.520]   It's an easy replacement.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.520]   I did it myself.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.680]   You know, a couple of screws, a couple of wires.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.960]   But all of a sudden, and by the way, when you press the button, your doorbell still goes
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.640]   Ding Dong, but not only your doorbell, but your phone, your tablet, your computer, Ding
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.640]   Dong's everywhere.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.240]   It's so awesome.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.240]   You don't even have to have a wired doorbell for this to work.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.800]   You could put it on any door because it's got a one-year lithium-ion battery and it could
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.600]   rechargeable.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.040]   Once you get on there, there's a camera, nice wide-angle camera.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:52.280]   I'll give you a full view of your front stoop and by the way, there's that Ding Dong Dong.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.600]   Love that sound.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.040]   But it also will give you a view of the street beyond.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.600]   It's got motion sensing in it.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.160]   It's also got a microphone and speaker.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.280]   So when somebody rings your doorbell, you could say, "Yeah, what is it?"
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:08.760]   Even if you're across the world, that's the beauty of this, the ring video doorbell.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.760]   I love it.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.560]   I know when people come and go to my house, when my daughter comes home late at night,
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.000]   I could say, "Hey, Abi, look at this."
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.240]   I hear you came in at 3 a.m.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.480]   I have the video.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.760]   And burglars come during the day when you're at work and there's no one to answer the door.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   They ring the doorbell.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.760]   Nobody answers.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.760]   They go around back and break in.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   Now you can answer the doorbell, even at work.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.640]   Plus get nice crystal clear video of that guy.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.400]   This time of year, you're probably getting a lot of packages.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.040]   You can see those packages.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.200]   You can see when they arrive.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.240]   You can watch them like a hawk.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.360]   Make sure nobody comes and takes them.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.600]   You get an instant alert when somebody comes by.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.920]   And the HD video of the whole thing.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:53.800]   It's like having a neighbor keep an eye on your home 24/7 without the judgment.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.040]   I love my ring doorbell.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.040]   I love it.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.480]   We're giving one to our brother-in-law because he had some packages just the other day,
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.960]   stolen off his porch.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.200]   Installing ring is easy.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   I'm no handyman.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   I was able to do it.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.720]   It will work with either existing wired doorbell or using its battery.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:17.120]   100 bucks, Time Magazine said it was the product, one of their top 10 gadgets of 2014.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.720]   I'm just a huge fan.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:24.360]   Go to ring.com/twig and you'll get free expedited FedEx shipping so you can get it just in time
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.360]   for the holidays.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.360]   Ring.com/twig.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.520]   This would be a gift.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.560]   I want to give it to everybody in my family.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.560]   Ring.com/twig.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.400]   Free FedEx shipping in the US.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.920]   With Ring, you're always home.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.760]   Thank you for their support of this week in Google.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.120]   Another story about the ring is the follow up to Shark Tank and Losing on Shark Tank.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.120]   Wasn't that great?
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.120]   It's the greatest.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.120]   It's the greatest story.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.320]   He says, "I'm glad I lost on Shark Tank."
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.920]   Well, it all worked out for him.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:42:02.720]   If he had gotten investment from Shark Tank, he would have a considerably smaller stake
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.360]   in the company.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:10.960]   By the way, he just got a $28 million investment from Richard Branson.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:16.920]   He thought his company was worth $7 million when Jamie E. Simmons went to Shark Tank a
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.920]   couple of years ago.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.920]   What was the company?
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.920]   Doorbot.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.920]   Remember that?
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.920]   Doorbot.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:28.760]   Well, and Ring is, by the way, several versions later.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:33.160]   Well now with that $28 million investment, I don't know what it's valued.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.880]   It's a little bit more.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.480]   So actually the Sharks did offer money.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:47.860]   Kevin O'Leary, Mr. Wonderful offered his $700,000 loan, took 10% of all sales until
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:53.560]   the loan was paid off, and then a 7.0% royalty in all future sales plus 5% of the equity.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:59.360]   And by the way, they don't tell you this, but the producers get a chunk too.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.760]   That's not even mentioned on the year.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   Oh, it's a...
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.760]   Oh.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.760]   You do it for publicity.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.760]   You don't do it to get funding.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.760]   That should be disclosed though.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.760]   I agree.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:09.760]   I agree.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.760]   Anyway, he's...
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.760]   It's like a big point about how the Sharks use their own money.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.720]   Yeah, they do.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.520]   But you also have to give up...
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.520]   You know, where do we find...
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:25.000]   I think Scott Jordan, when he took his Scott E. Vest to a Shark Tank, kind of revealed
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.080]   the secret of that.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:30.520]   There's Richard Branson with his Ring video, Doorbell.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.520]   I should use that in the ad, frankly.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.760]   That's a great endorsement.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:40.840]   A Ring customer was vacationing at Branson's Necker Island a couple of months ago, and
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:45.640]   used Ring to talk to a UPS delivery guy who was at his house in San Francisco.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   Branson said, "What?
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.880]   What happened there?"
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.080]   So he emailed the seminar and became an investor.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.720]   Nice story.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.880]   Just a couple of things that we'll get to Ethereum.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.480]   You can now get free Google Drive storage.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:09.480]   If you help out with Google's local guides, do some reviews, get some storage.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   You have to gain...
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.240]   This is the first world version of a mobile minutes being a currency.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.800]   You can get early access to new Google products and features.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:23.480]   You can show up in the Google Maps app with your official local guides badge.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.880]   Get a free terabyte upgrade of your drive storage, but that's going to take you two to
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.360]   499 points.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.960]   The very top level local guides will become eligible to attend our inaugural summit in
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.360]   2016, where you'll be able to meet up with other top guides from around the world, explore
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.920]   the Google campus, and get the latest info about Google Maps.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.920]   So start...
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.600]   Which years ago I went to a local New York guide meetup where they had people who were
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.600]   really into Google local.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.080]   It was kind of fun.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.080]   There were nice people.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.640]   It was cool.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.640]   Yeah, I am very grateful to the people who put reviews on Yelp.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:05.920]   So, reviews on Amazon, tips on four square, tips on local guides, I think that's great.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.280]   Local guides is more than just like a review though, right?
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:15.440]   You have to say, "Here's the secrets of San Francisco pizza," or whatever.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.440]   So it is...
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.200]   I mean, I think it's appropriate for them to give you something for it.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.360]   Because you have to put some work into it.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.360]   But...
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.080]   Well, I like there's a marketplace for this.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.480]   It's Google's frequent flyer points.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.480]   Nice.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:34.080]   So it's kind of a big contribution, I think, to the internet when you do stuff like that.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.440]   Anything you put on the internet is a contribution.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:42.280]   That's why we like the Homebrew website club and all that.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.400]   Get people up there on the web.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.800]   It's not over.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.800]   Nope.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   No.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   Let's hope not.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.720]   Hasn't even begun.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:55.440]   It's just beginning the web.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:00.960]   But international calls to France were free thanks to Google and Hangouts.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.960]   I don't know how long that's going to last, but that was of course because of the terrorist
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.960]   action.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:10.240]   The attacks in Paris on over the weekend.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.240]   Thank you, Google, for doing that.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:15.480]   Facebook did a great job as well with its safety check of helping people.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.160]   I think it was just great.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:22.800]   And I was really unhappy that everything has a naysayer.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.440]   Well for the first time they decided this thing that was designed for natural disasters,
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.680]   Facebook said, let's use safety check for a man-made disaster.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.600]   Then they got all kinds of crap that they hadn't done this decided to do this the day
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.800]   before with Beirut.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.800]   It's racist.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:42.600]   Since then, they've done it with Nairobi with with with with no with Nigeria and a bombing
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.600]   there.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.880]   But it was something that got inspired to do and they decided to do it.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:46.880]   Well, you didn't do it fast enough.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:47.880]   You didn't do it soon enough.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:48.880]   You're in a chase.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.880]   Give them a break.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.880]   The web is an outrage engine.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.880]   Isn't it really?
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.880]   Oh.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.200]   You know, what do you think?
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.200]   Do you see?
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.240]   I think there's a certain there's certain people who just always outraged.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.640]   You know, we all know them.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:06.440]   Do you think it's just that they have been given a voice and on the web so we see more
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:13.040]   of them or that the web the internet's turning normal people into outrage engines?
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.040]   It's catching.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.040]   I think it's catching.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   I think outrage is contagious.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.040]   I don't know.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   It's a good question.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   Stop it.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:26.080]   Well, I wish like optimism were contagious.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.080]   Good feeling.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.080]   I've tried that.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.680]   And there's no believe me, believe me, or there's no business model and try to make
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.680]   off.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.680]   I can tell you.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.360]   I've always been positive, but you're absolutely right.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:42.680]   The negative commentators, the the cynics, they really they they're funnier.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.520]   They're more persuasive.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.520]   They're more entertaining.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.720]   Media also likes them better and they get more attention.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.920]   Media likes because they're better on camera.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.800]   If it's the media.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:56.240]   Before I can talk me that he says you can't go wrong saying something sucks.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:04.240]   There's a Rome on live the life there.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.240]   That should be honest.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:10.120]   Not that we want John to go any time and then and and we love John.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:15.120]   But you know, but see, that's the thing you know that that's John's persona.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.040]   So you go along with it.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.040]   Right.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.520]   It's part of the mix.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:27.280]   Is that potential to be something like, you know, I told you it's I told you so.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.000]   But I have to say the web is an outrage engine.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.080]   This is to me an example of that, the Facebook thing.
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.640]   It's like, all right, you can't do you can't win for losing.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:39.480]   Well, I mean, you know, there's there's there's there is a challenge there is like, what
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.400]   threshold do they set this for?
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.400]   What do they tell them?
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:47.160]   They find it useful and they they had said that that threshold very high, which was a
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.000]   large actually is asked over a large area.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.400]   And they decided that the Paris thing was was of that scale because they were seeing
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.640]   similar requests about it.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.240]   It makes sense, though, that like you have.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.760]   It's bringing it to other things as well.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.520]   It does make sense, but you know, that you can overdo it too, right?
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.440]   You don't want this constantly going on.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440]   Well, no, exactly.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.440]   I'm safe.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.440]   I'm safe.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.440]   You know, from everything possible.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.680]   And they make the point that it doesn't work for an epidemic and it doesn't work for
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.680]   a war because there's not a definition of safe.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.680]   Right.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:16.920]   I wrote my New York observer column today about this and just said that when Katrina
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:24.160]   hit, I had recently left the company that started Nola.com, but that site became the
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.160]   place people went to.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.200]   I remember there was a story of a woman who was stuck on a roof and she texts somebody
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:33.800]   in like Utah and they go to the Nola.com forum so that the National Guard can find the
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.240]   post and then pick her up.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:41.320]   And then became a gathering point and Craigslist is a kind of gathering point and media lost
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.320]   that entirely.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.600]   The reflex is going to be I'm going to tell people I'm safe.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.600]   I'm not going to go to the newspaper.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.600]   My people aren't there.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.600]   I'm going to go to Facebook.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.600]   I'm going to go to Twitter.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:56.960]   And we, but something else that we blew in media.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.240]   Kevin Marx agrees.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.680]   Stop calling Google cardboard videos VR.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.680]   Yes.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.040]   Well, actually I'm the one who said immersive.
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.440]   You said it's immersive video.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:13.240]   We talked about it on the yes on Twitter, twig after the New York Times piece.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.520]   It's immersive video.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.520]   That's what it is.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:20.880]   And I'm trying to call it that as well.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.960]   Marcus Sullivan, the ombudsman's personally, the public had earlier.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.960]   She wrote a nice piece.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.000]   Yeah, about the ethical issues of setting up a shot.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   And I, she said it better.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.960]   I was, this is what I was trying to get at, but she said it so much better than me.
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:38.760]   But you know, when I'm watching the video, this is the New York Times piece on the children
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:44.480]   of war displaced children, there was a three or four actual children whose, you know, lives
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.720]   have been torn apart by war.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:50.560]   And it was video of them going through their daily lives.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.600]   And but I, you know, and maybe because I'm in the business, but I always think about
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.760]   what's behind the camera.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:00.720]   And in the case of immersive video, nothing because it's immersive.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.200]   So and this is what I was not expressing.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.320]   Well, but this is what I was trying to express.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.320]   When you're watching that kind of video, you have to remember it's all of it is essentially
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:15.200]   staged because in order for it to be set up, you have to set up this, say to the kid,
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:20.680]   don't move, set up this camera, say, okay, wait till I leave the frame and then you could
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.640]   do what you would normally do.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:27.520]   And you walk off and it's, I think that's a fundamental problem.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.160]   And I was saying the same problem with any media.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.720]   I mean, you, well, but no, but okay.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.040]   If we do a fly on the wood documents, you're doing the same thing.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.040]   You're saying, okay, you're going to be familiar.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.360]   Yeah, ignore us admittedly observation.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:43.840]   You know, it's a, you know, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle observation changes the
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:49.160]   observed, but Jeff's about to say that there is an ethic in television journalism of not
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.160]   staging.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.000]   Well, look at, right, you know, where they do stage, right?
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.760]   I think B roll is absurd offensive.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   It's made up.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.600]   It's fictional, the naughty shock.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:06.640]   You know, that broadcast news, one of my favorite movies of all times with, with, with
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.640]   the second camera tier.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.520]   TV's always done that whereas we've, in newspapers, we had an ethics supposedly where we would
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.520]   never set up a shot.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:17.040]   We would never tell somebody what to do.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:23.960]   I don't think that's terribly true, but when I worked for NBC with good producers, we
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:27.840]   were always told, you know, if you said, Hey, could you put your hand on that mouse and
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.840]   move it around?
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.320]   Nope, you can't do that.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.160]   That's staging.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:38.560]   So there used to be, I grant you, it's probably a long gone ethical tenant, but there was
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.440]   for a while this idea that you, when you go to shoot a news story, you can shoot what's
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.440]   going on.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:49.160]   You cannot tell somebody, okay, can you walk in that door again?
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.440]   And interviews a little different, right?
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.040]   An interview is a synthetic environment.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:57.120]   And all you're doing is you have one camera and you're trying to get the reverse so you
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.120]   can edit it.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.520]   I think that that's different.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.480]   But when you're going to cover a news story like these children and you want to show their
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:09.000]   lives, and I agree with you, Kevin, the very nature of the camera being their changes,
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:15.840]   the situation, but as best you can, what you don't want to do is say, Hey, do you think
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.320]   you can walk over there, look out the window, look sad?
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.120]   You don't ever do that.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.120]   Right.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:27.920]   But that's, you know, but that's the thing is this is much harder to edit.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.680]   You know, with classic video, you shoot it, you shoot a lot of it, shoot documentary,
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:36.440]   you shoot as much as you need, and then you edit and tell the story with the edit.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.520]   With this stuff, it's a through shot.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.880]   So if you're going to edit it, it becomes an effort like making Birdman or something.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.520]   It's like, I've got to make them walk into a dark corner and walk out again.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.320]   You can edit it.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.320]   So, you know, it is, it is, it is.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:49.920]   In a way, that makes it better, right?
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:53.120]   Because editing can retell a story, it can change a story.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:59.040]   Now, so this article is slightly off in that it says it doesn't let you do the head bubble
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.840]   to get perspective.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:01.840]   Depends how they shoot it.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:06.480]   If they shoot it with that Google 16 camera rig, you can do that because they have enough
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.480]   overlap to do that.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:12.480]   But if it's just shot with a single 360 lens, then yes, you can't do that.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.120]   And then it makes you sicker.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.320]   So there are variations on this.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.280]   But if you look at the stuff that they shot with that 16 camera thing.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   I haven't.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   I would love to see it.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:27.200]   But that stuff, you get a better sense of space because because they've got cameras that are
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:31.480]   close enough to being where your eyes are, you can, you can, something there can actually
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:36.000]   have parallax as you move your head.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.960]   But that means you can do a kind of, you know, there's two ways you sense depth.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.840]   You know, other sense depth by, you know, convergence of the eyes, or you actually do
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.080]   it by moving your eyes and seeing what moves.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.800]   So if you actually think about how people do it, they do a little secade where they move
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:58.720]   their head and that lets you know, oh, the microphone is here and the umbrella is over
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:03.440]   there and the orange is over there because it didn't move as much.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.960]   And that's a natural thing you do.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:09.080]   And if you've got a single viewpoint camera, you can't replicate that.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:15.160]   Whereas if you have that, the 16 camera rig, those are spaced far enough apart that you
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:20.680]   can get and they can interpolate it so you can get actual things moving as you move your
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.280]   head in planes.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.280]   So you get a little piece.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:28.720]   I mean, obviously you can't move far, but you can rotate a little bit.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.680]   And that does make a difference.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:35.680]   But yeah, there's the full thing of, we're actually simulating the environment and remapping
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:40.800]   it so you can move your head anywhere and move forward backwards through the space is
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.720]   a different model.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:49.200]   The, by the way, Margaret Sullivan is one of the best columnists in the New York Times.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.200]   She's the public editor.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:57.760]   Her role is as ombudsman to represent the public interest and speak truth to power her
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.480]   employers.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:06.880]   She quotes the former managing editor of the Washington Post, Robert Kaiser who complained
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:12.480]   that the time seems to be touting a process that will often be based on tricks and deceptions
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.760]   by the photographers and cameraman.
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:21.200]   The editors, a letter from Mr. Silverstein, which is the Jack Silverstein, the editor
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:26.160]   at Times magazine who oversaw it, described how the virtual reality filmmaker works to
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:31.040]   ensure that the quote, the action unfolds the way he imagined.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:34.960]   Mr. Silverstein wrote that quote, VR tote usually involves more coordination between
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.600]   filmmaker and subject.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:42.200]   And in traditional video journalism, a subject may be asked to repeat in action or wait until
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.680]   the filmmakers out of sight to complete a task.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:49.520]   This Mr. Kaiser said is tantamount to faking a scene and that's not sound journalism.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.520]   I kind of agree.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.760]   It's more filmmaking than it is journalism.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.400]   Well, I mean, it actually, if you're doing the stuff, it's actually more like staging
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.400]   a play.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.400]   Right.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.400]   It's very reason you can't edit.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:04.840]   So you, you, you have to set it up like a, like a, like a theater performance and also
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:09.440]   in the same way that you, when you're staging a play in a, in a, like a non conventional
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:14.080]   theater, you have to encourage people to look in the right direction to see the action.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.560]   So if you've got people running past things going on, if you're looking, if you're looking
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:20.240]   the wrong way, if you're looking out the window, then you, then you, then you can miss it with
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.240]   these things.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.440]   So you actually have to cue it with audio and things as well.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:30.280]   So to do this stuff successfully is, is much more like staging a play than it is like editing
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.280]   video.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.280]   And it's going to require different productions.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:37.000]   It's appropriate for us to bring this up because what we, what you, what everybody wants
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.120]   is an informed readership that understands what they're seeing and understands what might
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.280]   or might not be involved in the making of that.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:49.120]   And so understand when you're looking at immersive video, that is really much more of
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:55.040]   a creation than the, but the, but the point is, you know, when, when I was young, learning
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:59.680]   video production was a dark, dark art that you had to do with the specific that nobody
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:04.160]   had, whereas now everyone has like three cameras in their pocket and understands about framing
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.960]   shots carefully for hope so.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:11.400]   I also think you're on editing the vine to six seconds to make it work.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:18.280]   You know, there's the fact that all of us can do this individually and anyone growing
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:22.080]   up with these tools gets that media editorial education built in.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:26.200]   I think, you know, there's a certain sort of excessive hand rigging here about people
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:29.160]   can edit things and re cut things to sell stories.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.880]   It's like, yes, we know that.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:35.960]   There's a reason that my headshot looks good on Facebook is because I took 45 of them to
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:42.600]   get the one that was, but I think I think the times should do a behind the scenes, how
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.520]   it's made because that is part of the education.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:48.480]   I was the first time I went on the show on the media is we're walking down the hall.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:52.920]   The young intern producers said, I should let you know we edit a lot.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.960]   Why can you tell me that?
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.840]   And they, and in fact, when Barbara Garfield does it, he'll start over a question five
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.720]   to 10 times sometimes.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:06.800]   And in the end, the miracle is they make it sound like it's one question and they other
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:13.680]   miracle is they'll take up my, you know, and make me sound kind of line with it.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.680]   I kind of.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.240]   Well, yeah, but, but they did.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:19.680]   So one of the great piece where they actually explained this process.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:20.680]   Exactly.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.680]   That's what I was going to say in that web.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.680]   Yes.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:26.920]   And it was, it was really good because it is in fact the person who produced it since
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.520]   died and it was one of his favorite things.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:34.160]   I remember, but it was great because it gave you that sense of the transperos behind it.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.720]   If anyone should be transparent about that.
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:40.440]   So in a sense, what I want to see from the times is a view of the journal standing there
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:45.400]   with the ring and know where that person is or I want to see a separate video saying,
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:49.720]   showing how she runs out of the frame and how that works.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:54.640]   So we have a sense of what we are watching and know that context.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:57.320]   We have a kind of, I've always had a kind of ethos.
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:03.440]   And this came back from doing a tech TV up to then all the technology television.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.440]   Well, in that time it was computer television that had been done.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.000]   They would edit out things like crashes.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.040]   They would edit out the time it took to install a program.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:18.680]   And it, what happened is they communicated, miscommunicated the experience of computing.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:22.120]   And, and it has a couple of, you know, negative effects.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:26.560]   One is it oversells it, but also it makes people feel bad when there's crashes and takes
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.400]   forever and installs like, what am I doing wrong?
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.800]   Those guys seem so fluent.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:34.360]   So when we did the screensavers and call for help, I said, we will always do this live.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.360]   And it, you know, we will not.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.280]   I thought about that way, but that's really important.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.280]   You're right.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.280]   That's part of your credibility.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.600]   And stuff would crash and stuff wouldn't work.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.960]   And that's, we didn't hide that.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.000]   And so when we started doing Twit, we kind of had the same idea.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.200]   You know, the shows are edited, but they're never edited for content.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.300]   They're always edited.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:57.020]   If somebody swears, we put a boop in and we never rearranged stuff.
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.180]   We try to edit it as little as as possible.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.820]   The most major edit is when we have absolute hell with communication.
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.820]   Sometimes we'll cut it out.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.820]   Okay.
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:06.820]   Let's stop it.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:07.820]   We'll start again.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:08.820]   Mostly because I don't want to waste people's time, but I don't want to misrepresent people.
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:11.860]   And I don't want to cut out us because if somebody's stupid, I don't want them to sound
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:12.860]   smart.
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:16.060]   I want you to hear them as they are.
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.380]   Anyway, I am.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:24.060]   I just, I maybe have a different kind of point of view.
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.420]   I think I want to show things as they are.
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.420]   Yes.
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.940]   But I don't know.
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:36.620]   By the way, thank you, Kevin, for the link to this on the media show from Friday, May
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.340]   25th, 2007, pulling back the curtain.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.820]   If you want to listen to it.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.620]   Oh, just this, no, that's wonderful.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.420]   A lot of public radio does this.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.860]   I think people don't understand that Terry Gross does this.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.780]   And a lot of public radio is heavily edited.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.780]   Well, the latest episode of startup, was it startup?
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:54.940]   I think, um, um, talked about this.
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:58.020]   So, you know, the, um, what are they called?
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:59.020]   Gimmelet Media.
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.020]   It does the, does the bunch of podcasts.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:05.860]   They, they, so startup is the one where they talk about themselves as a show.
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.860]   And they, they basically said, but okay.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.860]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:14.860]   Well, early podcasting always was, but anyway, go ahead.
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:15.860]   Right.
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.900]   But the, but the point was that, yeah, so it's, it's called the secret formula.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:20.900]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:25.140]   Um, and what they say is, it's a, what's our secret formula for success and what, how do
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.140]   we get these problems to do well?
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.180]   And I said, the answer is that we edit them a lot and work really hard to make them sound
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.180]   good.
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.180]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:35.540]   And they talk a bit about the, um, the process they go through editing these and it is very
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:42.540]   much that very high, high touch, high production, lots of planning thing that comes from documentary
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.060]   radio from, from that.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:49.820]   And I understand that that's, and that's very much the public broadcasting model always has
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:50.820]   been.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:54.620]   And, uh, and I just come from a different, uh, side of the fence.
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:55.780]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.620]   I enjoy listening to public broadcasting.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:02.340]   Although when I found out that clicking clack worked so very differently from the way I
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.260]   do call on radio, you know, I do call on radio.
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:08.380]   It's live and the calls come in and you answer them in the next one calls and clicking
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.940]   clack would solicit calls.
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:14.820]   They'd call the 800 number, they'd call you back if they liked your sound, record you
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.220]   with clicking clack.
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:22.620]   Uh, they would record four or five hours and edit the best down to an hour worth, which,
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:26.740]   and so the problem is it's hard for me to compete with that.
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:31.140]   I'm never going to be as funny and as tight and as wonderful as public radio because I
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.380]   am doing more.
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.540]   It's an all production, but it's my personal ethos.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.140]   That's the way I like to do it.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:38.140]   I prefer to do it.
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.140]   Sure.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:40.140]   You make it up in volume.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.140]   I mean, that's the thing.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:42.140]   Yeah, I make it up in volume.
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.140]   Exactly.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:48.100]   If you were doing it with this thing, then we do the same to our conversation we have
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.580]   and cut it down to a half hour show.
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:50.580]   It'd be a half hour show.
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:51.580]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.620]   And you could do that and that would probably work.
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:55.460]   It would be a different kind of show.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.300]   Well, it would not be as timely.
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.300]   That's for sure.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.020]   That was the other reason that we don't edit is we want it to be timely.
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.500]   We want to get it out the door as quickly as possible.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.540]   Well, you also just get rid of the, it's the conventions driving nuts and I've, I've
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:08.060]   railed a lot about this for the show, but the I'm standing in front of the fire where
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.060]   nothing's happening.
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.060]   Yeah, a lot of that.
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:13.060]   A B roll, not these handles.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:16.540]   You know what drives me nuts these days?
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:17.540]   What drives me?
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:21.780]   Absolutely nuts is after you finish a story on, let's say ABC Nightly News, whatever they
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:24.580]   call it and we come back and they finished it.
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:25.580]   They finished the story.
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.580]   It's done.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.780]   And then the anchor has to say, well, yes, that's a terrible situation.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:32.780]   Boy, we were going to think a lot about that tonight.
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.780]   So this is meaningless.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.780]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:36.780]   Yes.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:41.500]   And these are all of the orthodoxies of old media.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:44.740]   My favorite is only time will tell.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.740]   Yes.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:46.740]   Yes.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.740]   That's a very difficult story.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:49.740]   Yes, it is.
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.540]   I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, I had it a lot to my understanding for you to tell me that.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:57.300]   A lot of what's interesting is people have internalized that from watching so much television.
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:01.660]   And I see people doing that completely unnecessarily all the time that, that there's this kind
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:05.740]   of, it's something actually we have to deal with with new hosts a lot is they do a lot
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:09.620]   of tropes that are mainstream media tropes.
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:12.220]   You don't, you can stop doing that now.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.220]   We don't care.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:18.420]   Well, another interesting thing, you know, later today I'm going to come back at 11 in
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.220]   the night and do a thing with Good Morning America.
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.660]   They're celebrating their 40th anniversary.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:27.620]   And one of our good friends and hosts, Becky Worley, is their technology report.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:29.620]   You're doing this very neat thing.
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.180]   They asked her to put together an hour or two and, and instead of going to the computer
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:37.940]   history museum, which they wanted to do, to do and actually made her do yesterday, she
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.300]   said, can we do it from Twitter?
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.940]   And they said, they took them up some convincing, I understand, but they agreed to do it.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:47.900]   Of course, remember, it's 11 a 11 p.m. Pacific, 2 a.m. Eastern.
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:51.740]   It's not exactly prime time.
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:52.740]   But never though.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.620]   And you know, I, we do our thing the way we do our thing.
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:01.820]   It's, I think it's fascinating to see my team interact with network televisions.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:05.700]   Talk about an impedance mismatch.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:10.540]   No, you guys are doing great.
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:11.740]   I'm not knocking yet.
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:15.780]   Just saying that they have a different way of thinking the things I'm used to it.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:19.460]   I've worked in the American mainstream media for years.
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:20.460]   So I understand.
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:22.900]   In fact, one of the reasons Twitter exists is because I hate it so much.
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.380]   I'm so allergic to it that we decided to do it differently.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.380]   Guys don't change.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.380]   Don't change.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.380]   I like what we do.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.380]   Is it 10 p.m.?
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:34.100]   Oh, well, it's only 1 a.m. Eastern.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.020]   And oh, that's another thing mainstream media.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.460]   The only time is New York time.
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.860]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:39.860]   Nothing else matters.
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:40.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.860]   I watched the voice.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.420]   We were hosting our sign.
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:46.060]   They're like, and you can save this artist.
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:47.060]   No, you can't.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.060]   No, you can't.
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.060]   We haven't.
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.060]   We can't.
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:51.060]   So, OK.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.100]   So if you can save this artist.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.100]   Confession.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:59.900]   We got the, the tweet at 523 Pacific Time saying, do you want to save this artist?
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:02.020]   The show's not on for three hours.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.020]   And then you watch the show.
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.020]   It says, too late.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.020]   Voting's over.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.260]   Guess nobody counts on the West Coast.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.980]   In fact, nobody outside the Eastern Time Zone counts.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:13.300]   Now, we know, Kevin, I wouldn't have thought of you as a voice fan.
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:14.300]   The voice is good.
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.300]   Who do you like?
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.220]   Tell me, tell me you don't watch Dancing With The Stars.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.220]   Please, tell me that.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:20.220]   The voice is good.
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:22.860]   The voice is actually, is actually well structured.
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:23.860]   Yes.
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:24.860]   And I want to say that.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:25.860]   It's very, I watch it for that.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:26.860]   I watch it.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:30.340]   I watch it to look through the lens at the producing.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.340]   Oh, God.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.980]   They, they, they needed some work on their editing.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:38.540]   They have this hideous habit in basically what they need someone to take their shows
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:43.300]   and chop out the repetition so that you get them down to like the, the early stage runs
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.780]   for the chair turns.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.260]   They're, they're OK because they, those are actually edited.
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:52.340]   But then the next stage where they're like, and now we're going to have these people
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:54.140]   dueling and it was something funny.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.140]   Somebody said.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.900]   I think that funny thing somebody says four times in the trails.
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:00.900]   Then eventually they say it and you're like, yes, I heard that three times.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.900]   It has no impact on them.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:03.300]   Kevin, you know why they're doing that.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:07.300]   They have many ads to sell and little content to show.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.300]   Well, it's a good cause.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.300]   But it's just like.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.300]   In fact, we skip.
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.300]   Okay.
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.300]   Now I'm talking about ad blocker.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.300]   We skipped to the singing.
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.020]   So you can watch a two hour.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:18.020]   The voice.
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.020]   We did.
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.020]   It's about five minutes.
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.020]   Well, no, we.
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.020]   You won't summon the biplane the conversation.
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.020]   A little bit.
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:27.420]   But you you you you you you learn to watch when they're about to start the package and
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:28.740]   you skip over the package.
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:29.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:33.340]   And they got a ramp up package and I'd break around down package.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:37.940]   If you just chop that out, then yeah, you can watch this show.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:40.260]   Half the time.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:44.580]   We watched the whole thing in half an hour this morning.
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.580]   But in our defense, we're in the gym.
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.180]   We're working out while we're watching it.
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.340]   So it's not that's maybe I should do that.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.340]   There you go.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.340]   That's a good rule.
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:55.940]   Tonight, 10 p.m. Pacific.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:57.740]   One a.m. Eastern.
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.140]   Although tune in early.
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:04.660]   A will be here and be we've already been informed that we might end early.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:06.500]   So you'd be ready to go early.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.060]   So it's on ABC.
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:11.540]   No, no, where's it streaming?
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.900]   It's on ABC.go.com.
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.500]   Will they then?
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.580]   No.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:19.420]   Only love?
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.500]   It's only live streaming.
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:24.940]   So the idea was they wanted to do 40 hours to celebrate 40 years of GMA.
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:27.140]   But they can't do 40 hours of ABC network time.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.140]   It's too valuable.
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:29.260]   So they stream it.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:32.260]   And some of it I think they probably show.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.260]   But most of it's just streamed.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:35.260]   Can you get them to do this before?
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:38.220]   And by the way, do you feel for ABC that they didn't get ABC.com?
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.220]   They got go.com.
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.700]   Well, that was that whole early Disney thing.
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:42.700]   They were all proud.
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:47.700]   They had I went to meetings with some way back in the day in my corporate executive mode.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.980]   But they were so proud that the whole web was going to be go.
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:53.180]   This is going to be the most valuable thing they're watching.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.180]   So stupid.
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.620]   It's everybody had their Yahoo moment.
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.740]   Speaking of Yahoo.
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:02.340]   Do we talk about them hiring McKinsey?
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.340]   Let's talk.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:08.220]   But hold on because we got to do it after this word from Linda.com.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.900]   I know you guys like to learn.
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:12.580]   I like to learn.
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:14.220]   I like to learn.
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:16.900]   To me, that's my hobby is learning how to do stuff.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:17.900]   Like coding.
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.060]   I always like to learn different programming languages.
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.500]   I never write anything.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:26.860]   But I like to learn them photography, right?
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:30.620]   And then you learn how to use Adobe Photoshop and all that stuff.
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:34.340]   If you like to learn or maybe you have to learn for your office, maybe maybe the boss
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:38.260]   just said, Smith, you know how to do Excel pivot tables, right?
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.900]   Have that for me in the morning.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:42.180]   You need Linda.com Linda.

[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:01.140]   your Photoshop skills or all three.
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:04.740]   By the way, you don't have to decide ahead of time when you subscribe to Linda.com.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.300]   You get the run of the place.
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:10.140]   You can watch any video, any course, any time.
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:14.460]   They just put up courses, Android essential training, switching from an iPhone to an Android.
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.540]   You need this.
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:18.980]   An introduction to data analysis with Python.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.180]   Here's what I'm sure to take.
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:21.180]   I can't wait.
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.340]   Up and running with Go.
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:27.900]   That's course Google's systems programming language.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:32.300]   By the way, Kernigan is part of the, I just got his new Go book.
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:35.740]   There's even a new course on producing professional podcasts.
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:41.620]   You can learn anything you want to know at Linda.com, LYNDA.com.
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:44.140]   That's the old Android essential training by the way you were showing.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:45.980]   I don't want anybody to think this from 2014.
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.540]   There's a new one that just went up.
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:48.620]   They update these all the time.
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:50.620]   There's up and running with Go.
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.980]   Those are great language for concurrency.
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:55.980]   If you want to learn Swift, they got that too.
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:59.180]   What's nice is you can take the course beginning to end, but the courses are divided up into
[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:01.460]   a little chunk so you can watch a little bit of the time.
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:05.740]   You can even search the written transcripts for each course and find the part you want
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:08.780]   and watch just that part.
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:10.460]   It's fantastic.
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:13.060]   You can even download the tutorials and watch them on the Go.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.900]   Access on your Android or iOS device.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:17.500]   Linda.com, here's what we're going to do.

[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.700]   Just kind of like being a subscriber for the next 10 days at Linda LYNDA.com/twig.
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.140]   Oh, Go command line tools.
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.140]   That's fun.
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:32.420]   They'll be much better than bash, right?
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:37.460]   LYNDA.com/twig.
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:40.980]   Linda.com.
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:43.420]   It's fantastic.
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:44.420]   There it is.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:45.420]   40 for 40.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:46.420]   Watch the live stream now.
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:50.060]   I wonder what they're doing right now.
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:51.780]   They brought back the old hosts and everything.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:58.100]   I mean, it's kind of cool, but the stuff we're doing is in the middle of the night, so they
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.100]   don't really care.
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.100]   This could be fun.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.420]   Becky Worley will be here and we're going to do wearables, do some fun stuff.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.300]   I'm excited about it.
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.980]   Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York, CUNY, where he teaches journalism.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:14.980]   Kevin Marks, Man About Town.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:16.980]   Tell us about the indie webcam.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:22.220]   Well, there's actually two events I wanted to talk about.
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:29.980]   There's Homebrew website club, which is tonight in San Francisco, Portland, and Yotaburg, though
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:34.780]   I think that one's actually happened, and Brighton, which I think has also happened.
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:35.780]   Because of the time difference.
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:37.660]   Because they're in there in there.
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:40.380]   The Yotaburg was at the steam punk bar.
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:41.380]   Yes.
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:42.860]   That sounds like fun.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:43.860]   There's actually two.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.660]   There's a guy in Malmo as well in Sweden.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.660]   So we've got two two.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:47.660]   Nice.
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:48.660]   Sweet.
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:49.660]   Yeah, two.
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:52.180]   So yeah, so tonight in San Francisco, it's the second time.
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:54.220]   Second anniversary of Homebrew website club.
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:59.940]   And the idea of this is if you want to have your own website, or if you've got your own
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:03.620]   website and you want to improve it and work on it, this is a group where we get together
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.540]   and do that, talk about it, and show things off and so on.
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:09.540]   And there'll probably be a decent sized group there tonight because it's the second anniversary.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:13.580]   I'm not sure everyone's actually a RSVP on the wiki.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:19.820]   So Ben from NONE will be there and me and Tantek and some others.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:24.540]   But the point is it's like a cell building your own web stuff.
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:25.540]   That's the Homebrew website club.
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:30.780]   It normally takes a couple of hours in the evening and it starts fairly early.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:35.060]   So you can, if you're in San Francisco or Portland, you can get there after work and
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:37.060]   then go home.
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:40.620]   Indie web camp is a bigger thing.
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:41.780]   It's either one or two days.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:45.740]   I think the next one is in San Francisco in the beginning of December.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.460]   Let me look at the actual date.
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:52.860]   December 3rd from 10 to 1800.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:57.260]   Yes, and that will be at Mozilla in San Francisco.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:00.260]   And the pattern there is more...
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.660]   It's a hack day.
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:06.460]   The normal end of web pattern is a two day thing with an unconference day and a hack day.
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:11.220]   And this one we're basically doing a hack day because a bunch of us are in town for the
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:13.740]   social web working group meeting.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:17.660]   So we're going to spend some time arguing about San and then spend a day actually building
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:19.660]   things on our sites and putting stuff together.
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.580]   So people invited to that too.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.580]   Really cool.
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.780]   I should really come down to these.
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:26.780]   You should.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:27.780]   Yeah, I'd love to.
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:31.780]   I think it would be tricky for you to come down for the...
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.780]   It's too early for...
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.780]   Nobody would really fish off the show, don't you?
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:36.780]   So you could maybe do that.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.900]   I might be able to run out the door.
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:45.660]   But yeah, if you want to drop by for the other ones, we normally do it the weekend.
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:51.060]   This time it's midweek because it was time to come on the other event.
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:54.460]   But we can help you identify your website even further.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.460]   You've got...
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.460]   I haven't known...
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.460]   There's no site that does all the new web stuff.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:01.860]   I'm sure we could make your main site more Induweb friendly.
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:02.860]   That would be good.
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:05.140]   With a little bit of editing.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:10.100]   What could possibly be wrong with that?
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:13.100]   And there's a Google+ post all about this as well.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.460]   Oh, we're ecumenical.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:16.460]   Also, yeah.
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:17.460]   So part of the...
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:20.540]   And there's a Facebook event and so on.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:24.740]   So part of the point of the Induweb is not to say we are going to replace Facebook with
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.740]   our own websites.
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.220]   We want to make it possible to do that.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.740]   But clearly we're not going to get everyone on Earth to switch from Facebook to their
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.100]   own website.
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:37.180]   So we want to make sure that the protocols we define, we can have versions that bridge
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:40.700]   back and forth from the social side as people already use.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:46.780]   So there's a site called Bridget that does that that translates between Induweb protocols
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.460]   and whatever Propriotia API the site uses.
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:54.780]   So as a developer, you can just use the Induweb stuff and there's the work for translating
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:59.940]   Facebook or Twitter to that is done once that you can use.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:04.860]   And the other thing is thinking about...
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.300]   Is learning from the user experience that these sites build and say, "Oh, they've done
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.660]   something there that's interesting.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.420]   There's something in Google+ that's quite nice.
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:13.180]   Something Facebook that's quite nice.
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:14.180]   Something Twitter that's good.
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.540]   Can we learn from those and work on those in a new way?"
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:24.580]   So the big fuss a couple of weeks ago was Twitter changing the start to a heart and
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:25.580]   the likes.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.580]   I'm sure you talked about that on the show.
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.060]   And it was a lot of...
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:33.820]   The heart didn't last very long to it.
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:39.620]   Well, the thing that struck me about that was that they missed a trick in the...
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:43.460]   That if you actually look at how people use Twitter, which is the classic way to use
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:47.140]   Twitter features, people react to things by using emoji.
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:52.060]   And we have a vocabulary that is fairly important compared to whole star because it's
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.380]   it.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:54.860]   And so if you just...
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:18:01.340]   If there's a thing called emoji tracker.com, which if you go to that, it will show you all
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:03.780]   the emoji being used on Twitter in real time.
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:06.540]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:10.580]   And the one that the most popular one is the one that they just added to the OED.
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.580]   Oh, you've got to...
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:13.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:17.500]   They actually do it so fast that they have to warn you if you're an epileptic that might
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.500]   be flashing at you.
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.660]   So if you're an epileptic, please don't watch this.
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:22.660]   Holy.
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:23.660]   So this is in real time.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:25.140]   This is in real time the thing.
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:29.020]   So if you notice the top left corner, there's almost a billion of the...
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.020]   Well, you know why.
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:31.820]   Laughing with tears in my eyes emoji.
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:32.820]   You know why?
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:35.540]   Because the Oxford English Dictionary declared it the word of the year.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.540]   No, no, it's the same.
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:39.140]   It's been declared the word of the year, but it was the most popular one before that.
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:40.140]   Oh, really?
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:42.500]   You know, this didn't get to a billion in the last week.
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.500]   Oh, interesting.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.220]   They're not quite a billion, they're like 9, 9, 9, 9.
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.580]   So maybe the OED or whatever it is that does this...
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:48.580]   It's looking at this.
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:49.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:50.580]   ...is looking at this.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:51.580]   Face with tears of joy.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:54.220]   So you can see that they're flowing by.
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:56.580]   And if you scroll down, you get less pop through emoji.
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:57.980]   And there's a parallel as usual.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:00.060]   What's the least popular emoji?
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.020]   The customs officer.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:08.540]   Clock, face 830 is really down the list.
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.580]   But the least popular one is going through customs.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:12.740]   Little blue guy opening your suitcase.
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.580]   Little blue guy opening your suitcase.
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.780]   Oh, this one.
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:17.260]   Nobody ever uses this guy.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:21.940]   I think I used it yesterday.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:23.620]   This is not exactly flashing.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:24.620]   Yeah, this little...
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:29.100]   They've had 28,000 of these in the history of the thing compared to a billion of these.
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:30.340]   Do they have the fire hose?
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:31.340]   No, probably not.
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:32.340]   So this isn't...
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:33.340]   They do.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.340]   They seem to have the fire hose, yeah.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:36.340]   Yeah.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:37.340]   Huh.
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.340]   So...
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.860]   But this is the fascinating thing for me.
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:43.140]   If you actually look at this and you look at any of these, if you look at the hearts and
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:48.860]   the stars and the exploding at heart size and whatever, all the other emoji reactions,
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:51.020]   people are using these continuously.
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:56.700]   So my suggestion is if you miss the star on Twitter, what you should do is instead of
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:02.260]   hitting the heart button, you hit retweet and it says add a comment and just add a comment
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:04.260]   that's an emoji star.
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:09.740]   That gives you the ability to send a star, but it also means you can send them a newspaper
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.820]   or a turd or whatever.
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.300]   Right.
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:14.380]   But it doesn't have the same...
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:16.580]   It doesn't save them as something that's been created.
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:18.540]   It doesn't have that added functionality, yeah.
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.540]   Well, it actually looks like it's a...
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:23.060]   You could do a search, right?
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:25.660]   Twitter search is not good at finding emoji.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:26.660]   That is the slight drawback.
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:30.540]   What you're heading toward Kevin is emoji tags.
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:32.300]   Yes, no exactly.
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:33.300]   I mean, you know the way...
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:36.740]   I wrote an essay on this, just put it in the thing.
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:39.020]   I will put it in the thing.
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:41.300]   But the...
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:42.300]   Do you slack?
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:43.300]   I don't know if you guys use slack.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.300]   Love slack.
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:45.300]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.020]   So slack has a very clever thing with emoji reactions.
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:53.700]   So you can respond to a post in slack with an emoji and it'll put it underneath.
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.900]   And if someone's with someone who's with someone who's with someone who's with an underneath,
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:57.580]   then the other thing you can just click on those to vote.
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:00.580]   So you can respond with two different emotions, you just say...
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:01.940]   Slack is amazing.
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:02.940]   Star or heartless.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:09.740]   So the thing they've done there is they've actually compressed the like, star, heart,
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:13.740]   dichotomy, expanded that into it, could be any emoji.
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:17.980]   But also, with a voting mechanism that's better than Twitter's voting mechanism as well.
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:18.980]   That's awesome.
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:19.980]   So there's a...
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:22.340]   The pattern there is very smart.
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:27.140]   But Stewart needs to take slack and take over Twitter to become the next Twitter.
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.940]   I'm doing a report.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:30.500]   So there was a post this week.
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:35.700]   Somebody was in some percent test at Twitter where the heart was replaced with a pop-up
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.220]   of Trevor choice of emoji.
[01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:38.620]   So they're clearly testing this somewhere.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:40.420]   And it makes perfect sense.
[01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:41.980]   But the...
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.700]   What I hope is that they do it that takes advantage of this existing flood of emoji that
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:49.380]   people are using in the classic way that they did with hashtags and ads.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:53.380]   So you're learning from what the users do rather than adding a thing on top that isn't
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:56.700]   really part of it, the way they did with polls, where the polls don't even show up in the
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.020]   plain text.
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:03.900]   So if you're using anything else that parses Twitter apart from the clients that have been
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:07.900]   updated, because not all of them have been updated, the official ones, you don't see the
[01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:08.900]   polls.
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:13.100]   You just see the question, you don't see the possible answers, which is a design failure
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.100]   in their part.
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.020]   I have a new idea for a show.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:23.420]   I think we should sit and watch until this goes to a billion.
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:26.900]   It's going to take a while.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:29.500]   It's as close as it looks.
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:37.180]   997,302,124 crying face emojis.
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.300]   You have the time it will work out.
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:41.300]   You can probably extrapolate when it's going to happen.
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:42.860]   But yes, there's three million more to go.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:44.900]   Although it's going up fast.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.900]   But you're right.
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.900]   It's going to be a piece away.
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:48.900]   Yes.
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.420]   For a better problem than that, yeah.
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:55.380]   Why is this card with a heart more popular than the heart?
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:57.820]   So it depends.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:00.060]   They look the same on iOS, I think.
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:02.660]   Ah, it's those damn iOS users.
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:05.500]   There were two different hearts.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:08.780]   One was supposed to be the suit and one was supposed to be the heart.
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:10.780]   But they looked the same on iOS.
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:13.900]   And there are some, yeah, if you actually add up the various hearts, there are lots
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.980]   more hearts than the rest of the hearts do at ranked stars.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:19.580]   So you can say Twitter maybe was doing data on this.
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:23.660]   But then these different hearts and stars and faces do have different nuances.
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:33.260]   Ah, there are my favorite completely intelligible emoji person raising both hands in celebration.
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:34.260]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:36.860]   115,831,423 uses.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:40.020]   Well, the one, two up from that, the thumbs up.
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:41.020]   The thumbs up.
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.500]   No, they're one above that.
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:46.540]   By the way, that's culturally the thumbs up could mean a variety of different things.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:47.540]   The hands together.
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:48.540]   Yeah, the crane.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:53.460]   The iOS one looks like high five, whereas actually it means it's supposed to be praying
[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:54.460]   all the namaste.
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:55.460]   Right.
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:58.420]   So and depending on, you know, we get into emoji Daleks here.
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:02.540]   So depending on what your emoji set looks like, these things can look very different.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:03.540]   Right.
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:04.740]   Which can be confusing.
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:05.740]   Yeah.
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:11.980]   But the semiotics of emojis next on Twitch.
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.980]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:20.660]   It is a fascinating thing that basically it's in the same way that we added hashtags and
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:22.380]   apps to Twitter to mean things.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.060]   Because that was what we had.
[01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:29.460]   We now have this vocabulary of things that are being added to it and being used for all
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:33.060]   kinds of stuff and making sense of that was interesting.
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:37.580]   The Instagram guys did a bunch of data stuff on this to try to work out.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:42.060]   What they basically did was correlate the emoji with words that people use to try and come
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:47.220]   up with a, as if they co-occur a lot, then they assume it's a similar meaning and they
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:49.260]   did a bunch of posts on this.
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:53.460]   So all they have is like, right?
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:55.860]   All Twitter have, all Twitter have is like is it.
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:59.180]   No, but all Instagram has is a heart too.
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:01.100]   No, but Instagram has comments.
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.500]   Oh, but they have comments.
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:04.500]   Right.
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:07.020]   I see the same.
[01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:08.700]   So they did analytics on the comments.
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:10.380]   The comments are actually subsidiary to the post.
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:14.100]   So in Twitter, the reply is sort of a first order object.
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:17.780]   When I reply to a post, I'm making a post too and it can stand alone.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.860]   Whereas Instagram, they're definitely subordinate.
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:23.140]   So the comments are comments on the photograph or video.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:29.020]   I decided to order a Blackberry Priv today so that I could type emojis faster.
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.020]   It has.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:31.020]   Oh.
[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.020]   Well, there's a...
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:37.100]   I'm not sure the Priv makes you type faster Leo.
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.740]   I'll just go ahead and refer you to last night's all about Android.
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:41.260]   Did you guys have a Priv there?
[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:42.780]   We had a typing contest.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:44.220]   So we had two Prives.
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:45.220]   You did?
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.620]   And then I had Google keyboard on my 6P.
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:48.620]   How did I miss this?
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:49.620]   This was with Jason.
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:50.620]   And Ron had us a Swift key.
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:56.460]   And we did a typing contest to Twitter and neither Priv entered the finals.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.460]   No kidding.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.460]   Yeah.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:25:59.460]   That's a Swift, well, Swift.
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:00.460]   It's quite a nice place.
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:03.860]   Priv is getting a lot of positive reviews all of a sudden.
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:05.420]   There's a secret option in Swift key.
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.860]   There's a hidden option in Swift key that you can make it suggest emoji when you type
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.860]   words.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:10.860]   Right.
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:12.860]   So if you type train, it'll show you the train emoji.
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:13.860]   So turn that on.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:14.860]   That makes them quicker.
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:15.860]   Well, I made a mistake.
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:16.860]   I ordered a Priv.
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:17.860]   I probably should have watched all about Android.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:19.700]   I left just as you were starting.
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.620]   We need a Priv in the house.
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:22.620]   I...
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:25.060]   You know the cameras F12?
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:26.060]   F1.2?
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:27.860]   It's a really fast camera.
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:31.100]   With a Schneider Kreitzer lens.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:37.900]   So I just stuck the Instagram emoji meaning post in the chat as well.
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:40.340]   There's an Instagram emoji for posts.
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:44.780]   So basically what they did was they did a bunch of data science where they looked at
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:45.780]   the...
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:46.780]   If you scroll down a bit.
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:47.780]   Yes.
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:50.900]   They looked at the emoji and saw what words and hashtags came with them.
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.260]   And so what they found is that some of them are really obvious.
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:59.620]   So yeah, crying laughing was the most popular one there as well.
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:04.020]   And that clearly maps to various incoherent web expressions for laughing.
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:06.340]   That's Edvard Monks the Scream.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:08.740]   Why are they calling that anything but the Scream?
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:12.980]   Well, the official name of it is something else.
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:14.700]   But isn't it the Scream?
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:15.700]   Yes.
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:17.420]   So if you scroll down a little bit from that.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.420]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.420]   Okay.
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:20.420]   Okay.
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:27.780]   There's a little word I love.
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:30.340]   So this is really interesting.
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:31.340]   There's quite a bit of...
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:34.220]   Deep machine that they start doing translations.
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:38.300]   And so they say basically these what are these emoji correlated with?
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:39.300]   Ah.
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.260]   Crying laughing is correlated with...
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:42.260]   Hello, hello, yeah.
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:43.260]   Or a website.
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:44.700]   Incaherent expressions of laughter.
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:45.700]   Right.
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:51.500]   Whereas eyes with hearts is clearly lechery.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.700]   Misspelled beautiful and gorgeous and so on.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.300]   Yeah, what is the deal with that?
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:57.020]   Perf, huts, bay.
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:58.020]   Wow.
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:59.020]   Yes.
[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:00.020]   So this is the talk.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.020]   It's actually a bit emoji to English.
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:07.700]   And actually translating it emoji into sort of strange post English internet nonsense.
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:08.700]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:13.540]   So heart is XOXO with very numbers of X's nose.
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:14.540]   Right.
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:15.540]   And moi.
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:16.540]   And boobair.
[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:18.060]   I love you and babe and moi.
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:19.060]   Moi.
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.060]   Moi.
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:25.340]   So in a sense they are, you know, it's non-verbic expressions of emotion.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:29.660]   And if they actually collating with these things in that, that makes sense.
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:30.660]   Right.
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.900]   So you both know Jonathan Harris's "We Feel Fine."
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:35.900]   No.
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:36.900]   Yes.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:37.900]   I don't.
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:38.900]   What is it?
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:39.900]   Brilliant.
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:40.900]   It's a little old number.
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:41.900]   It was back before all this in the days of blogs.
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:44.940]   Jonathan went and used the word "feel" and "feeling."
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:45.940]   I'm feeling this.
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:47.420]   I'm feeling that.
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:48.420]   And did a brilliant talk.
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:49.420]   Oh, I remember that.
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:50.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:52.420]   Graphic.
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:53.420]   You could watch it in real time.
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:54.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:55.420]   Right.
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:59.020]   And then did a book of correlating to other words like this, but also age, time of year,
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.900]   time of day, and other things.
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:09.460]   Look at the regular expression for matching variants of XOXO, OMG moi, babe, babe, LOL, HHA,
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.620]   and he-he.
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:16.860]   To make sure that you get all of the versions with multiple letters, repeated letters in
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:17.860]   it.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:19.500]   That's an exercise.
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:22.700]   There's a lesson in grep right there that's just fantastic.
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:23.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:26.820]   Now this is- I love this article.
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:28.540]   This is my kind of thing.
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:30.700]   But it was for this fascinating select.
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:31.700]   We're trying to-
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.700]   Ah!
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:33.700]   But it's English and we don't actually have any English.
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:34.700]   We just have more gibberish.
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:35.700]   We're trying really hard.
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:37.700]   We're on big data science.
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:38.700]   Some people-
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:40.700]   That is a tag cloud right there.
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:43.940]   That's an emoji tag cloud.
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:47.660]   Now really, if they'd done it right, they would have made the emojis that are most popular
[01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:49.660]   bigger, right?
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:50.660]   Yes.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:52.820]   I don't know what they're trying to accomplish.
[01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:56.740]   Well, they're trying to say- they're trying to do a relaxation map of which ones co-occur.
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:57.740]   I see.
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:29:58.740]   So these all co-occur.
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:29:59.740]   Those directions together.
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:03.580]   And then you get clocks together and so on.
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.580]   Interesting.
[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:05.580]   Amazing.
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:08.420]   This is a great article.
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:13.220]   It came out last- in four years ago, October 2011, Instagram engineering blog.
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:15.220]   That's not- that's not when they write.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:16.220]   They write them more-
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:17.220]   There's more recent ones?
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:18.220]   It's like last year I think.
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:19.220]   This is-
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:21.540]   Oh no, I'm saying in October I see you're right.
[01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:23.580]   This is only six months old.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:28.380]   So this is- they're saying Apple added the emoji keyboard to iOS in October 2011.
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:32.020]   And so this is- this is- that's when this all began.
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:33.300]   In fact, you can see the jump.
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:36.420]   Here's where the- the iOS keyboard added emojis.
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:39.100]   Here's when they launched on Android.
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:42.420]   And there weren't emojis there so this is a percentage with the-
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:45.220]   And then and then Android stock emoji keyboard.
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:47.220]   And then Android keyboard.
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:54.140]   So you're- you're- you're best emoji keyboard on Android is SwiftKey.
[01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:57.020]   Why are you SwiftKey for everything?
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:01.500]   But yeah, I like it in that it will- without setting it'll suggest emoji for all my type
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.500]   words as well.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:03.500]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:04.500]   Yeah.
[01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:07.100]   Like colon cry colon.
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:10.300]   Like you're just typing a word and it says, you know, instead of using English you could
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:11.300]   use an emoji.
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.300]   Yeah.
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.300]   Oh, I love that.
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:16.300]   Because I want to be like the kids.
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:21.780]   Okay, ID, Z, Z, Z.
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:23.940]   Or they use the beta.
[01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:26.940]   Or they use the beta.
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:27.940]   Z, Z, Z, Z.
[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:31.660]   Okay, what else do you want to talk about?
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:33.780]   But I put- this is fun.
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:34.780]   Oh, Ethereum.
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:35.780]   We were going to talk about Ethereum.
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:36.780]   Oh, actually.
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:38.260]   No, I want to talk about Instagram because-
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.260]   Okay.
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:41.220]   Because I've just said nice things about now where I'll always say nice things about
[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:42.740]   them because they just announced-
[01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:43.740]   They close their API.
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:45.820]   They kill- they're killing other APIs.
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:46.820]   Yeah.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:47.820]   Which is annoying because-
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:50.380]   They're pulling a Twitter.
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:56.580]   They're basically harming the third party ecosystem that uses their read-only API.
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:57.580]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:03.700]   So, and you know, I'm kind of got a dog in this fight which was that I wrote a thing
[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:11.940]   that made a web view for Instagram in 2012 before they had one.
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:17.180]   And mine was sort of a joke where it gave you a Pinterest-flavored view of Instagram.
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:19.740]   And that says- stop working recently.
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:21.500]   I need to go and do the key.
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:25.340]   But it's exactly- if I read the list of things I don't want people doing, it's exactly this.
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:26.940]   Come June.
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:32.300]   If you are doing, for instance, an Instagram gallery, it's "buh-bye."
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:38.460]   It will allow apps, third party apps that like their own apps that add frames or titles
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:41.340]   or things like that to Instagram images and then set it back to Instagram.
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:42.340]   They'll allow those.
[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:44.540]   Well, there's someone like you post.
[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:45.940]   I mean, you've never been able to post-
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:49.020]   It's a read-only API, isn't it?
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:50.020]   Yeah.
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:51.020]   Yes.
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:52.020]   I think- yeah.
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:54.460]   Yes, it was- I don't think you can post comments.
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:55.460]   Right.
[01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:58.340]   But you could- but you could get the stream.
[01:32:58.340 --> 01:32:59.620]   Now it will only be your stream.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:00.620]   It's the app.
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:01.620]   You can only get your stream.
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:03.620]   That's the chief switch is-
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:06.260]   So, first, there's the- they're getting rid of the public-
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:11.660]   Well, the two key things are getting rid of are the stream of things that you're subscribed
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:12.660]   to.
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:13.660]   Right.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:14.660]   You can't get that anymore.
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:15.660]   Right.
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:20.980]   And you can't- you won't get the public- you can search by tag and get public feeds by tag
[01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:22.500]   and by geolocation and so on.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.980]   And they're taking those away as well.
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:27.840]   And they're doing this because there was a malicious third party app that people sign
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.940]   up for was stealing their passwords.
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:30.940]   Oh, that's their-
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:33.540]   That's their bad because they didn't use OAuth, right?
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:36.940]   I mean, they're- right.
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:40.700]   If they had used OAuth, these third party apps wouldn't have access to it.
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:42.860]   The API has OAuth, so I'm not sure what that's about.
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:45.820]   Well, they should- they should- you know the simple fix if that's what you're worried
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:52.100]   about is turning off anything, any form of authentication except OAuth, right?
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:55.380]   Oh, I guess you can't do that because-
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:56.380]   Well, you could-
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.300]   You can still scrape the website.
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:33:59.300]   Yeah.
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:04.020]   No, you can do- you can do- basically there's ways of doing this.
[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:08.980]   There are- I've got some tools that other people have written that you give it- you go-
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:11.340]   you're going to fetch your quickie from the browser and give it to the tool and it-
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:12.340]   Right.
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:16.900]   Then logs in looking like you and pull stuff out of the web stuff for you.
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:17.900]   Right.
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:18.900]   Which can be very useful.
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:22.660]   So they- stopping that would be harder.
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:27.380]   And to some extent, if you- if you take away the official API for this, that will be the
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:29.700]   only way to get my feed out of Instagram.
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:33.140]   So that's- they're going to actually encourage more people to do those kinds of hacks.
[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:35.380]   So there's a- there's a bad trade-off there, I think.
[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:39.260]   But come June of next year, you will see the apps I've been using because, for instance,
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:41.260]   there's no Instagram iPad app.
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:45.980]   So I've been using a really excellent program called Retrogram that lets me view my Instagram
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:49.500]   feed on an iPad in a very nice way.
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:50.500]   That's going to be broken.
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:51.500]   That won't work.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:59.260]   Yeah, I think I wrote one of my rents about people thinking the iPad and iPhone were completely
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:03.300]   just different things and this was a massive design flaw and used Instagram as an example.
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:05.500]   And I wrote that like three years ago.
[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:08.700]   So Zuckerberg said the iPad is not a mobile device.
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:11.940]   And it's like- Instagram still haven't fixed that.
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:15.780]   If you want to browse Instagram on the iPad, you have to use the web version.
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:16.780]   It's ridiculous.
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:23.740]   It's just, yeah, it's- it's- Ethereum.
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:24.740]   Ethereum.
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:25.740]   Explain it to us.
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:29.740]   So I can't give you a- You can't do anything right now.
[01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:30.740]   It's frozen solid.
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:31.740]   There we go.
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:32.740]   Okay.
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:35.260]   So you thought blockchain Bitcoin was confusing?
[01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:38.180]   Well, we've decided to make it more confusing.
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:43.740]   So let me see if I can, in a layman's form, describe what's going on here.
[01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:49.860]   The kind of one of the central keys of making Bitcoin work was this ability to have a decentralized
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:52.260]   authentication system, right?
[01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:54.100]   Um, yes.
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:58.020]   I mean, basically it's a public-private key system.
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.580]   So it's like PGP.
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.820]   To use Bitcoin, you have to have a public-private key pair.
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:05.500]   So if you're using a Bitcoin client, you've generated one of those.
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:10.140]   And to give people money in their Bitcoin wallet, you need their public key.
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:15.060]   To access your own Bitcoin wallet, you need your private key.
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:16.060]   That's sensible.
[01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:19.260]   Anybody's used PGP or any other form of encryption understands that.
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:24.540]   So that's- but if you use Bitcoin- so that's if you use an actual Bitcoin client, but there
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:28.580]   are proxies that let you use Bitcoin, which is where people have lost most of their money
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:30.780]   on Bitcoin because there are things that- that's complicated.
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:33.940]   If we will give you a website that lets you buy a Bitcoin and we'll store it handily
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:36.500]   on our servers for you and you won't have to worry about this.
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:42.300]   And then like it all vanishes overnight somewhere and the price of Bitcoin crashes for a couple
[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:43.300]   of clicks.
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:48.540]   But that doesn't- that's not really a blockchain because blockchain is more than just that,
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:49.540]   right?
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:56.540]   Well, so the point of the blockchain, this is how I can get the description of the blockchain.
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:01.420]   So the blockchain is a register of who has which Bitcoins?
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:02.420]   Aha.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:04.500]   It's a decentralized central bank.
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:05.980]   Well, it's kind of decentralized.
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:09.460]   It's actually a transaction log.
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:15.860]   It's basically every Bitcoin client has a copy of the entire chain.
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:21.460]   And when you want to do a transaction with Bitcoin, you send your transaction in sign
[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:26.860]   with your private key saying, "I want to transact this and feed that into the system."
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:34.900]   The miners then construct a block of transactions put together and then they do the math brute
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:39.820]   force nonsense to generate the signature to say, "This is the new block," and they're
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.180]   competing to do that.
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:46.340]   So in parallel, there are millions of variations on a theme being generated that contain some
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:47.780]   of these transactions.
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:52.300]   When someone actually solves a puzzle and gets enough zeros in the hash, then they say,
[01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:54.380]   "Here's a block."
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:56.780]   You can build on top of that.
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:38:00.100]   And as that percolates through the system, eventually everyone will start building on
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.980]   that block.
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:06.540]   Each block has to contain a hash of the previous blocks.
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:08.740]   So therefore, it is all hash back to the beginning.
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:12.580]   So each one is provably in sequence after those.
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:15.660]   But the actual sequence is speculative until this is locked down.
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:17.820]   The miners are fighting over that.
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:23.340]   And so the transaction time is not just one block time, which is 10 minutes, but to be
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:26.500]   sure your transaction has actually gone through, you have to wait several blocks to be on top
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:29.540]   of it so unwinding it is too expensive to redo.
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:33.980]   So that's the principle of Bitcoin and how it's centralized.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:39.660]   It's basically there are miners burning computer power to try and find the key that others will
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:47.260]   accept and therefore they will get the minted coins for generating that transaction.
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:51.020]   But this can be used for much more than money.
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:57.980]   And it also means that everyone who is using Bitcoin directly has to have a copy of the
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:58.980]   entire blockchain.
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:01.820]   Which is not good because how big is that?
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:04.020]   It's growing.
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:05.580]   It's a few gigs.
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:09.940]   So it's growing by a fixed amount every 10 minutes.
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:11.340]   We're growing by a meg every 10 minutes.
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:14.180]   And there's a fight going on that they're saying we need to make the block size bigger
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:17.580]   so we can get more transaction and otherwise it's going to overflow.
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:19.100]   And there's all kinds of stuff going like that.
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:22.140]   So that's the sort of the core Bitcoin thing.
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:27.940]   Now there's other bits and pieces inside Bitcoin that lets you do.
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:32.780]   So the basic thing is as a register of who has which Bitcoin but you can also put some
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:34.020]   information in those blocks as well.
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:37.340]   People said, "Oh, we can use this as a public database that everyone shares that solves
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:38.340]   this information."
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:41.620]   It's like, well you can but you're requiring it for use to solve that information.
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:45.140]   So if you start uploading stuff into that, that's going to be annoying.
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:46.140]   It's not very efficient.
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:49.860]   You're basically using space for that data that could be used for other transactions.
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:55.340]   So you're in some ways effectively under the mining system costing people money there.
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:40:01.780]   And so there are these various side chains ideas that what they put into the blockchain
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:07.460]   is a sort of marker for the state of this other database that's out there.
[01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:12.420]   So it can be verified by the blockchain that that thing has been updated but it's updated
[01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:14.540]   by a different mechanism.
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:16.660]   So I think it goes.
[01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:19.140]   I haven't poked into it in great depth.
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:26.860]   And part of its goal is to let you have programmable transactions in it so you can set things
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:28.940]   up that will trade under certain rules.
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:32.260]   So you can build your own rule-based things in it.
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:37.140]   I have not played with this enough to understand it because it's like a bunch of extra work
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:39.260]   you have to do to do this.
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:45.860]   And the challenge it has is the same as the challenge of Bitcoin is that is mostly a user
[01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:51.740]   experience problem which is actually using these things is annoying and fiddly and hard.
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:57.580]   And when you try and simplify because it's trying to do these crypto things and when you
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:04.420]   try and simplify that for normal people then you have to leave those stages out and then
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:07.740]   then they're not actually getting security that they thought they were.
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:13.180]   And that's been the continuous battle with Bitcoin and blockchain ongoing.
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:19.020]   So I spent a chunk of time understanding this last year and I haven't spent as much time
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:21.260]   on it this year so things will have changed since I did that.
[01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:28.980]   But my question was this is actually has a bunch of awkward failure modes that make
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:30.660]   it unlikely to do well.
[01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:37.220]   One of which is it is actually very hard to use and it's intrinsically hard to use.
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:44.060]   It's very hard to build an alternative to Bitcoin because the miners exist in the Bitcoin realm.
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:48.500]   They have rooms full of machines that can brute force hashes.
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:52.860]   So you can't build a separate blockchain using the same model because they will brute force
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:56.820]   you instantly and take over your blockchain because the amount of compute per pound needed
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:42:02.260]   for the Bitcoin blockchain is now so high that any other one you do can be swamped instantly
[01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:05.940]   by it unless you end up using something some different math that they can't accelerate
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:09.020]   yet but then you're basically getting into that arms race.
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:17.260]   The other thing is that there's a lack of centralization there in that it is centralized
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:22.060]   by the cartels of people who have rooms full of hash cracking machines.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:28.860]   The other centralization point is that they need to be running the same code or very close
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:31.780]   to the same code to actually interoperate and have this make sense.
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:37.420]   So the politics of changing a code has been complicated and that's where the fight over
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:39.020]   block sizes has been going on.
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:44.820]   So there what you see is effectively different contributors to an open source project arguing
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:49.620]   over the direction of that project and that sort of reveals again that there's a small
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:53.660]   number of people who decide in the direction of this.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:54.940]   Thank you.
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:43:02.380]   So someone in the chat is giving us a nice one cent of some of what Ethereum actually
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:03.380]   is.
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:04.380]   Shall I read that?
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:10.860]   James says Ethereum is a combination of blockchain database decentralized storage with incentives
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:17.740]   for storage providers, decentralized massaging with incentives and smart contracts to program
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:18.740]   business logic.
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:25.460]   It is a decentralized finance system on AWS.
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:31.620]   Meanwhile, T-Mobile is writing a manual on how to f up the internet.
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:33.460]   I love this.
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:38.500]   Thank you for writing this article in the Verge TC SOTIC.
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:44.260]   Because I think we mentioned this and a lot of people celebrated T-Mobile's announcement
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:45.420]   of Bin John.
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:51.220]   This is the ability to watch as much video as you want on some selected networks without
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:53.100]   going against your bandwidth cap.
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:44:01.420]   That includes of course Netflix, HBO Go, ESPN Showtime, but not YouTube.
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:09.740]   And as TC points out, this isn't exactly what people were worried about without net neutrality
[01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:17.300]   is that incumbents like T-Mobile would get to decide who has a free and fast lane to you
[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:18.900]   and who doesn't.
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:22.380]   We talked about this at length on Twitter on Sunday with Jeff.
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:26.380]   So I won't go over this again too much.
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:30.460]   We've got to apply and see if they would let us in, I guess that would reassure me a little
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:31.820]   bit.
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:37.460]   I worry a little more about the next Netflix and how they're going to fare because of course
[01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:42.540]   if you've got free bandwidth on Netflix, why would you look at the next Netflix?
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:48.740]   The thing you raised is on Twitter is that this makes trying to fight for net neutrality
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:51.740]   really hard and really hard to explain people.
[01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:54.020]   I can't get free use of Netflix.
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:55.020]   What are you doing to me?
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:56.900]   Yeah, this is not my interest.
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:45:01.260]   This net neutrality thing means I don't get free Netflix.
[01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:02.660]   And I understand that.
[01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:03.660]   People are mad.
[01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:05.300]   We love Bin John.
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:09.700]   So sometimes it's hard to explain why this is not in your interest even though it appears
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:14.660]   to be, which is probably exactly what T-Mobile's hoping.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:16.740]   Rick Condatra has gotten a new job.
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:21.820]   He was the guy who championed Google+, then left Google.
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:28.620]   He's a long time Microsoft employee, went to Google, left Google after Larry Page stepped
[01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:30.100]   upstairs into Alphabet.
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:33.540]   Actually, we haven't before then, but I think he saw the writing on the wall.
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:39.740]   He's now announced he's going to go to work for an interesting company that makes a electro
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:45.020]   cardiogram for iPhones.
[01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:49.140]   It is FDA approved, which is interesting.
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:55.980]   So it's a smartphone connected heart monitor from a company called the Live Core.
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:57.620]   And he'll be the new CEO there.
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:58.820]   A bunch of shorties.
[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:00.700]   Here's some really good news.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:03.500]   Amazon has announced two-step verification.
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.500]   I don't know why it took him so long.
[01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:06.500]   I didn't see that.
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:12.180]   But you know, we've always advocated that if a company offers two-step to use it, Google
[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:15.500]   does, of course, so does Facebook, so does Twitter.
[01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:21.860]   Amazon kind of late to the party, but better late than never.
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:24.820]   I haven't set it up, but I'm going to turn it on.
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:29.340]   And I don't want to do that on screen because it might give away some of my personal information.
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:32.660]   But it will require you an under unique security code.
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:36.060]   In addition to your password, you go to your account.
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:37.060]   I guess I can show you.
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:39.220]   You can use all like Authy against all these, right?
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:41.180]   Yeah, Authy or Google Authenticator.
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:43.820]   They specifically mention Google Authenticator.
[01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:46.740]   But if it's a Google Authenticator, that means Authy will work too because that's a standard
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:48.540]   for authentication.
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:54.620]   Go to your account, change account settings, edit, advance security settings, and get started.
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:56.540]   Good.
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:47:01.100]   You can add a backup phone number, which I think is a good idea, so that they can text
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:02.180]   you security codes.
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:07.100]   You can also use an authenticator app, if you wish.
[01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:12.820]   Now, for you guys, do you use mobile bank apps and do any of them use two-step?
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:13.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:14.820]   They do.
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:15.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:22.140]   All of them that I've used do, I use USAA, Chase and Bank of America, and all of them
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:24.380]   have fairly sophisticated authentication.
[01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:25.700]   Or that?
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:27.460]   I don't have them to use them.
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:28.460]   You don't use them.
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:29.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:31.140]   My wife handles all fact.
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:32.660]   Oh, aren't you lucky?
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:33.660]   Aren't you?
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:34.900]   You have a CEO.
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:37.020]   I have a wife as well, and she handles our...
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:41.020]   She pays the bills and all that because she knows if she left it in my hands.
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:42.020]   Exactly.
[01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:43.020]   At the end of the world?
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:44.500]   It was almost.
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:50.420]   I can't tell you how many times the power was turned off, the water was turned off.
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:55.020]   Oh, I think I forgot to pay that.
[01:47:55.020 --> 01:48:02.260]   Netflix is launching an open source project for ready for Amazon Google Cloud's additional
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:06.780]   deployment support for Microsoft Azure Active Laterway.
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:14.740]   It's called Spinnaker, and I guess it's a replacement for Netflix Asgard, which they
[01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:17.180]   use to manage AWS resources.
[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:18.180]   Hmm.
[01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:25.380]   Don't know if you'll be able to use it, but if you wanted, it's on GitHub.
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:29.300]   That's something we would use probably an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:34.060]   platform for leasing software changes with high velocity and confidence.
[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:36.140]   Thank you for open sourcing it, I guess.
[01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:38.980]   That's what I would say.
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:39.980]   Hmm.
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:42.900]   Hey, Jason.
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:45.740]   Have you heard anything about a date for Pixel C?
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:46.740]   I wanted so.
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:51.380]   I've heard nothing lately that has any sort of information about that.
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:52.380]   Come on, Google.
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:53.380]   Send us an XSC.
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:55.820]   And it'd be weird if we got into December and we still hadn't heard about it.
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:58.420]   They said buy Christmas by the holidays.
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.420]   Yeah.
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:00.420]   Yeah.
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:04.300]   I haven't heard anything official though about it.
[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:09.060]   Having now used the iPad Pro for a week, it's too damn big.
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.060]   It really is too big.
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:16.580]   Well, it's a step back to the classic iPad where you have to have a sofa to use it.
[01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:17.580]   Yeah.
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:22.020]   But I'm going to send my mom for Christmas because she's an artist and she loves to draw
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:24.140]   and I think she would get a lot out of it.
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:25.980]   So for some people, it makes perfect sense.
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:26.980]   Oh, no.
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:31.740]   I mean, in this same way that the big iPad that, it didn't happen a while to realize
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:34.580]   that an iPad this size was a good idea.
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:35.580]   Right.
[01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:36.580]   Didn't it?
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:37.580]   Remember, we all loved seven inch iPads.
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:38.580]   They could all come a little bit of the head by a different image.
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:39.580]   Or seven inch tablets.
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:40.580]   Yeah.
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:44.020]   Because the seven inch tablets is a perfect form factor for something you can use with
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:46.020]   one hand and public transit.
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:49.700]   Which no Apple engineer does, so they didn't think of it.
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:55.100]   But the big iPad has a lot of value in that it is a very, very high-resolution screen
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:57.820]   and it's very good for stuff where you've got high-dated entities.
[01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:02.380]   So it is good for reading scientific papers and doing data veers.
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:06.540]   And the pen thing is, from what I've seen from people's experience with it, they like
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:07.540]   it a lot.
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:09.980]   They've got the latency down very low and the pressure thing seems to work.
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:16.820]   So people are getting very nice drawing effects from rent compared to the surface stuff that
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:20.060]   Microsoft have which hasn't quite closed that loop to the same degree.
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:24.060]   Makes me wish that I were an artist.
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:29.900]   But it's a weird product because of the price point.
[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:36.180]   So it's like the price of a large number of Chromebooks.
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:38.100]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:42.140]   Some tips, some predictions, some numbers, whatever, you know, whatever back of the book
[01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:45.140]   material you'd like to throw in.
[01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:49.700]   But first a word for those of you on pager duty.
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:51.780]   Don't hate the pager man.
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:52.780]   Hate the game.
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:54.780]   No, don't hate the...
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:57.420]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:00.580]   Or another way to put it, is your sass on the line?
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:06.060]   Pager duty is an operations performance platform.
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:08.060]   You know what it is.
[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:11.540]   It's something that will get alerts to the right engineer at the right time, the person
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:14.740]   on call on pager duty.
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:19.340]   But because they've added some really nice features, it does more.
[01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:24.780]   It lets you increase the uptime of your apps, of your servers, of your websites and databases.
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:25.780]   How does it work?
[01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:27.300]   Well, let me explain.
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:30.380]   Pager duty connects all your systems into a single view.
[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:33.340]   You can see critical events across all your monitoring tools.
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:37.860]   Not just, you know, pager duty, but Nagios, new relic, keynote app dynamics.
[01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:40.900]   They've got APIs that will work with anything.
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:44.700]   And they have a hundred ready to use integrations out there.
[01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:49.020]   When an incident occurs, pager duty notifies the right team and the right member based upon
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:50.220]   on call schedules.
[01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:51.220]   It's smart.
[01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:53.660]   It knows who's on call right now.
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:58.700]   And does it in the way that team member prefers personalized alerting preferences?
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:03.300]   And then if an alert is missed, pager duty automatically escalates to another team member
[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:07.860]   and continues to do so until it's responded to.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:11.260]   This is just what you need.
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:13.540]   Alerts can be dispatched by everything.
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:15.300]   Of course, text and pages.
[01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:21.460]   Yes, some people still use pages, but also automated phone calls, email, push notifications.
[01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:23.420]   You can resolve an instance on the go.
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:24.420]   You can live your life.
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:25.820]   Yes, Slack uses pager duty.
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:26.980]   Everybody uses pager duty.
[01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:29.340]   All wing uses pager duty.
[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:30.860]   Decrease the noise.
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:36.180]   Incidents are delivered, automatically filtered and de-duped so that only actionable alerts
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:37.180]   are delivered.
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:38.180]   I love that.
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:43.180]   You don't get 18 alerts from the same problem.
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:46.700]   And now here's where it can help you improve your performance.
[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:49.500]   They have analytic tools that will identify common problems.
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:54.860]   So you can proactively make system improvements and prevent future outlet outages.
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:58.180]   So if you're on pager duty, you want the boss to get this.
[01:52:58.180 --> 01:53:01.620]   It'll mean you get fewer calls, fewer alerts.
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:05.940]   And of course, needless to say, pager duty is relentless when it comes to reliability.
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:11.420]   Fully distributed, multiple data centers, multiple hosting providers, multiple contact
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:15.820]   method providers for every method, you're not going to miss an alert.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:18.860]   And of course, you can customize it to fit how your team works.
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:20.140]   Microsoft uses it.
[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:21.140]   GitHub uses it.
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:23.620]   Nike, Pinterest, Box, Slack.
[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:25.460]   They all use it.
[01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:26.460]   Hip chat.
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:29.060]   I want you to use it.
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:31.060]   Visit pagerduty.com/twit.
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:32.540]   Sign up for a 14-day trial.
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:36.220]   Tell your boss whoever's in charge of this that is going to make their life better.
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:37.500]   It's going to make your life better.
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:40.660]   And it's as little as $19 a month.
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:45.540]   PagerDuty, P-A-G-E-R-D-U-T-Y.com/twit.
[01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:49.940]   And we thank pager duty.
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:50.940]   PagerDuty.
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:57.820]   Kevin, you already mentioned it, but you got a thing here, the indie web camp coming up.
[01:53:57.820 --> 01:53:58.820]   Second anniversary.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:00.060]   First of all, congratulations.
[01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:01.540]   Thank you.
[01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:02.540]   That's nice.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:05.580]   Anything else you want to plug away at?
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:07.860]   You're always full of wonderful stuff.
[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:09.340]   I was thinking about that.
[01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:11.060]   I'm trying to put what else.
[01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:12.060]   What else do you like?
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:14.580]   I've been using your Insta weather watch face.
[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:15.580]   I love that.
[01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:16.580]   Sorry.
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:17.580]   Yeah, we have a little light.
[01:54:17.580 --> 01:54:19.580]   It is good, isn't it?
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:20.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:24.980]   It's been really useful recently because we've had these sudden bursts of rain.
[01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:26.980]   I was looking at my witch going, "Oh, right.
[01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:28.540]   I need to take the umbrellas down.
[01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:29.540]   There's rain coming tomorrow."
[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:30.540]   Yeah, I gave them some money.
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:32.740]   I thought this was great.
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:41.540]   Well, I mean, one of the things we're working on with indie web at the moment is I was saying
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:44.420]   be able to do stuff on your own site and be able to translate it to and from the other
[01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:45.620]   sites.
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:50.420]   What often ends up with that is we end up moving things between sites that they can't
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:51.420]   do themselves.
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:52.420]   Right.
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:56.260]   One example of that is own your gram, which is...
[01:54:56.260 --> 01:54:57.260]   I know.
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:54:58.260]   I'm so sad.
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:54:59.260]   I think that's...
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:01.980]   Do you want to be hurt by this?
[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:02.980]   I don't think...
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:08.220]   So, own your gram, which I actually spoke, Instagram.com is you sign in with your Instagram
[01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:09.220]   account.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:11.060]   Then when you take a photograph, it will post it to your own blog.
[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:12.060]   Right.
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:13.060]   So you have...
[01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:15.660]   And I've been using this on my known site.
[01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:20.540]   They work on the... and you can make it work with others using siloed up, which is a bridge
[01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:26.900]   that will translate indie web into blogger and tumblr and so on.
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:28.540]   But the other thing that...
[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:29.860]   But the other thing that...
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:30.860]   By doing...
[01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:35.420]   By combining these two things, by using own your gram and then using siloed up pub with
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:37.420]   Twitter, you can get it to post...
[01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:41.460]   You can get your Instagrams to post as Twitter as photographs, which is something that they
[01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:44.100]   don't do because they're fighting with each other.
[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:48.820]   But by translating back and forth through an indie web, we can bridge that through.
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:52.580]   And so the next thing that we're looking at in the moving photographs between sites,
[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:58.740]   we showed you the swap zero demo a while back where we had the ability to tag people
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:02.500]   on your own website and other people discover it on their own websites and work through
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:03.500]   that.
[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:09.560]   We're now working on combining that model of tagging people in photographs with the
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:10.560]   siloed websites.
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:15.840]   So the ability to tag somebody on my website and have that propagate to Facebook or to
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.240]   Instagram and then potentially to bridge these kinds of person tagging photographs between
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:21.520]   the sites as well.
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:26.400]   So that's actively being hacked on at the moment in the indie web group.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.440]   I think we may have some of that working tonight at Homebrew.
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:36.560]   And we should have done this by indie web camp in December.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:40.520]   The point of this is continuing this process of what are the things we're trying to do
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:45.080]   and how do we do them for ourselves in the simplest way possible.
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:49.520]   And then how do we bridge those back and forth between the places that our friends
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:51.960]   are already?
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:57.200]   And we've seen that with the, you know, with, known as it is a great example.
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:01.200]   It's known posting to Twitter is very transparent.
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.440]   And the reply is coming back to you.
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.240]   So you can sit there and post back and forth.
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:12.040]   The other one is the indie reader would win that I use.
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:17.360]   That has the ability to like and retweet and star.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:23.320]   Or I suppose the now should be hard posts and therefore that propagates to my site and
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:25.720]   can potentially propagate back out to other sites as well.
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:30.280]   So there's this sort of confluence of these different pieces plugging together.
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:34.440]   And the moment there are, there's some configurations set up to plug these pieces together.
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:37.400]   So there is some overhead that but that's getting simpler with time.
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:43.120]   So there is a lot going on with that and it's worth looking at it.
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:48.720]   Even if you have your own WordPress site or other sites like that, we've got a series
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:52.840]   of plug-ins and things that help you put this stuff together.
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:54.880]   I love it.
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:56.960]   And I'm a fan.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:58.600]   indiewebcamp.com.com.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:57:59.600]   Yes.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:07.600]   And also, the other one I will mention is indiewebify.me.
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:12.640]   And that one does is it walks you through, if you've got your own site, marking it up
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:21.440]   so that more web stuff on your site can interoperate with the indie web stuff.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:26.200]   So it walks you through the different pieces of marking your site up so you can log in,
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:31.440]   adding the ability to mark your post-up so they show up as replies and so on.
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:37.880]   And basically, it's just put your own in and it says, "Okay, you've got this thing,
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:39.640]   you've got this thing, you've got this thing, you haven't got this thing."
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:41.960]   If you put "known" in it, it'll say, "Oh, you've got all these things."
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:45.160]   If you put WordPress in, it'll say, "You've got some of this, but here's the things you
[01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:46.520]   could change to improve this."
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:54.720]   So it's sort of incrementally, it's like helping you test out these pieces as we have them.
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:55.720]   This is great.
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:59.240]   Yeah, but the trouble with own your gram is, the other thing that Instagram have said
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:02.240]   is you can't use the word gram in the name of your product.
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:06.800]   So everyone's going to have to own your gram and paste the gram and what else, even if
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:09.240]   they can keep the running, which is kind of annoying.
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:12.000]   Look at that.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:13.320]   I'm not getting your feed.
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:15.760]   Oh, I pull it out by accident.
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:19.320]   So this is something that indieweb really needed, which was just kind of like a tester.
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:20.320]   Yes.
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:25.760]   And I really like this and then just a place to find out how to do these various things,
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:27.200]   the well done me and all that stuff.
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:28.200]   This is great.
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:31.880]   So this was actually built a couple of years ago, but it's just been updated recently and
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:34.840]   now it's more people can edit it.
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:36.920]   So we're hopefully making this better over time.
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:37.920]   I love it.
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:38.920]   indiewebify.me.
[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:41.240]   I have a couple of things.
[01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:46.160]   You probably saw that, well, let's start with your number, Jeff, and then I'll do mine.
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:47.160]   Okay.
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:48.560]   I found this interesting.
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:56.800]   Forbes Forbes staffer said that out of the 500 companies and the S&P 500, five companies
[01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:00.600]   have collective returns that account for more than the entire return of the index year
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:01.600]   to date.
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:02.600]   Wow.
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:10.080]   Amazon alphabet slash Google Microsoft Facebook and as an odd one in their general electric.
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:13.920]   Without them, the S&P would be down 2.2% this year.
[02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:18.520]   Instead, it's virtually flat at interesting 0.1% and 0.1%.
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:19.520]   Interesting.
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:24.920]   And that's how important those stocks are to our perception of how the economy is doing.
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:25.920]   Very interesting.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:26.920]   I thought that interesting.
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:27.920]   Yeah.
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:29.080]   I have a number two.
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:31.280]   Do you mind if I step on your numbers?
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:32.280]   Please do.
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:33.280]   I'm done with my numbers.
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:34.280]   They're all free for grabbing.
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:43.120]   I have a number 12 billion, 667 million, 612,066 dollars.
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:49.200]   And this is the value of asset for future recoveries by US authorities from 1989 to
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.200]   2010.
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:52.520]   And they've been going up 19 and a half percent a year.
[02:00:52.520 --> 02:01:02.280]   This is the civil asset forfeiture law that allows law enforcement to confiscate assets
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:07.920]   even without an arrest or criminal charge.
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:14.360]   And I don't know, remember the good wife where there was a guy patrolling a particular corridor
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:19.200]   of road because drug dealers were often driving.
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:24.160]   He didn't patrol the south or the northbound, just the southbound.
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:26.600]   This northbound was the drug dealers coming back with the drugs.
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:31.440]   The southbound was them driving down to get the drugs and they had all their cash.
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:34.320]   And so he made sure he made those arrests and took the cash.
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:38.640]   It is a huge source of profit for police departments.
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:48.160]   In 2008 law enforcement took one and a half billion dollars in 2014, $4.5 billion, but
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:50.600]   get this and this is the headline.
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:59.000]   According to the FBI, victims of burglary offenses in 2014 lost $3.9 billion in property
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.240]   losses.
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:06.760]   You're losing more money to law enforcement now than to all U.S. burglars combined.
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:08.760]   Jesus.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:14.760]   John Oliver did that on last week tonight, so you might want to watch that episode.
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:20.560]   More money due to civil asset forfeiture to law enforcement become a profit center for
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:21.560]   law enforcement.
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:25.440]   Talk about a moral hazard.
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:28.400]   More than in all burglaries combined.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.960]   And those numbers come from the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI.
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:37.920]   I'm not making them up.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:39.920]   That's just stunning.
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:42.360]   Anyway, I'll leave you.
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:46.000]   Oh, I have one more thing and actually I got this on Google+, but I like it.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.160]   You know the ultimate fighting championship UFC?
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:54.600]   They have a problem because the fights tend to be short, easily jiffable.
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:58.840]   And so they've really had to go on a Twitter and do takedowns because people are posting
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:03.360]   basically the entire fight in animated gifs on their Twitter feed.
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:07.920]   And the money, of course, is from the pay per view, but why watch a pay per view?
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:10.640]   So this was a one, this was a big shock.
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:17.280]   Rousey, who is the queen of ultimate fighting championship, got taken down in 52 seconds
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:18.280]   by home.
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:23.840]   You can't post the video, but I can show you somebody made a street fighter edition of
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:26.400]   the Rousey versus home fight.
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:27.400]   Any audio?
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:29.880]   Well, you don't really need the audio.
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:32.600]   I think you'll enjoy it.
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.960]   This is a reenactment.
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:38.440]   A reenactment of the fight.
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:41.120]   And in fact, it only took 52 seconds.
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:42.120]   She's out.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.120]   Oh, not quite.
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:44.120]   Wait a minute.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:45.200]   One more time.
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:46.280]   And boom.
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:56.120]   And if you paid $90 for the pay per view, my son watches UFC.
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.960]   I don't watch it, but he says, no, it's worth it.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:02.080]   It's worth it because you got the lead up and you got all the excitement.
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:08.480]   Thank you, Richie Branson for creating that video.
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:12.200]   Should we, we didn't, we should, we, I mentioned it on Twitter.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:14.560]   The Google car getting stopped for driving too slow.
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:16.560]   I just think we have to have that for the record here.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:19.400]   For completeness.
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:21.680]   So the self-driving car apparently is limited.
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:26.600]   They don't want to scare people is limited to 25 miles an hour.
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:28.800]   Well, it's not a golf car, isn't it?
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:29.800]   Yeah.
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:30.800]   It would scare people.
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:31.800]   Yeah.
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:32.800]   Yeah.
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:34.280]   If you go around 50 miles an hour.
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:37.360]   So apparently it was, it was driving around.
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:40.760]   I'm out of view holding up traffic in a 35 mile an hour zone.
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:44.560]   So a Mountain View Police Department officer pulled it up.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:48.720]   The officer noticed traffic backing up behind a slow moving car in the eastbound lane.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:52.520]   The officer stopped the car, made contact with the operators to learn more about how
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:57.400]   it was choosing speeds along certain roadways and who educate officers about impeding traffic.
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:03.000]   There wasn't a driver, but fortunately there was a passenger who explained.
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.720]   A lot of peeved Tesla drivers behind it.
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:09.880]   Hey, hey, get out of the way, get out of the way.
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:10.880]   I can't.
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:12.880]   I'm not driving.
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:19.880]   The officer decided not to write a ticket after explaining the rules of the picture.
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:21.880]   It's just so great to have.
[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:24.880]   There's no one driving.
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:32.320]   Do you think they would have given an orientation to Mountain View cops since?
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:36.120]   Well, no, you would just stay off the higher speed streets.
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:37.120]   Yeah.
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:38.120]   Well, but yeah.
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:41.320]   But it's like 22 miles an hour is maximum speed for that.
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:46.920]   25 and they were in a 35 mile an hour zone, which means in Mountain View people are driving
[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:47.920]   50.
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:48.920]   Yeah.
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:49.920]   And grandma.
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:55.280]   Some of the night view streets are narrow and they're flashing their lights.
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:56.840]   They're honking their horn.
[02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:58.840]   My lower, my lower.
[02:05:58.840 --> 02:05:59.840]   I can't.
[02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:00.840]   I'm not driving.
[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:03.480]   Did you guys watch the good wife this weekend?
[02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:05.280]   I heard it was about self-driving cars.
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:06.280]   I have to watch it.
[02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:08.600]   It's still binge watching the season four.
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:10.320]   Yeah, I'm back in season four too.
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:11.320]   Yeah.
[02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:12.320]   And I won't talk about it.
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:14.400]   I savor it.
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:15.400]   Me too.
[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:16.400]   That's why I'm not done with it.
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:18.800]   We only watch, you know, we don't.
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:21.240]   It's such a, but it's also an easy going show.
[02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:28.200]   So when we, after we've watched Daredevil and Sense 8 and we just finished Fargo season
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:29.200]   one.
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:30.200]   Oh, season one.
[02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:31.200]   Yeah, that was fun.
[02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:32.200]   Oh my God.
[02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:35.280]   So after we watch all that ultra violence, we like to watch something relaxing.
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:36.280]   Like walking dead.
[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:37.280]   Yeah.
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:38.280]   The good wife.
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:39.280]   No zombies.
[02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:40.280]   Kind of get through.
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:41.280]   No wood shippers.
[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:42.280]   No hamburger crinders.
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:45.280]   But it was quite a lot of tech.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:48.280]   Yes, it's very, very smart.
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:52.280]   It didn't really Scott's son do that show.
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:54.280]   Yeah, it's one of his, Scott production.
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:55.280]   Yeah.
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:57.240]   Yeah, it's him and his son.
[02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:58.240]   So it is.
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:01.080]   They talk about Snowden stuff and encryption.
[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.080]   By the way, we don't.
[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:06.600]   So last week was about, had a hacking rate and stuff in it.
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:08.080]   And this week was about self driving cars.
[02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:10.200]   Yeah, that's very, I love it.
[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:13.640]   Ripped from the headlines, as they used to say.
[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:14.640]   Stories.
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:15.640]   But you see intelligent.
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:20.200]   You know, there's like CSI cyber, which is just like, Ripped from the headlines they're
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:21.200]   made into nonsense.
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:22.200]   Right.
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:24.760]   Whereas this, this is actually, there's a complicated legal issue here and we got to
[02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:25.760]   explore it.
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:27.920]   It's a smart show, which I really enjoy.
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:28.920]   I know what I want.
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:29.920]   I want to chop.
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:34.400]   I want to put in the rundown a chum hum t-shirt for Christmas.
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:35.400]   That's what I want.
[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:37.880]   Chum hum is the Facebook clone that is prominent.
[02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:39.880]   Well, Facebook or Google or I'm not sure.
[02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:42.440]   It's kind of, it's, it's, it's their generic large tech company.
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.440]   Right.
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:44.440]   It's a client.
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:45.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:46.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:47.440]   Chum hum t-shirt.
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:48.440]   This weekend chum hum.
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:50.440]   I wouldn't mind a hooly t-shirt.
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:51.440]   I got one.
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:53.240]   Oh, nice.
[02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:56.920]   I went to the four square Lazard four square conference and they have a goody bag, which
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:59.520]   in the old days was a heck of a goody bag.
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:02.600]   Got DVD players and all kinds of things.
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:04.760]   That's a lot for fictional companies.
[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:06.360]   I got a hooly t-shirt.
[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:07.360]   Yeah.
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:09.720]   Which I, I'm now rogering from for Jake.
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:10.720]   I said this would be a good one.
[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:11.720]   Oh, Jake.
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:13.520]   If I can start from for Jake, but my wife said, no, it's a white t-shirt.
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:14.520]   I'll never wear a white t-shirt.
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:15.520]   I said, I don't know.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:16.520]   It's a hooly t-shirt.
[02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:17.520]   It's pretty good.
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:22.320]   It's a hooly t-shirt.
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:26.400]   We could talk a little bit about encryption after in the wake of France.
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.400]   I did my bid.
[02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:30.480]   I was on, or I will be on Friday, the bill handles show.
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:33.240]   We prerecorded it on KFI in Los Angeles.
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:35.240]   Number one morning show in Los Angeles.
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.760]   And he says, you know, what are we going to do?
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:38.560]   The terrorists are using encryption.
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:41.640]   And by the way, Jake just signed up for Telegram.
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:45.880]   I'm guessing a lot more action on Telegram all of a sudden because it's one of the three
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:50.200]   apps that police speculate.
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:56.280]   Maybe possibly the terrorists use Telegram WhatsApp and three MAs of the three.
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:57.280]   So truly most secure.
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:03.520]   Well, they're also speculating that they use PlayStation 4 also speculation because they
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:04.520]   don't know.
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:08.520]   And they don't actually know because they're captured some this weekend, haven't they?
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:09.520]   Yeah.
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:10.520]   Well, they've got their cell phones.
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:11.520]   So they've got their cell phones.
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:12.880]   I'm just waiting for the story.
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:18.200]   Oh, we got their cell phones, but thanks, Apple, we can't find out what's on them.
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:20.240]   They're just scapegoating encryption.
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:21.960]   Well, we've had this.
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:23.160]   This is going out the moment.
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:27.600]   The UK is trying to pass this new person's charter, which is there every.
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:28.600]   Right.
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:36.200]   In a wonderfully Brazil-like touch, they said, oh, and your ISP bills will have to go up
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.040]   to pay for the data retention that we're requiring them to do because we're not going
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:41.960]   to pay the ISPs to do that.
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:44.880]   There's like, wait, you're making us pay more to retain data.
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:45.880]   Spine us.
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:46.880]   Enforcement.
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:47.880]   Yeah.
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:50.400]   And you also have GCHQ in the cable tab.
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:52.160]   It's not the day you've already got that.
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:53.160]   And I'm going to leave.
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:54.160]   It's like, hmm.
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:10:01.600]   But yeah, they were quick to shroud wave and say that these attacks were the fault of these
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:08.600]   encrypted systems because they want to pass laws that make no actual sense.
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:19.120]   They have literally said they want to have a way to break encryption as a legal requirement.
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:23.920]   And incidentally, this story just breaking on the intercept from Dan Frumkin signs point
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:27.800]   to unencrypted communications between terrorist subjects.
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:28.800]   Yeah.
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:29.800]   Suspects.
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:33.760]   Now we're going to have to ban unencrypted communications.
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:37.520]   That's the real what's really going on is, oh, we didn't know.
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:40.160]   We didn't do anything about it.
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:42.160]   And let's we need something to blame quick.
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:43.160]   Right.
[02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:46.560]   Frasal for our presidential candidates will allow Christians to have encrypted conversation.
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:48.720]   Only Christians can have encrypted conversations.
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:57.360]   Well, I mean, the thing is, it's like there are lots of ways to have secret conversations
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:00.760]   where they're like being in the same room without microphones in it.
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:01.760]   Right.
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:03.280]   What are we going to do about that?
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:05.640]   You know, there's there's book key ciphers.
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:06.640]   Right.
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:10.320]   You know, just a good agrophy and on the way.
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:12.400]   The terrorist plan, the attack with emojis.
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:15.560]   Well, that was one of the nonsense stories.
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:21.440]   It was like they picked up the communicating PS4s and said they could be communicating
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:24.760]   by laying out coins on the ground in Mario.
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:26.960]   Yes, they could.
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:29.160]   Yes, they could be doing that.
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:32.560]   They could be bouncing signals off the moon as well.
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:34.960]   Yes, it's like, OK.
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:41.040]   You know, there is an official chum hum t-shirt, by the way, available at the CBS store.
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.320]   If you it's not as good as the unofficial.
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:45.280]   It's from the eight.
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:46.280]   Say again?
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:52.920]   So Douglas Adams, I should get the exact quote so that I introduce him.
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:12:00.720]   But basically he said there's all this this fuss and worry that broadcasters say that this
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:04.600]   crime was banned was planned on over the internet.
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:07.880]   And they said in such a way as if it's a scary thing.
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:09.400]   Planned on the internet.
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:14.920]   The thing is you could say the same thing about it was planned over a cup of tea.
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:15.920]   Right.
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:22.360]   But somehow they don't doesn't mean they want to ban tea.
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:24.120]   Damn you, internet.
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:25.120]   Damn you.
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:30.560]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of the internet and you'll find him teaching at CUNY.
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:33.960]   So yes, I found the exact quote.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:34.960]   Hang on.
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:39.260]   It's I don't think anybody would argue now that the internet isn't becoming a major
[02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:40.260]   factor in our lives.
[02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:42.720]   Oh, it's very new to us.
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:46.320]   News readers still feel it is worth a special and rather worry you mentioned if for instance
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:49.000]   a crime was planned by people over the internet.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:53.440]   They don't have to mention when criminals use a telephone or the M4 or discuss their
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:55.200]   dusty plans over a cup of tea.
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:58.440]   But each of those was new and controversial in their day.
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:12:59.440]   Yep.
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:01.520]   This is Douglas Adams from 1999, which is which.
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:02.520]   1999.
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:04.280]   One of the best things he's written.
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:06.680]   Love him.
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:08.520]   Jeff Jarvis, thank you.
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:12.220]   Buzzmachine.com will be see you back here next Wednesday.
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:13.940]   Sorry, I was gone for two weeks.
[02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:17.900]   We missed you, but we're still glad you're back and we had him on Twit to because we missed
[02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:19.900]   him so much.
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:24.460]   Kevin Marks, we love having you on to just always always great.
[02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:25.460]   Thank you.

[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:30.300]   Oh, this was his article.
[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:31.700]   How to stop worrying and love the internet.
[02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:32.700]   I remember that.
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:33.700]   Yeah.
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:34.700]   Yeah.
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:35.700]   It's worth reading.
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:40.640]   This is 16 years old now, but it's spot on.
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:42.680]   That's really awesome.
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:45.560]   This is awesome.
