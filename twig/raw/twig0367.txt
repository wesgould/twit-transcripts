[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.440]   Show where we cover the latest news from the front.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.000]   I'm just going to say that.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.400]   From the front, whatever that might be to you.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.600]   Or Jeff Jarvis, Professor of J.I.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.640]   I can't be ready to serve a newty.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.320]   He's on the front lines of the journalism biz.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.840]   Nice to see you once again.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.840]   Welcome.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   Jeff, Professor of Journalism.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.880]   Your new studios, it was great to see you move.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.880]   I'm not going to deny that I would have liked to have stayed in the brick house because I
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.400]   really loved it.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.800]   But it was over big.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.520]   It was about two thirds bigger than we needed and it was over expensive.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.480]   And it was over because the company that owned it sold it into another company which
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.720]   is turning into a brewery.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.360]   So there was no choice.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.160]   And we found a nice little space.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.640]   I think when you get here, you'll see that it's different.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.360]   But it gets the job done.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.080]   That's all I care about.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.840]   I just got to make the shows happen here.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.240]   Jeff is the author of a number of wonderful books including What Would Google Do?
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.880]   That's how he got on the show in the first place.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.840]   But since then he's done public parts and Gutenberg, the geek and geek sparing gifts.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.520]   And he blogs at buzzmachine.com and medium.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.760]   And good, great post.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.240]   That's a plugster live, man.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.080]   I like throwing on the plugs.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   Well you do this.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   You do this.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.560]   You know, you sacrifice significant amount of time from your very busy schedule to be
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   here every week.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.520]   I thank you.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.240]   Also here, we're thrilled to have her.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.880]   The new star of the show, Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.880]   She is from StaceyOnIOT.com at Gigastacey and an expert in IOT, but also a long time
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.840]   observer of the tech industry in general.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.360]   So she is expert on all of this stuff.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.360]   You're our expert.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.920]   Gina Trepani was our expert.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.920]   You're our expert.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.920]   We're just blatherers.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.880]   Jeff and I are blatherers.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.720]   You come with the facts in hand.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   I try.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.120]   I try to keep you guys honest.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.680]   You do.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.080]   I like that.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.520]   So this was the week that Gawker died.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.840]   And of course, I thought a fairly self-serving eulogy from the founder of Gawker, Nick Denton
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.440]   in the New York Times.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.600]   Following an even more self-serving opinion piece from Peter Thiel in the New York Times,
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.200]   at least they got it covered, right?
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.480]   Actually, Dawkins, Denton's piece was on Gawker.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   Well, Gawker, I was going to say, yeah.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   Peter Thiel's on the New York Times.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.400]   Elizabeth Spire has wrote, and I thought, a much better piece than the Washington Post.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.840]   She was the former founding editor of the book.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.640]   The audio editor of Gawker, and then that I wrote one too.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.120]   And that's what brought me to this subject, is reading your medium piece, which I thought
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.320]   was really great.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.080]   And the bottom line, at the very end of the piece, I think, you said it very well.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.960]   And it applies both to Peter Thiel and to Gawker, which is power corrupts.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.680]   And that's the real lesson here, actually.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:45.800]   Both Peter Thiel and Gawker suffered from success in some ways of having too much power.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.920]   You know, it really got me thinking a lot about it.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.600]   So this happened last week.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.440]   I got to speak to all of our, I got to brainwash all of our new students at CUNY, at the J-School,
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.440]   a wonderful group.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.080]   And I began the week asking them to define journalism.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.560]   And there were 90 different definitions of journalism, and some really interesting.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.240]   And one really reminded me of Nick's own view, which is freedom for its own sake, that we
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.360]   destroy, we pull down, we upend institutions.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.080]   If that's the only reason that journalism exists, and then for that matter, that's the
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.840]   only reason the blogs exist and social media exist, why do we bother?
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.000]   If we're not also building up, if we're not also improving things, then just destroying,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   that's ridiculous.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.280]   And I think the same is true of cable news right now.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   It's let's do everything we can to tear it on everything.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.480]   And then we think, oh, good, our job is done.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.080]   Have we actually improved society in any way?
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.960]   And what are the new incoming students have what I thought was a brilliant definition
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   of journalism?
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.320]   If you really don't like that.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.040]   And I was very impressed that here she is a student, and I thought she encapsulated the
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.440]   role of journalism quite well.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.440]   I don't have it in front of me.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.440]   Do you have that?
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.440]   I can go further.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.440]   Yeah, I'll pull it up.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:05.320]   I want to quote a little more humorous quote from family Peter Dunn that the duty of a
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.280]   newspaper is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, which I've always
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   liked.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.600]   And I think Nick Denton used that as his motto.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.080]   But I think it leaves out the important, the essential piece that you, you know, you
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.440]   articulated something I felt, but I couldn't articulate.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.280]   And I was really glad to read your piece, which is that if it's fine to tear down, but
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.400]   you also need to build up.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.560]   You need to, you need to make the world a better, all of us need to make the world a
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.840]   better place, ultimately.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.760]   And failing that you, you know, all you are as a destroyer.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.040]   And so, so let me read her definition.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.040]   Do read her.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.040]   Yeah, I have your, I have your R.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.040]   Katie Ryan is her name.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   Kate Ryan.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.040]   Kate Ryan.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.040]   Let me see.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   It's in, it's in your medium piece, right?
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   Right.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   There.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.040]   It is a means to inform the public and in doing so, cultivate and educated empathetic
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.920]   and engage society.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.320]   It is a means to inform the public, but doesn't stop there.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.200]   And in doing so, cultivate an educated empathetic and engaged society.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.120]   It's actually not surprising a student would write that because I think that could be the
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.600]   motto, the second part of, of most schools and education to cultivate an educated sympathetic
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   and engage society.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.800]   Is journalist ultimately educational?
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.560]   I think I, I believe it should be.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.600]   I believe if we don't, you know, if you look at Brexit, I'll try to stay away from this
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.600]   election.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.480]   But if you look at Brexit, the problem was from now on, let's use Brexit as code for Trump.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.480]   Okay.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.480]   Perfect.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.480]   Perfect.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.480]   You know what we mean.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.960]   There's a little dog whistle there.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.960]   By the way, I'm surprised.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.160]   I actually looked online yesterday.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.240]   I'm surprised there are not Trump branded dog whistles.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.240]   It's the man.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.240]   Right.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.240]   Hold on.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.080]   Let me, let me make that happen.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   Please do.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.880]   By the time the show is over, delivered by real opportunity.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.960]   So, so, so the other thing that occurred to me, there's one more point and you're going
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.880]   to hear what Stacy thinks about all those two is that when Elizabeth Spire has talked
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.040]   about this, she saw the story of, in the story of Gawker, she saw the story of blogs.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.760]   She started blogging before I did 99.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.040]   I started blogging in 2001.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.400]   And Lord knows I've said things I've not been proud of.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.320]   There've been moments when I had plenty of snark and fits and feuds and so on.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.720]   But then it stopped being fun anymore.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.160]   We got it out of our system, I thought.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.240]   And, and you know, I wonder whether the death of Gawker is kind of the death of blogs that
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.880]   we went to a supernova that it became the best and the worst of everything we could have
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.880]   had.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.960]   And you know, this within a week of each other area on a Huffington who started a blog company
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.600]   leaves and goes out of media and Nick Denton leaves and goes out of media.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.560]   And the mass media business model that drove Gawker to do what it did to get more page
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.880]   views, page views, page views.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.040]   Let's put the most outrageous crap we can up to get the most page views we can get.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.880]   And we saw that ended up ruining lives.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.760]   And that's where this went.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:10.480]   And so there was to me a moment of reflection, not just about Gawker, but about blogs, social
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.560]   media, the net and journalism itself.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   Stacy.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.560]   Wow.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.560]   Heavy.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.520]   That's so heavy.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.360]   I'm like, dang.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.280]   Okay.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.840]   I think the people who embraced blogs early on were maybe not in the Hunter S. Thompson
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.240]   vein, but I think journalism goes through that and we have gone so journalists.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.040]   Thank you.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.640]   There was a bit of that in blogging and it felt free and fun because the internet was
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.120]   no rules.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.160]   But I don't think this is the death of blogging.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.480]   I think blogging has irrevocably changed journalism.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:57.560]   You gone as this ideal of objectivity and we can argue if journalism is really objective
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.520]   or not, but that's like a journalism class kind of thing.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:09.400]   And now we're seeing, hopefully, big publications pull some of the best aspects of blogs, I
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.120]   think, in asking for crowdsourced and community kind of participation on project.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.560]   If you look at how public is changing.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:24.400]   And then I would also argue that we are still in a world where journalism and the best journalism
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.600]   is empathetic and builds the community.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.640]   And I would point to the New York Times, just that quick thing and well, their well column
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.920]   about epipins and the cost.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.480]   That's one of the biggest stories of this week.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.480]   Isn't that huge?
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.480]   Yes.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.520]   So that is a wonderful example of a paper still doing that type of work and then everyone
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.520]   latching onto it.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.000]   It's a tightrope though between objectivity and advocacy.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.640]   I mean, to some degree, that was an advocacy piece, right?
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.640]   It took an opinion.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.480]   It had a voice.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.920]   All journalism starts at a level of advocacy.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.520]   You're going to stand up for just just freedom, the little guy, what's fair.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:12.040]   So you're saying your goal should be to get to the truth and improve life and improve
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.040]   life.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:20.680]   I would say as a tech reporter who's done this, like reported on technology for years, I've
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.480]   had two goals of arching goals.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.840]   One is for the consumer.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:32.680]   So as someone who buys and plays with or whatever and relies on technology in life,
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:38.040]   I do, I advocate, like if you read my stories about broadband, you will see I have a clearer
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.400]   position on all of this.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.000]   But I also do the research and I made a point of understanding the technical underpinnings
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.880]   of anything I advocate for.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.840]   I feel like a lot of journalists don't necessarily take that second step and I think that's
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:12:00.760]   the most important part because otherwise you just have opinions unfounded by anything
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.760]   you sell.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.200]   There's trade press versus regular journalism.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.640]   You and I come from trade press and the risk there is the risk that the New York Times
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.160]   doesn't face but is to be co-opted, I guess they do face it in beltway journalism, to
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.440]   be co-opted by the people you're covering.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.000]   So it's really good I think for a tech gen.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.480]   I'm completely with you.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.840]   In fact, I learned that lesson from Jerry Pournell and his chaos corner, chaos, manner
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.320]   column in BITE magazine, which was so different from all the other tech writing that was going
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.440]   on in the 80s because he took the point of view of the user.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:38.640]   He was a user and he reported back as the user and the user really almost in opposition
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.800]   to the tech companies, fighting for the user over the tech companies.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.280]   And so in trade press, I think that you're absolutely right.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.520]   That's a vital, very important distinction.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.520]   I don't know how that applies.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.520]   I think it absolutely applies.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.960]   I think it absolutely does.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:59.840]   Let me try not to get too controversial right now, but as has been obvious, I'm transparent
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.840]   about this.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.840]   I've been transparent about this since 2008.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.960]   I support Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.440]   And I decided to go and kind of embed and live this.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.240]   I haven't written this up yet.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.800]   But last weekend I went down and I volunteered in Philadelphia, in West Philadelphia, and
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   I went out and registered voters and I drove people around and they even did a little bit
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   of canvassing.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   So I can hear people should do that.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.400]   That is such a vital perspective on what's going on.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.920]   You know, I did it as a partisan.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.920]   I am a partisan.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.480]   I am for Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.720]   Make no doubt about that.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.000]   Holy Ramos, Univision said that, you know, it's like World War II.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   What did you do in the war, daddy?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.520]   What did you do during the Trump time, daddy?
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.560]   People are going to make their own decisions and whatever those decisions are.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.160]   That's what democracy is about is to be able to express them.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.240]   But to the point now, this is where I don't kick people in trouble, but I got Breitbarted
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.240]   yesterday.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.240]   So it can't be any worse than that.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.240]   You got Breitbarted?
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.640]   Oh, Alicia, the dogs of Trump.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   Oh my God.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.360]   Oh, I got to read that.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   Maybe my daddy.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.360]   Don't start it again.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.360]   Don't start it again.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:02.120]   I'll tell you what it was.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.800]   There was a discussion on Brian Stelter's show on CNN on Sunday about why Hillary Clinton
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.000]   is not doing press conferences because that's the meme do-jures.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.920]   And I said, well, consider the S show that would be with the, you know, all the push
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.240]   about nothing but email and foundations and nothing about issues.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.160]   You know, can you blame her for not doing this?
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.760]   Oh, I was accused of just excusing her.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.600]   The journalists went after me because I wasn't standing up for the property of press conferences
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   Uber, Alice.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.480]   The press conferences are S dot dot dot shows.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.240]   They don't accomplish much interviews, accomplish much more.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.320]   And then of course, the Trump is when after me, because I was in Clinton.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.320]   But that aside.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:47.760]   But that is in my microcosm is what's kind of happened to journalism.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:53.640]   I mean, it's gone so far beyond advocacy journalism to being kind of like polarizing
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.000]   point of view journalism and punditry.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.440]   Yeah, but it's worse than that Leo.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.280]   And then there's the other side of it.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.440]   Your friend, your colleague Jay Rosen is always bemoaning the the fate, the foe balance
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:11.280]   journalism where you, no matter how ridiculous the point of view is you get both sides equally
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.400]   equal time.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.760]   But that, you know, I don't know.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.960]   I'm glad I don't have to fight in these wars.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.600]   Yeah, everything will be written by an algorithm.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.280]   Yeah, this will all be solved soon.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.280]   True.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.920]   But I think that's an interesting point though, because the computer is objective.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.680]   So it's true.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.720]   And we have to program the algorithms.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.720]   What's the priority?
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.360]   So we have to give the algorithm a point of view.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.360]   Dang it.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.840]   It's a movie transparent about it.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   Where was I headed?
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.840]   Sorry, I didn't mean to derail you.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.720]   You're bright-barding age that doesn't take age.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.120]   The Trumpists and everybody getting on your case for defending Hillary.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.400]   This is the perspective I got, right?
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   Two things.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.640]   One, I don't hear, I'm an enthusiastic voter for Hillary Clinton.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.720]   I never hear that media, never anywhere.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.080]   It's all that she's the less of two evils, that she's a horrible candidate, that people
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.080]   are enthusiastic.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.280]   It's only because of Trump they're voting for.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.400]   You know, and I went out and I was with people who were enthusiastic and I didn't see that
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   represented.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.400]   That's the one thing.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.400]   Right.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.400]   There's a lot of people who don't get represented.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.440]   You don't see yourself in media.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.000]   If you're an unemployed white person as a Trump voter, you didn't see yourself in media
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.680]   for years and years and years.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.880]   And thus the frustration.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:27.320]   So point one is media does a very bad job, I think, of reflecting the communities that
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.160]   exist and it's reflecting their concerns, whether you're a Trump voter or whether you're
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.120]   African American or whether you're a Hillary voter, whatever.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:39.000]   But the second point goes to the cocker point is that if you listen to cable news, all it
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.880]   is is constant, constant, constant, nattering, let's find today's little scandal, today's
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.200]   little meme, at no point do they say, why are we doing this?
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.880]   When in gawkers life, do they say, we want to report this because because we want to
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.520]   tear down the powerful and show how free we are, what does that actually accomplish?
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.880]   Once you afflict the comfortable, what then?
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.880]   Why do we exist?
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   What are we doing?
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.880]   What are we doing?
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.880]   What we're doing?
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.400]   And that's the problem that I really have that makes me very depressed about my own field.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   And it's challenging though.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.600]   It's not obvious what the right answer is.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:20.400]   It's not like, I think if you watch all the old movies that seem like, oh, that's just
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.520]   a clear path that you just do the right thing and fight.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.040]   It's obvious and it's not obvious.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.040]   It's not easy, I think.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.920]   It's very challenging to figure out what to do, especially in this age where we're
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.760]   unmoored, although the unmooring is probably good.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:42.120]   Well, and so the question that's more relevant to the show, finally, is how does that relate
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.320]   to blogs and social media?
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.400]   And if it stays right, blogs have had an irrevocable impact on mainstream media, on the voice that
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.640]   it has, on the perspective it has.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.240]   The fact that people feel like, listen, when I listen to Morning Joe and I want to scream
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.160]   at the TV, I have no means to do so.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.520]   A lot of other media, I have a means now to talk back.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.720]   I can talk directly to columnists of The New York Times on Twitter and piss them off if
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   I want to.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:09.880]   That's a goal, or praise them, or I know that I have a mechanism to get to them.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.840]   That's new in this world.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.080]   But why do we exist in social media?
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:20.440]   I was thinking a lot this week about what you said last week, Leo, about Twitter.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.360]   And why does Twitter exist?
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.600]   One has to ask at some point.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   Meanwhile Newgate came out.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.160]   I'm like, oh man, okay.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.160]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:42.640]   Well, I should warn you, Stacy, that both Jeff and I have this kind of tendency towards
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.960]   the heavy, what do you, I don't know, pontifical.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.480]   Leo, what's Leo, what's the helium back in?
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.000]   This is not good for Wednesday late afternoon because I'm not drinking.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.240]   As Steve Martin told me, pontificating is fine if you're the pope.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.680]   He said, by the way, that joke takes a little, people don't get that right away.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.760]   It's as sits there for a while.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.240]   Anyway, yes, this is not, this is a show to sit back, enjoy a little mint julep and talk
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.760]   about nougat or new guy.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.880]   I actually have it on my six P because I sign up for the beta.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.440]   You got to get that too.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.880]   You're getting it on my new phone, but you are getting it now, right?
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.880]   That's what that is, isn't it?
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.920]   Oh, it says it's up to date.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.320]   Well, but it's not.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.000]   Well, good news.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.600]   First of all, you did the beta, right?
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.160]   On the other phone, on the fine phone, yes.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.160]   Well, you know exactly.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.160]   Exactly what it does.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.800]   Yes, because normally I go nuts.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.640]   We always just go nuts saying, update, update, check it out.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.640]   I'm not doing that this time.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.640]   I know what no good is.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.080]   You got is and I'll get it.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.080]   That's fine.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.080]   And I'm happy.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   I'm happier.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.520]   I don't look it, but I'm happier.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.520]   You're happier with nougat or just with the fact that I'm not neurotic about wondering
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.280]   if I'm the 10th on my block to get.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   Oh, OK.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   Oh, I will.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.280]   No good.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.080]   Um, have you been playing with it?
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.080]   Stacy?
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.080]   I haven't.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.280]   Um, I am not signed up for the beta program, which is weird because I thought I had been,
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.280]   but you know, that's cool.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.280]   You're kidding.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.280]   It will come when it comes.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.480]   I'm it's not a significant piece.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.680]   It's not like it.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   It's not significant.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.460]   I did notice I think and it's really hard to measure, but I think I noticed better battery
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.080]   life on the six P.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.640]   Which already had those, right?
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.000]   But now they're doing this surprised me.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.160]   Apparently, does didn't apply when the phone was sleeping.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.760]   So now when the screen is off, does applies.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   That kind of shocked me.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.960]   I read that in the notes.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.360]   It could be the way that it was architected.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.360]   Like I know that.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.360]   It's weird.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.080]   With the arm designs, like, well, okay, never mind.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.960]   I'm just not going to try to explain that because my brain is not working.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.520]   Well, in any of these something totally different in any event.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.880]   Uh, I weren't great.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.240]   What are you drinking and why didn't you bring some for me?
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.640]   Topo Chico.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.640]   What's a topo Chico?
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.640]   Really?
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.640]   You don't know.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.640]   Okay.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.640]   You don't know.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.640]   Topo Chico.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.640]   The New York Times did it.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.640]   Yes, it's a trend story.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.440]   It was, but it's like three years too late.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.440]   It's just a mirror.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.440]   I want it.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.440]   I want it.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.240]   It's a mirror from a, like a spring in Mexico.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.640]   And it's like the hipster thing to drink in Austin.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.680]   But it makes his heart sugars love it because it's just outside.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.840]   Is that alcoholic?
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.240]   Well, no.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.240]   Oh, I thought it was.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.960]   But it makes us really well with alcohol.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.840]   Why does it make so well?
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.600]   Um, something about whatever minerals are in there really accentuate like various property
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.160]   is in your alcohol.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.280]   This is from my, my Stobby bartender friends.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.280]   I really can't tell.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.080]   So there's something in there that does make you more drunk, but you have to put you,
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.080]   you add the alcohol.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.080]   It just tastes better.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   It just tastes better.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.120]   It doesn't make you more drunk.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.040]   This is how rumors are formed.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.520]   I've been drinking topo Chico all day.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.840]   Topo Chico.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.560]   It makes you more drunk.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.560]   Is it in every grocery store or is it something you have to do?
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.560]   Oh, no.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   It's in stores.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.880]   It's in gas stations.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.880]   It's all.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.320]   Does it taste better?
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.320]   It does.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.080]   I mean, if you like seltzer water, it's a good seltzer water.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.760]   It's a good seltzer water.
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   I don't know.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.960]   I mean, all right.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.560]   Where do we get there?
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.360]   Oh, no, we were going to do good.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.400]   We were talking about drinking.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.000]   So, no good.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.520]   Um, so the other thing is the double tap for research.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.120]   You've got to be able to get the license to pop to the last thing you did.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.120]   Uh, pinning.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.840]   When did we split screen?
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.840]   Split screen.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   Um, but I...
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.440]   The notifications are much better.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.440]   You can act on some expectations.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.920]   Yeah, I like actually do.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.920]   But see, I've...
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.440]   Part of the reason I've forgotten is because I've had it for so long now.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   Yeah, same here.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.840]   You forgot what's fresh.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.760]   Also, the...
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.760]   The...
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.520]   This screen has more customizability.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   The setting screen, I think, doesn't it?
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520]   Yes.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.440]   Like you can move things around on it?
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.680]   Yeah, big deal.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.680]   But yes.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.680]   Actually, that is...
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   Okay, I was going to say actually that's exciting.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.680]   There are things I want on that screen.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   I'm sorry, that's fine.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.360]   I don't mean that.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.880]   Part of the problem with the fragmentation of Android is, for instance, I've been using
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.240]   the new Nexus 7.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.280]   And it's got all sorts of other things.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.080]   Who knows what's what, right?
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.080]   It's...
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.080]   The new Nexus 7?
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.080]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.080]   Sorry.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   Oh, I've been doing that a lot.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   I was going to be jealous.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.080]   Nexus 7, no.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.080]   Yeah, I know.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.080]   I know.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   Actually, this is an interesting...
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.080]   Let's take a break.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:56.960]   And there is a story I want to talk about, which is that the Note 7, which is a very nice,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:03.500]   beautiful phone, snappy and looks good and everything, is designed in such a way that
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:08.240]   reviewers love it because they don't have to use it for very long.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:16.040]   But that all of Samsung's phones slow down and become crap real a few weeks later.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.520]   Well, well, let's talk about it.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   Is that the case?
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.520]   I'll tell you a few.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.520]   I hope not.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.520]   My mom and dad just bought one.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.160]   Yeah, I really like the Note.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:31.880]   I'm a big Note fan, but...
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.200]   First though, let's talk about ZipperKruder.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.840]   Because if you're the person hiring in your business, you're doing the most important
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:43.640]   thing that you can do in your business, which is building the business brick by brick, person
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.040]   by person.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.400]   I could say this with authority now, that I've been running a business of my very own
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.400]   for 10 years.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.760]   It's a small business.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.560]   And certainly, the smaller the business, the more important it is because each and every
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.520]   person can make or break your business a great employee, can build it, can make your
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.320]   business sing a bad employee, can bring it down.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.600]   You want to find the right person.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.360]   And the right person is out there.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.560]   The trick is finding the right person.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:13.560]   And that means you have to get to where that person, whoever he or she is, where they are.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.560]   And that can be the challenge.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.320]   You posted on one job board.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.240]   There's no guarantee you're hitting that person.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:25.760]   But with ZipperKruder, you're hitting so many more people, 100+ job boards, with one
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.000]   click of the mouse on ZipperKruder.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.360]   Plus social networks like Craigslist and Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.200]   And you're also, because ZipperKruder also is the place people go to get hired, you're
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.600]   immediately matching against 6 million current resumes.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.480]   So the chance of you hitting the exact person you want is much higher.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.600]   And then the beauty is, you don't mind getting all these candidates because they all come
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.000]   into the ZipperKruder interface.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.040]   They don't go into your inbox or call you at your office or at home.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.840]   They go into the ZipperKruder interface.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.200]   You can design questions there, you know, multiple choice or essays or you can do, you
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.760]   can rank the people, you can screen out what people that just aren't good, that won't
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.680]   fit, you can find the right person fast and you'll have applicants within a day just because
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.360]   of the speed of how ZipperKruder works.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.040]   You'll also have applicants who are a mobile only because they have a great mobile application
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.320]   process.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:26.160]   That number on the page over 800,000 businesses is now a million companies have used ZipperKruder.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.440]   Many hundreds of the top Fortune 500 companies use ZipperKruder.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:36.720]   It is now known to be the tool for hiring.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.960]   You'll find candidates in any city, any industry nationwide and I want you to try it for free
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.400]   at zipperkruder.com/tweig.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:50.040]   We've been using it and we love it and you really want to try it.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:27:02.200]   ZipperKruder.com/tweig.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:13.680]   The Empire, the Empire, the Empire, the Rock Opera, the Topo GGO of tech.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.480]   Do you think it's the bubbles?
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.000]   Because they've always said champagne gets you drunk faster because of the bubbles.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.800]   Oh, I think there is something on that, but I've never actually researched it.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   It speeds absorption.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.920]   Okay, we're going to do a test.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   Yes.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.040]   Do you have champagne?
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:38.280]   Stacey drunk this level and next week, you'd be fun drunk.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.320]   I'm thinking you dance.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.160]   You're a dancer.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.800]   I would say you'd get even more honest.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.320]   Oh, dear.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   That would be bad.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.320]   That is a problem.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.680]   So, I don't know.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.920]   You probably don't have an over the shoulder shot yet on this set.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.520]   You did Sunday.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.120]   Oh, yeah, we do.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.320]   Look at that.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.520]   So this is the Galaxy Note.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.640]   I've had it for a week.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   Look here.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.640]   Already.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   Oh.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.280]   And it finds scratches.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.000]   Those are scratches at the bottom.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   I haven't dropped it.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.480]   Or rubber back when iPhones were scratched.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.480]   We all would have fits.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.440]   Well, this is like a glassy finish back.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:21.320]   And when the Galaxy S7 came out, which is basically the same as this phone, people
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.480]   had all sorts of scores on the glass, even though it's Gorilla Glass 5.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.960]   This is a very fragile phone.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.800]   Thank God today the case came.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.920]   But it was even as new as this phone is.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.920]   It's already too late for this.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:39.320]   And this is kind of in a physical world, a manifestation of what the folks at XDA developers
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   are saying.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.120]   That's the great forum for Android fans everywhere.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:50.200]   They're saying the press never gets it right on Samsung phones because they always start
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.600]   out really fast and slick.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.480]   But in the real world over time, performance sucks.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.520]   Now I have to say, I'm the press, right?
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.280]   I have a new phone every few months.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.240]   I probably don't use these phones long enough to experience the slowdown if there is such
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   a thing.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:15.000]   Although I did on my S6 a couple of generations ago, so you're significant hesitation and
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   slowdown, not so much on this one.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   I'm kind of a fan of this phone.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.920]   This has the, according to display, made the best screen on any phone on the market.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:28.960]   It's a beautiful OLED screen, something Apple still isn't doing.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.400]   Of course, the stylus.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.560]   Everybody loves the stylus.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.640]   Or if you do love the stylus, this is the phone for stylus lovers.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.080]   You can write.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.800]   You can actually translate handwriting.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.040]   You can draw pictures.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:51.480]   Renee Richie, who is from iMore and clearly Apple, lover, loves his iPhone and his iPad,
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.520]   was said every big function of a stylus.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.520]   He loved, he was drummed.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.360]   I wish I had one.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.080]   I never use it.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.080]   No.
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.160]   I don't use Google now enough.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.560]   My handwriting is so terrible and I'm not.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.520]   Oh, oh, nice.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.320]   But yeah, I mean, you can take screenshots and add it.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.120]   There's a lot of, and by the way, this is one of the reasons that I'm, I don't know
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.040]   if Nougat is such a big deal for me there.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.880]   They have had Samsung ads, all sorts of stuff, right?
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.960]   It's full of stuff that isn't in Android.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.600]   Like one of the things I really love that's been in most of the Galaxy phones for some
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.640]   time, your parents might like this.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.200]   Stacey, is the adapt sound where you actually take a hearing test.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   You put in your headphones.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:37.000]   You take a hearing test and they generate an equalization curve that will make stuff
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   sound better.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.080]   And it makes a huge difference for me.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.320]   No, I have to tell them about that.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.680]   Is it like an automatic thing?
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.240]   Yeah, well, it's buried.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.240]   No.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   Oh, that's the problem.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   Okay.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.560]   In fact, I read a review of the S7 that said it's a shame Samsung doesn't do that anymore,
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.560]   but they did.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.560]   They just, I guess didn't fight.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.040]   You go to sounds in the settings and you have to scroll all the way down to sound quality
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.600]   and effects.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.400]   And there's an equalizer, but at the bottom of that, there's adapt sound.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.120]   And what it does, this is my curve that it generated.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.680]   There's the light blue below.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:12.480]   You can see as with most old folks, my high end is really poor.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.280]   And the darker blue is what it equalizes it up to to give me excellent hearing across
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.280]   the board.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.280]   And it's definitely noticeable.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.120]   I mean, it really sounds much better to me.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.840]   That is so awesome.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.520]   Yeah, but that's not nougat.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.760]   It also does things that like it was the first to do split screen.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.760]   Now nougat does it, but I've been doing that for a while on my Samsung phones.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:37.520]   So on the other hand, you know, a lot of people say, and I don't disagree, they junk it up
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.520]   with other things.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.520]   Right?
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.520]   There's all sorts of weird.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.520]   Croft.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.080]   You know, the other day, my Chromebook at work, you know, finally got slowed down.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.080]   I actually thought a tweet deck is freezing on me constantly.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.240]   So I thought maybe it was the Chromebook.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:55.120]   So I rebuilt the Chromebook and it takes literally two minutes.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.400]   Why can't that be the case for a phone?
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   I know.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   Well, it is.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.680]   That's actually if you're going to take one thing that's great about nougat when you update
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:10.240]   Android now, instead of going through each application, one by one is app one of 293.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.240]   Mm hmm.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.240]   App two of 293.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.840]   You might as well just go to bed.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.640]   In fact, many Android phones have a setting.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:21.160]   It's not default in Android, but many Android aftermarket settings say check for updates
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.240]   in the middle of the night and apply them in the middle of the night.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.640]   So I don't have to look at it in the morning.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.000]   Nougat doesn't do that anymore.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.800]   It's almost it is almost as fast as that.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.520]   It's almost two minutes is very quick.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.520]   Okay.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.520]   That's good.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:39.800]   So part of the problem is this note seven is of course Marshmallow because it came out
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.920]   what like one week before nougat came out.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.840]   And because it has so many adaptations, it's going to be a while.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.960]   Sam sucks, says, no, no, we're going to get it out in two months.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.960]   We'll see.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.960]   I'll see it.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.960]   I'll just believe it when I see it.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.440]   But it takes them a while to adapt it because they have to take the Android new Android
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.760]   source code and then add all their do hickeys and stuff.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.820]   So if I tell you what, if I get a better camera and better battery life on a Nexus, I would
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.560]   choose the Nexus.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:16.400]   I wish they if I could get a pure Android experience on that hardware.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.800]   Well, that's the I mentioned that before, right?
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   Right.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.160]   So you used to have, you remember that was a brief period around Google play experience
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.160]   for one phone.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.160]   They sold it and it was great.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.160]   Oh, I thought it was more than one.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.960]   I thought they did a couple.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   Well, but it's gone.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.160]   Anyway, I like the Nexus 7.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.960]   I agree that sometimes Samsung phones deteriorate over time, but.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.960]   Note seven.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.960]   Oh, it's seven.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.960]   Sorry.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.960]   Again.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.960]   That's okay.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   Note.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   Nexus.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.800]   Note seven.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.760]   Part of the confusion is the last one was note five.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.860]   So I don't.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.160]   And there was a Nexus seven.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.160]   There was.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.160]   Yes.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.160]   Which I miss terribly.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   You know what?
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.160]   Or the Nexus seven.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.160]   Still carry it.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.160]   Didn't they just cut?
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.160]   Did they cut off support for that?
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   Finally?
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.160]   Was that the news or was that?
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.160]   Yeah, I have one.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.160]   It's up to the eight through six.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   Oh, one.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   I don't know if it'll go to seven.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.160]   I have the second year.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   Nexus seven.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:19.160]   Oh, no new get support for next 2013.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:22.160]   Nexus seven, which I think is the second one.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.160]   Oh, oh, and a tablet really can use that.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.160]   Screen and stuff.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.160]   That's a shame.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.800]   The Nexus seven to me was the perfect size.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   It was a great tablet.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.200]   I absolutely loved it.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:39.080]   But when I like my Pixel C, but it's just, it's just very different.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.080]   It's much bigger.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.200]   You will get new get on the Pixel C too soon.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.160]   Did darn well better.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.160]   You're so cranky, Jeff.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   I know.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.160]   He's like, it's great.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.360]   We just count on Jeff to be peeved.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.360]   Miffed.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.360]   You know why?
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.360]   Nobody's miffed with me.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.920]   So I'm really going to be miffed back.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.800]   He was a TV reviewer for years.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.440]   That'll turn your salary.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.560]   I have hate mail from Bill Cosby.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.840]   Just now, something to be proud of.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.880]   Let's see.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.000]   I dropped a study in just because I thought it was interesting.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.920]   This is apropos of nothing.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.600]   But it was, I'll find it.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:27.720]   It's on how typing or actually voice input is three times faster than typing on your little
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.720]   tiny phones.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.720]   It's a surprise.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.920]   It took Stanford study to figure that out, huh?
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.240]   Well, exactly.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.000]   I'm like, but they also included as part of that.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.320]   It looks like some of the challenges that you have when you do voice recognition when,
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.480]   you know, you're like having to go back and fix things.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.480]   So I was like, oh.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.120]   You need to fool yourself on the street.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.880]   Here's something surprising from that study though.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:57.480]   Speech recognition is three times faster than English typing, but only 2.8 times faster
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.480]   than Chinese typing.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.080]   You'd think it'd be the other way around.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   Also, because they can do a paragraph and a character.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   Oh, you're right.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   Each character is one word.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.080]   You're right.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.080]   Of course.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.080]   That's not.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.040]   Is that how like the, it's pinion keyboards?
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.040]   Is that how you say it?
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.040]   There's a.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.040]   There's a.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.040]   There's a.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.040]   There's a.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.040]   Pinion, but I don't know how they do keyboards.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040]   I don't know how they do it either.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.040]   Pinion is the Anglicization of Chinese photographs.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.040]   I don't know how they do.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.040]   Maybe they do pinion.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.040]   I don't know what they do.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.040]   Well, let's Google how do you type in Chinese?
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   My.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.960]   In the physical keyboards, I don't know how they do it on a phone, a physical keyboards,
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.440]   you'd have series of shift keys that would add that you so you slowly build the character
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.440]   up.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.720]   Well, it was pinion still.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.320]   Is it pinion?
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   To enable.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.880]   English error rate is 20% lower.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:51.200]   Mandarin error rate is 63% lower when you speak, which is interesting.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.960]   And this was not using Google's speech recognition, but Baidu's deep speech too.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.720]   So and it was it was let's see.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.160]   It was on iOS keyboards.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:06.840]   It was built in 40 or pinion pinion Apple iOS keyboard.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:12.680]   The iOS keyboard is horrible.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.200]   That I'm so inaccurate on that because it's small.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.880]   It only recently had lower case keys to you know, you had to guess what the shift state
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   was.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   Hmm.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.240]   So you want to see?
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   I don't know.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   I just want your video.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.240]   They did a video.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.240]   I was looking for one.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.240]   I love the course they did.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.240]   Of course they did.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.240]   Samford's got this great open.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.240]   They have to make videos.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.640]   Cause it's like the old HBO.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.680]   So great speech recognition, but it really hasn't worked well enough in terms of error
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   rate.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.680]   They have budget.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.680]   Look at this applications.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.560]   This is a 60 minutes quality production here.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.320]   That's only speech recognition was working really well.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.920]   Two camera shoot to the deep learning and big data.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.920]   They got some wardrobe.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.920]   No, no, no.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.800]   So we ran a study makeup where people had the.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.000]   They have very nice lenses.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.400]   Over a hundred phrases using both speech recognition and.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.360]   I really wish they would shift back and forth.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.000]   And we were throwing this stuff up to the regular.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.400]   It was out there today and we were able to see which one was faster.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.920]   You know why they why people do that by the way?
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.480]   Cause people who do TV think you're an idiot.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   Yes.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.480]   Amen Leo.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   Amen.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.480]   You know what I really hate?
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.000]   I hate when they do the two shots and one of them you're looking like this.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   You're looking at nothing.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.560]   Yeah, it just makes no sense at all.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.560]   Or looking that way.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.560]   Because TV people.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.680]   That's why I like this show because I can actually talk to the user.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.280]   I don't want them even.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.440]   But instead on TV, I'm always looking that way.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:40.560]   People on TV just think the viewers are the most short, short attention span.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.560]   Nudnicks.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.560]   Yes, they are.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.960]   And we got to keep switching it.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   You will be so bored.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.440]   Which side do you want to do it the wrong way?
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.160]   Yeah, no, I have to look like this.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.240]   They actually make you do that.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.840]   The reporter as you know, says to the right of the camera.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.640]   Yeah, it says talk to me.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.840]   And in fact, and then they edited like I'm not really like that guy's never in it.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.640]   So why don't I just talk to the people?
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.960]   But no, I end up over here talking to some imaginary person because I'm an idiot.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.880]   I don't know where the camera lens is.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.880]   And then people.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.640]   Well, the people talk directly to the camera.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.960]   Sometimes they look like serial killers.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:15.240]   Like if you're on TV, they're like that really like when I do this a lot because I get really
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.000]   excited about things and you're like intense and you're looking at them and they're like,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   whoa.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.240]   If you if you approach me at an angle, I'm a little less scary.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.440]   Oh, that's makes sense.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.680]   That's I mean, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.120]   Would you ever work in television?
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.520]   No, no, why would I work in TV?
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.520]   Because it's only the best medium ever invented.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.320]   Like writing is the best medium ever invented.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   Send podcasting.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   Yeah, Gutenberg.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.160]   I'm sure that's true.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   Oh, drink.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.160]   Gutenberg.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.760]   Is that what this is?
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.000]   It's a breaking game.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Drinking.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Okay.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Anytime you mention.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   All right.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.800]   That's a good study and it's that's a surprise.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:05.840]   I'm so much better dictating than I am typing on a little dinky keyboard.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.400]   I always dictate.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.680]   I've seen a lot more people talking to their phones lately.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.520]   We I think we talked about this this.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.520]   Can you have it?
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.080]   I was in where was I?
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:22.040]   I was in the Admiral's Club at some airport.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.480]   One of the airports I was in, I think it was San Francisco.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:29.680]   And this dude was just like talking to do text.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.440]   And it was so funny watching him because it was like Jack Rabbit quick, you know, like.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.440]   Talk to us.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.440]   Talk to us.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.680]   You mean he was multitasking at the same time as on a phone call, he was sending texts.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.840]   No, no, he was.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:46.560]   I think he was send like dictating his texts, but it was yeah, because he was just such
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.080]   a public place and there was a lot of noise around.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:54.480]   Yeah, I'll do that though, because I'm so much better at speaking than typing.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.560]   And but the problem is you do for a living.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.680]   Well, it's just it's just easier.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.480]   The problem is you always have to correct it.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.560]   There's always sometimes spent going.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:08.760]   No, I didn't mean conveyor belt.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:14.280]   That's another thing I learned from my time with the movie star Steve Martin.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.440]   Can I have a drop that in lately?
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.440]   Please do.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.760]   He told me he sent me a text.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.800]   He sent me a text that said, we'll have to be late later for lunch because I have a
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   nook rehearsal.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:30.280]   I said, Oh, that's probably a movie term, a nook rehearsal.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.440]   So I asked him what's a nook rehearsal.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.680]   I said, I don't know.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:36.080]   He said, he said, that's what all the young comics do now.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.200]   They don't correct their auto correct.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   They leave it as is.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.080]   That's the thing, the in thing to do now.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.000]   It's kind of, you know, that ironic, just leave it as is.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Right.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Even if it's modern texting.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Yeah, modern texting.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.360]   Don't fix it.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.920]   So just so you know, when you get weird text from me, that's what's going on.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.280]   I'm going to be trending.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:05.400]   Yes, Steve Martin, Tom Hanks and a third star who's doing I forget when they're going
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.200]   to have a gross out moment, but they're going to have colonoscopies.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.720]   Yeah, they get together.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.680]   They do the schedule with the same time and they get together and they do the prep together.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.680]   What?
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.240]   That's what this is.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.240]   Starvation prep.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.440]   No, the last three year system prep.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.400]   Oh, I would they do it together.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.680]   That's something you want to show thought is what that's how embarrassing, but they
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.360]   thought they must all have a little kind of private rooms.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:34.000]   They play cards and then, Oh, sorry.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   There we go.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Colonoscopy parties.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Martin Short.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.800]   That's Martin Short is making that up.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.600]   I guarantee you that is not true.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.400]   Howard Stern knows Steve Martin.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.120]   Well, that's a joke.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.120]   All right.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.120]   I'll ask Steve.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.120]   Do ask Steve.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.120]   I don't know him as well as Howard.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.120]   What if he invites you Leo?
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.880]   What if he's like, Oh, yeah, you want to come?
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.280]   Then you got a decision to make.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.280]   Okay.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.000]   That is a very interesting question.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:06.760]   If you could hang out with Martin Short, Steve, Martin and Tom Hanks, but you had to have
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.320]   a colonoscopy.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.120]   Would you do it?
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.120]   Sure.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.120]   Because you're transparent.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   I would do it.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.120]   I'd do it.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.560]   I don't want to be on the show.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.600]   Better than a topo Chica.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.400]   All right.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.400]   Stacy's opaque.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:29.200]   I try to be as opaque as possible.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.080]   For reasons.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.240]   I don't want to share that with anybody.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.880]   That's a private moment.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.780]   Well, it certainly is the misery.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.240]   Have you played with duo yet?
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.240]   Oh, yes.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.040]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.040]   So exciting.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.040]   I got my mom to.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.040]   You want to duo me?
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   You got your mom to duo.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.160]   Yeah, she duo'd with me and my it was my daughter's birthday.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:56.080]   So we all duo'd and it's awesome because I could never get my mom on.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.800]   I mean, she's she's a smart lady.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.800]   She actually has more tablets than I don't know what her deal is.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:06.720]   Anyway, she loves technology, but she hates glitchy apps.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.200]   So her life really is socky.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.320]   But duo worked for her.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.320]   She downloaded it.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.000]   So we finally are actually able to communicate via video calls, which is so fun.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Oh, you couldn't before.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.280]   So she wasn't using Skype or FaceTime or some other.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.440]   She has a Skype account.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.120]   But if you wanted to Skype with her, you had to call her.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:27.040]   You had to arrange the time because she had to sit up and it was.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.040]   Well, that's true.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.680]   That is one thing that's better than Skype is you don't have to have it running to get
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.680]   a call.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.680]   Oh, right.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.680]   That's good.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.280]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.080]   FaceTime you do not either, but FaceTime's iOS only, right?
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.080]   Or Apple only.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.080]   Right.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.080]   And this is great.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:47.160]   I made my husband who's got an iPhone download it for his thing.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.400]   So we could finally have video chat and he's like, yeah, we're not going to do that.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.400]   Hey, some people.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.400]   Some people don't.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.240]   Is your husband in technology?
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:59.480]   No, he's a, he's a, well, sort of, he's a domain name blogger.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   So yes, maybe.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   What?
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.360]   What's a domain name blogger?
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.360]   That's okay.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360]   Sorry.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.200]   He does a domain name wire.com or D&W.com.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.560]   He's like the number one or number two blogger in the domain industry.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   Wow.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.760]   Is that how you met?
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.520]   No, we met as, we met as our A's and dorms.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.680]   I'm like a child bride.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.680]   We got married really.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.080]   Oh, that's the in college.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.080]   Not in college.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.200]   We're not after college, but right after college.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.200]   Don't know me.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.720]   I didn't even know there was a job category.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.520]   See, I get mad because I go through, you know, they say, what's your occupation and
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.800]   they never have media.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.680]   They always have to pick like businessman.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.680]   They have media.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.400]   A lot of times they know.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.400]   Oh, no.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.400]   What was the bill?
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.480]   But boy, if you're a domain name blogger, what the hell's your job?
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.480]   Entrepreneur.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   Entrepreneur.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:58.120]   Well, so the reason I was asking was, are you two gadget freaks in one house or are you
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.120]   the gadget?
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.120]   No, no, no.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.720]   He comes on the podcast sometimes.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:07.560]   I use him as my voice from the real world because he comes in and he's like, and if
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.040]   you, he's not the real world.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:15.040]   If he's a domain name blogger, he's, he's, he's pretty normal other than that.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.080]   And you know, he's lived the horror stories.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.160]   Stacy's trying out another darn doorbell.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.160]   Can I just have a doorbell?
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.320]   You hit and it goes and it makes a sound like a ding dong?
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.680]   No, we've got to have fancy doorbells.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.560]   Oh, that must be hell for him, huh?
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.600]   There's always a dude too, Hickey.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.560]   So like I was trying the sunrise feature on like some Phillips Hue light bulbs, I think
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.960]   it was in our bedroom.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:42.440]   And for some reason, I don't, they didn't tell you this, but you have to set, like I
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.720]   set the schedule, but I didn't set my time zone.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.720]   So it thought I lived in the middle of the Atlantic.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.520]   So around four in the morning, it was sunrise.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.040]   We're both like, what the hell's going on?
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.040]   Stacy.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.040]   Okay.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.120]   I got a similar story.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.120]   I had Hue lights.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.440]   Mainly the bottom line of both these stories is do not have Hue lights in your bedroom.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.520]   I have Hue lights in my bedroom, right?
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:09.320]   Same idea, you know, slowly ramp you up in the morning sunset at night.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.800]   What they don't tell you, and that makes sense is that when the power goes out and then
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:19.000]   comes back on, they come on full bright like, bam, middle of the night.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.720]   I'm like, Lisa and I are in bed and bam, the lights go on, but this is exactly the difference
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.480]   you mean Lisa.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.880]   I get my phone out and try to launch the Hue app.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.960]   She just goes over to the wall and turns the lights off and goes back to sleep.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:38.040]   Yeah, if you're going to have, if you're going to have smart bulbs, I would recommend
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.040]   putting in a smart switch.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.520]   Because if you have the smart switch, or just don't put them in your bedroom, also totally
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.520]   legit.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:48.640]   I understand why they come on full bright because you want them, right?
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.720]   But it is not a nice way to wake up.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.040]   You don't know what it's terrible for AM.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.360]   You're not in Kira body.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.440]   Come on.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.440]   You know what's first?
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:02.520]   The worst way to wake up is having all of your sonos is decide that because you're home,
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:07.680]   it's time to run the welcome home sequence, not just in your bedroom, but around your
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.240]   entire house.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.480]   What's the welcome home sequence?
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.080]   I don't have a welcome home sequence.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:20.080]   So I was playing this was an early iteration of an app and it no longer has it.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:25.400]   It works now, but when it had geolocation and it wasn't as fine tuned.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:31.280]   So what was happening is it kept my phone would be in and out of like range.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.760]   So it kept thinking I was leaving the house and coming back in.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.840]   So it did that in the middle of the night and I had set it up.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.120]   So welcome home.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:46.920]   Some of my lights came on and then the sonos would play like welcome Stacey.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.880]   Oh my God, you're such a geek.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.080]   Did you record that?
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:56.920]   No, I mean, I could, but I didn't record the mess up because it was the middle of the
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.920]   night.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.920]   How did everybody say welcome?
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.480]   What song should you play for welcome home?
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.480]   Welcome home.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.480]   What do you think?
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.920]   Your dreams where you're ticket out.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.400]   It's an automated voice.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.520]   Welcome home Stacey.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.720]   I am the robot that has taken over your house.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:18.440]   Please enter and close the door behind you.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.160]   Oh, no, the app does that for you.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.640]   That's even scarier.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.760]   So you come in the door and it goes, Pam.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.080]   No, it doesn't.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.080]   It doesn't.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:32.320]   There are no windows and no doors.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:38.200]   So I have a similar thing with my sonos.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:43.080]   Often this is a bad habit when we're leaving for the day, I'll be listening and then I'll
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.600]   do the mute button on the sonos and that mutes it, right?
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.360]   But there's a problem because our cats like to sleep on the sonos.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:56.200]   So in the middle of the night, because I often have the sonos connected all through the house,
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:01.840]   the cat will lie on the sonos, turn off the mute button and the blaring music in the middle
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.840]   of the night.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.840]   Yes.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:09.480]   So what we're saying is smart houses are pretty dumb.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.480]   Yes.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.480]   Agreed.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.040]   But there's so much fun.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.920]   This is what it means to be a pioneer.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.920]   That and living with a domain name blogger.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.840]   He likes the echo though.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.440]   Well, that's how I knew it was a real device for people.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.680]   Yeah, no, yeah, you know what?
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.880]   The echo is an interesting thing because you wouldn't think so, but then you just love
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:31.880]   it.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:36.800]   So you think duo is going to be a hit then because it wasn't, I think the jury was out initially
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.360]   like, is this what is the mocking of it?
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.360]   I actually, do you all remember Tango?
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.520]   Is that even still a thing?
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.520]   Yeah, Project Tango.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.160]   No, no, no, no, not Google's Project Tango.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.160]   Sorry.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.160]   It was an app.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.160]   It was a video calling app.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.160]   Let's go around.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.160]   Okay.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.160]   So like I use that and still my family use that.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.160]   Tango, Viber.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.040]   There were a whole category of that.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:04.800]   And then what's app and Facebook and all these other added video calling.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.480]   So now there's 800 ways to do video calls.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.480]   Go ahead.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.640]   No, no, I was just saying that I think this is probably a really solid entry.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.640]   It's so easy.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.640]   It's so much easier.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.640]   It is.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.640]   Right.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.400]   And I love, I love the, I mean, I like the setup.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.440]   I like that I could call my mom right now.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.120]   She would kill me, but.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.000]   Yeah, but she's a big button there.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.560]   Oh, no, but that's the beauty of it.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.560]   She's a big.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.560]   So get this.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.560]   I've replaced.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.720]   So maybe there is something there.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   I thought it was just me.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:36.520]   I've replaced the phone icon on my phone with a duo icon.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.520]   A lot.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.080]   How about that?
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.480]   Because you call a lot show up right there.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.480]   It's very easy.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:45.040]   Is it going to come with new good automatically?
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.040]   No.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.520]   Why wouldn't they do that?
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.520]   Nor will I'll.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.280]   Oh, that's four.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   Just ask.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   Well, who knows what Google's up to?
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:56.560]   What's going on with Hangouts for crying?
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:00.240]   But I wasn't sure that this would take because I remember spaces.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.720]   That was here and gone.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.560]   Google's done this a lot.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:09.240]   And I wasn't sure that this would become popular, but I think it might be one of the
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:14.600]   case where tech journalists kind of gloss it over because we know there's 800 other ways
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.840]   to do this.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.760]   But real people go, that's nice and easy.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.080]   I don't think I'll use that.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:26.040]   You know, someone was asking in the chat room about 911, dialing 911 on something like
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.560]   that if you don't have the phone icon.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:28.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.240]   You still have your emergency thing, right?
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.920]   I mean, I have a phone icon and a folder somewhere.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.600]   I could still dial it.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.600]   I want.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:40.840]   So the other day I was I was choking and like not total choking, not full on Heimlich
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:47.280]   yet, but I was also trying to tell the echo to stop a timer.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.000]   And so I was like Alexa.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   Wow.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.520]   I was like, how awesome would it be?
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:57.240]   She's already listening to me if she could like, do you want me to dial 911?
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:01.520]   And if I didn't respond, you know, boom, that happened.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.280]   So I was starting to think about things like in a connected house, how you could call emergency
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.280]   services.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.280]   So that person.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.480]   Well, iPhone will do that.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.000]   Well, if it is a jokey.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.200]   I was 10.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.120]   And the Apple the Apple Watch has an emergency button.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.720]   I'm trying to remember the details of it.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.360]   But yeah, I think there's something like that on the Apple Watch with iOS 10.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:29.120]   And then the reason I don't need a phone icon also is because I could say, okay, Google
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.960]   call, you know who.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:35.840]   So most of the time if I don't make calls very often, that's that's part of the way
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:40.120]   that that's there is Alex Wilhelm was here on Twitter a couple of weeks ago.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.120]   And he said, I don't have a phone.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.120]   What do you need a phone icon for?
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.680]   I don't ever use this for phone calls.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.680]   He's a young person.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.680]   And I thought you're right.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.680]   It's not videos.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.680]   But that's true.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.520]   I rarely make outbound phone calls.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.120]   But when I do, I can easily go.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.120]   Okay.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.120]   You call your kids?
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.120]   But so, okay.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:59.440]   So there they the people I call, I have a little dedicated contact button here so I
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.640]   can call them or text them rapidly.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:04.040]   Do they ever answer?
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.040]   No.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:09.080]   Actually, it's gone the other way.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:12.200]   So Henry, no signer.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   You know, he's 21.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.200]   I don't hear from him.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.200]   I can't I text him.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.520]   I call him nothing.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.520]   Next we ever can do.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.520]   We'll call him.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.600]   You know, and he'll go, hey, I don't want to talk right now, but call me back later.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.600]   I'm busy.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.280]   I'm with my friends, whatever.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.600]   Never.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:32.160]   But my daughter is 24 now has taken a calling me a lot like every day.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.920]   And now it's like, don't tell her this.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:41.440]   But it's like, I love my daughter, but nobody likes to talk on the phone all the time.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.080]   I don't want to talk on the phone.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.440]   Is she driving when she does it?
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.320]   No, she used to until she had many accidents.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.920]   Now she no longer has a car.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.520]   So she's in Mexico, actually, for the semester.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.920]   So she's back.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.480]   Oh, yeah, she's in Puebla.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.480]   She stayed.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.600]   She went down there in January and she stayed and she's going to stay there through December.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.080]   And she may she says, I like it so much.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.040]   I might stay for another semester.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.040]   Wow.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.040]   Yeah, she loves it.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.040]   She's having a great time.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.480]   Spanish is amazing, though.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:16.160]   Yeah, she was floating in France because she went to high school in France for a year.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.640]   She's very international.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.320]   And she's, yeah, she's fluent in Spanish.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.120]   She went to Spanish language school during the summer to polish up her grammar because
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.720]   her spoken is very good, but her grammar.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.840]   And now she's in school.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.200]   It's all it's a it's a Mexican school.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.800]   She's studying public health.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.400]   She wants to do public health.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.880]   Oh, she can finish this excellent.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:36.880]   Yes, exactly.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.800]   She wants to do public health either in Spanish.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.760]   She actually was studying Arabic as well.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.320]   She was thinking what she really wanted to do.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.160]   I know the brave things she wanted to do.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:55.160]   And daddy did not want to do was outreach to women in the Middle East in Arabic because,
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:00.160]   of course, as you might imagine, public health information for women hard as it is.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.040]   It's almost as bad as Texas.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.440]   Not quite.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:06.160]   Did you see that's that?
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.200]   About maternal death.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:13.960]   Maternal mortality in Texas is it's the worst in the developed world.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.240]   It's doubled in the last.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.600]   I don't remember how many years.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.200]   I hope that's just a blip and not an actual trend.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.840]   Could be just a statistical anomaly, right?
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:31.480]   We have 500, 500,000 people living on the border without access to clean water and like
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.400]   basic neighborhood services.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:39.600]   If you think about everybody who doesn't have basic access to maternal health care, living
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:42.040]   they're not going to do well.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.280]   They're terrible as a state.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.480]   Anyway, we're bad.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.160]   And that's one of the reasons Abby is studying Spanish and wants to do public health, particularly
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.460]   for women.
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.160]   And it could very well be on the Rio Grande.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.960]   There you go.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.960]   She can talk to my daughter who also is fluent in Spanish.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.920]   She goes to a bilingual school, right?
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   She does.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.200]   See, I encourage both my kids to really be citizens, global citizens, because I feel like
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:10.840]   that's the future for their generation.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.840]   It's going to be.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:12.840]   I hope.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:13.840]   I mean, it could go.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:14.840]   Unless you get like a paddle.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:15.840]   It could go the other way.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:16.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.840]   Right.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.400]   You're either building a wall or we're going to be global.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.400]   How about Aloe?
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.120]   We don't know when Aloe will come out.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.120]   Duo is part of a duo.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:26.840]   Aloe is the second half of the duo.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:32.760]   It's a chat application that will also be, I believe, cross-platform.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.600]   Do they say it with cross-platform?
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   I think so.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.600]   I think they did.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.600]   Yes.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.520]   They stand in direct opposition to...
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.840]   But the weakness to both is that you've got to get people to download it.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:46.840]   Right.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.600]   I mentioned this earlier.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.720]   This bugs the hell out of me.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.440]   It's retrograde.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:58.280]   When chatting first started, or even email for that matter, you had to be on the same
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.720]   system as the person you were chatting with or email.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.000]   Email eventually got federated.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.560]   So one email address.
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:09.000]   If it was an MCI mail or genie or CompuServe could email other email addresses that made
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.440]   email take off, that made email useful.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.440]   Chat was the same way.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:19.040]   It was ICQ or MSN or Yahoo! chat and you couldn't talk, interoperate.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.640]   Then times went by and XMPP came along.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.040]   Google was a big proponent.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.480]   We could all talk to one another.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.880]   Now we're going backwards again, wherever it says, "No, no, it's bad for business.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.880]   We want to silo.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.280]   You can only talk to people using our app."
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:33.280]   It's terrible.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.800]   That's just tech.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.440]   We silo, then we come together.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.040]   Then we silo, and then we come together.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.240]   Oh, it's a cycle, you think?
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.240]   Oh, it totally is.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:48.400]   I mean, not just in chat and apps, but think about things like even enterprise tech and
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:55.840]   like how we built all these separate siloed things for, I don't know, ERP and HR and all
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:56.840]   this.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.120]   And then now what they're like, "Oh, let's bring it all to the cloud and link everything
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.120]   via APIs."
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:03.800]   I mean, it's just like, "Hey, there's money here.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:04.800]   Let's build something.
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.520]   We don't want it to work with anyone."
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:13.040]   Google's aloe, I think one of the most interesting features, there are many.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:18.360]   And by the way, I'm just hoping this is Google's final bid for check because they can't even
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:21.480]   make up their mind what the hell they want for messaging.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:24.760]   But they will also have an assistant built in and you can talk to the assistant.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.840]   See, I wonder whether that isn't the primary use of aloe.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.640]   That's what I think too.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.640]   It's going to be great.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:37.040]   It's great for users, but it's also going to be great to train the...
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.040]   Think about it.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.040]   Google does...
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.540]   They've got this...
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:45.440]   When I search something on Google, even when I'm doing it via voice, it's much less
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.000]   natural language, right?
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.320]   But now you're going to get all of these very natural language requests written into the
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.800]   text with people.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:56.600]   And that's going to be wonderful for their machine learning efforts.
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:01.920]   And Google on tap will work better because you can search the text on the screen.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.240]   I'm super excited about it.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.240]   Me too.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.240]   I want to use it.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:08.520]   I want a good centralized messaging platform that I can use with everybody.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.440]   I'm using Facebook Messenger right now.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.240]   That's really not great.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.240]   Nobody...
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:18.680]   What's the rumor on when Google Assistant...
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.160]   Google Home is going to be out.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.160]   Any rumors?
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.160]   There are no...
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:27.280]   I have heard that it is being tested, but that's all I've heard.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.160]   So I have to deal with that.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.520]   It starts to all come together.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.480]   It's like the Matrix.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.480]   Except not the Matrix.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.600]   Isn't it funny how I want to buy into this?
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.600]   I want to go all in.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:41.600]   I want to Google.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600]   Of course you do.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.440]   I want it all integrated.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.880]   Google for all that it makes you into the product, they deliver amazing services.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.080]   I'll give them my data, sure.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:04.200]   Well, will you give McDonald's Happy Meal fitness tracker your data?
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.960]   Be a bad idea because they just got recalled.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.520]   Did they make them...
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.520]   Are they made them with the nickel?
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.000]   5% of the population are allergic with.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.760]   Reports of burns and rashes trigger a recall.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.760]   This is a good idea.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760]   Remember?
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.760]   It wasn't so long ago.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.640]   We have fitness trackers out in our Happy Meals.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.640]   Get the kids walking.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.800]   I applaud the intent.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.800]   70 reports have been filed.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.440]   Not merely of skin irritation, but burns and blisters.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.880]   Can't you just put tape on the... shouldn't they just issue tape to put on the back of
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.880]   it?
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.840]   No, once you burn a child, dude, you got to take that back.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.840]   Yeah, I got to.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.840]   It's just a lot of air bubbles.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.840]   Well, good news.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:49.720]   You're going to get either a yogurt tube or a bag of apple slices and a free replacement
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.040]   toy if you bring it back.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.800]   Your choice of a yogurt tube or a bag of apple slices.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:56.800]   Your choice.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.800]   I love children.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.960]   You're like, "Hey, sorry this happened."
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.760]   "Here, I'm a yogurt tube."
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.760]   Have some apple slices.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.760]   I don't even know what a yogurt tube is.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.480]   It's like yogurt.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.480]   I'm guessing.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.480]   Oh, a yogurt.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.480]   Yeah, it's a yogurt.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.160]   That's like candy in a health food wrapper.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.640]   Well, apple slices are okay, right?
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   It was...
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.680]   According to Scott Stein running for Cenot, it was a...
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.560]   It was a terrible fitness tracker.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.720]   In other words, not very accurate, but his son liked it.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.720]   If they're burning people, it's not nickel.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:32.720]   It must be the batteries heating up.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.720]   I don't know.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:34.720]   It was the other...
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   What was the other...
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.720]   Job grown up.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.720]   Job grown up.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.720]   No, it was the basis.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.440]   Intel recalled the basis.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.480]   More recently, the basis, yes.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.480]   Yes.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.480]   Because that literally did burn.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.480]   It got so hot it would burn.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.480]   Job grown got out of the tracker business because they had such trouble.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.480]   Which...
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.280]   And, well, the competition is pretty tough.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.680]   The only thing good about job loans, trackers, was their software.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.680]   Sorry.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.680]   I use...
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:03.520]   I use a Fitbit Blaze and I think that's pretty good.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.080]   That's my favorite.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.920]   I think Fitbit is probably...
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.920]   I'm wearing a...
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   They're the best seller.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.480]   They outsell even the Apple Watch.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.960]   I use the Misfit.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.560]   Oh, yeah, that's easy too.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.560]   I like the Misfit.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.560]   I'm surprised you wear it in your wrist, though.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.040]   I put it in my underwear.
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.720]   I didn't want to know that.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:28.960]   Well, when we get together for our colonoscopies, you were kind of like that.
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.040]   Somebody the chatroom said that's the ultimate in brown-nosing.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.040]   No.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.040]   No.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.040]   Okay.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.040]   All right.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.000]   I want to say if you were still doing the New Year's Eve show, we could do a New Year's
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.800]   Eve colonoscopy especially.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.800]   Oh, that would be good.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800]   For $50,000.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.400]   I'll do it on here.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.720]   That's terrible.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720]   Katie Kirk, I already did it.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.720]   Katie Kirk can do it.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.720]   You can do it.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.360]   She's way cuter.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360]   Sorry.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.360]   Okay.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:57.440]   So, okay.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.240]   So after Aloe, let's see.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.280]   Oh, oh, we can talk about the scoop.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.800]   The Samsung Scoop scoop.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800]   Hold on.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   We'll do the scoop.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.800]   Is there anything to do with the kitty litter?
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.280]   Al, you'll have to wait for that kind of scoop.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.280]   Not that kind of scoop.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.680]   We'll show today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:18.280]   If you're investing for the long haul, you know you need to actively manage your investments
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.200]   because if you just put them in a savings account, you might as well put in a mattress.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.080]   There's no money to be gained there.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.520]   Unfortunately, managing your investments is not trivial.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.800]   You could do it yourself, but it takes a lot of time, effort reading, study.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:38.240]   And if you're not an expert, frankly, that sounds dangerous.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.920]   You could go to an expert, that guy down the street.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.440]   He's got the shingle out there.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.480]   Finan, he's a wealth guidance counselor.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.160]   He's a financial advisor.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:54.640]   He will charge you or she between 1, 2, and 3% of what she manages every year.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.040]   Plus transaction fees and hidden costs, that means you have to make that much more just
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.880]   to break even.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.880]   So that's not good.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.400]   In today's stock market, you want every penny you can get.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.080]   That's why I like Wealthfront.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.400]   Wealthfront is automated investing, so it's less expensive.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.360]   Computers are cheap.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.560]   They charge you not 1 or 2 or 3% a year, but 1/4 of 1% a year.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.560]   Less than $5 a month for a $30,000 investment.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.800]   And there are never any additional charges like transaction fees.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.840]   You can get started investing today with as little as $500.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:33.560]   They're using very intelligent algorithms designed by some of the best experts.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:39.560]   They have over 200-- their experts have over 200 years of experience on the markets combined.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:44.760]   People like Charles D. Ellis, who wrote the Investors Guide to Wall Street, Burton, Matt
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:48.480]   Wall Street, and Burton Malkiel, who wrote that amazing and random walkdown Wall Street.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.080]   These guys have a deep understanding of how it all works.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.240]   And they've codified it into the software.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.880]   Plus it's easy to get involved.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:02.200]   They're using modern portfolio theory.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.680]   They adjust according to your personal risk tolerance.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.920]   They keep you diversified.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:12.920]   They also keep you tax efficient with things like tax-lost harvesting.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:18.440]   And you can keep track of every trade they make on your behalf on your dashboard on the
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.720]   website.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:23.600]   And it's fun because they do trade a lot.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:29.520]   They monitor your investment every minute constantly.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.520]   So here's the deal.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.840]   If you go to Wealthfront.com, I'm not saying invest right away.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.160]   I want you to read up on it and see what they do understand it better.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.600]   I think you'll be very impressed.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:40.360]   You'll be very impressed with their record, their track record.
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:46.400]   You also can get a free portfolio, which will give you an idea of how the intake experience
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.400]   is.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.200]   The few questions that they ask to establish your risk tolerance and your time frame, they've
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.200]   got it down.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.440]   It's very easy.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.440]   You'll get a portfolio.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.520]   You can just take it and say thank you and leave.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.480]   So do at least that.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.160]   You'll also, if you want, they'll also do a checkup on your current investments to see
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.320]   how diversified you are, whether they're tax efficient, that kind of thing.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.800]   They have 529 college savings plans.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.960]   Because if you're with kids or grandkids, you better be saving now.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.480]   Jeff and I know about that.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.280]   It's expensive.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.440]   They have the 529.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.440]   Stacey's.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.440]   Stacey's.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:26.240]   I know we looked it up just a couple of weeks ago as we reassessed our planning and I was
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.520]   like, good God.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.520]   I know.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:34.920]   When the kids were born, I read that I had to put away $1,000 a month for each of them.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.080]   Starting when they were born, I thought, what?
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.080]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:41.080]   Well, you got the 529 college savings plans now, though, by the way, which are like Roth
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.080]   IRAs.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.800]   They help you save.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.280]   And that's all at Wealthfront.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.280]   Wealthfront.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.280]   Here's the deal.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.280]   Go to wealthfront.com/tweg.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.200]   Take advantage of the free offers.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:55.480]   If you decide to invest, they will, as I said, it starts at $500.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.920]   That's the minimum investment, but they will manage your first $15,000 free of charge
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.040]   forever.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.120]   For college savings, this is great.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.320]   For retirement.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.320]   You can do it all.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.120]   There are a variety of ways you can do it.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.120]   Wealthfront.com/tweg.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:18.480]   It's the modern way to do this, the smart way to do it.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.480]   What is it?
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.480]   Samsung Scoop?
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.480]   Samsung Scoop.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.480]   It's an FCC filing.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.480]   Oh.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.840]   So this week, there were two exciting things from the FCC.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.800]   Oh, databases.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.920]   So the Scoop is one.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.120]   The other is a new E.K.B thermostat, but that's less exciting than a puzzle.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.320]   The Scoop is, though, has really, I think, taken nest to lunch, haven't they?
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.000]   According to an artically read--
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   It's not the phrase.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   That is not the phrase.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.360]   --that they've eaten nest's lunch, not taking them to lunch.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.520]   That means something completely different.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.880]   You're right.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.480]   E.K.B's better than nest.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.480]   It is.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.480]   I think it's a better thermostat.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.080]   The E.K.B.3 is a better thermostat than the nest.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.080]   But that's my studied opinion.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.600]   It's a good one, though.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.600]   And let's see.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.400]   They recently got 35 million.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.160]   Kevin and I on our show for tomorrow.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.960]   We talk about the new FCC filing.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.720]   But we did promise people Scoop.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.640]   So I want to stay sort of on track.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.640]   Scoop.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.640]   What is Scoop?
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.640]   We don't know.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.160]   But they think it's going to be like the Echo or possibly the Google Home.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.040]   So this is a tiny.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.440]   It looks more like a dot.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.800]   It has a wrist strap.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.720]   So it's probably like a dot size tap.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.080]   Was that just crazy?
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:41.520]   It says it's got a USB jack, a charging port, and play and sound control buttons.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520]   Volume.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.520]   That's the word I was talking about.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.280]   Won't you be disappointed if it's just Bluetooth speakers?
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.800]   That's kind of what I thought it looked like, to be totally honest.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.280]   There is a microphone.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:54.560]   So but yeah, I'm like eh.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.920]   Well, don't we really want Sonos as you can talk to?
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.000]   Yes.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.440]   So that's the promise of Google Home in all honesty to me.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.560]   It's the ears and mouth of your home.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.080]   Why don't we just right now?
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.080]   Hurry up Google.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:15.720]   Well, that or Sonos, I would prefer Sonos give us an API because I've already got the
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.880]   Sonos's.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.480]   How else am I going to be to use stuff you've already got?
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.720]   You know, I mean, I have tied my Google, my Echo tap.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.120]   No, my dot.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.920]   You've put your dot into a Sonos.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.520]   No, I do buy a Bluetooth into wireless speakers.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.560]   And there are people who've Jerry Rigget to work with Sonos.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.560]   But I would...
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.560]   You have to leave your Peter on.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.400]   Yeah, it's a pain.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.960]   I would really love to be able to talk to my Sonos.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.400]   You know, it's funny too, as I kind of...
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.600]   The Sonos is expensive.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.600]   And I always thought, oh, they're probably not very good speakers.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.000]   But I was listening the other day, we were having a party and we had party mode on the
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   Sonos.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.360]   And then I have a Sonos connected to my fancy expensive hi-fi.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.800]   And I thought the Sonos speakers actually sounded better, at least for a party.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.800]   They really sounded good.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.640]   Yeah, they built inside chips, optimized.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:11.600]   They did a lot with digital audio to make the speaker itself high quality.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.040]   Like a couple of years ago, I interviewed them and they talked a lot about this.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.920]   I think they did.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.320]   Because they're not huge.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.840]   You know, you'd think that the my subwoofer and my tower speakers should sound better
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:29.080]   than this little bookshelf speaker, but they don't.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.080]   They sound lovely.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.080]   They sound good.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.080]   And they usually use two.
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.080]   And they usually use two.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.080]   And they usually use two.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.080]   For left right, right?
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.080]   Okay.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.080]   Are they the threes or the five?
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.080]   No, I have all fives.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.080]   I have all fives.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.080]   Okay.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.480]   Have you optimized it with your iPhone so you can stand in the middle of the room and
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.040]   play the music and you should.
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.040]   It's actually pretty cool.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.040]   Does it make a difference?
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040]   It does make a difference.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.800]   Although maybe you can't hear it unless you've got it tied to your same son phone.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:57.280]   You're going to have my sonos in every room of the house we got.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.160]   But it's been over time.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.680]   It's very expensive, but I'm so all in on Sonos that I would like it to have the Amazon
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.680]   Echo capabilities.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:05.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:11.360]   Well, they won't have the not only the most recent ones have microphones.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.360]   Right.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.960]   And I don't have any of those.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960]   Okay.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.240]   So you would have to be able to talk to the Echo to make it happen.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.560]   I've got wired speakers in the ceiling and then like six bridges downstairs.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.720]   So I'm with you.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:25.720]   Let's make it work.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.720]   Go.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.000]   How hard is that Sonos just to talk to Amazon?
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.640]   They have to get an approval.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:36.160]   They have to release an API that's approved and we can talk about Amazon and their new
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.160]   music service.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.880]   Maybe maybe that one or five.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:43.800]   That's why maybe just one dies one comes five bucks music service, but it plays back on
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.200]   the crap Echo speakers.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.200]   I don't want that.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.200]   Right.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.200]   Neither do I.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.080]   I could tie my I could do is my dot.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.480]   But I mean, I listened to my Echo speaker.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:59.320]   I've got my I've got a Sonos in my kitchen and Sonos in my living room, but I listen
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.640]   to the Echo about half the time now because for books I do all the time.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.640]   It's so easy.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.640]   You just sad.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.240]   And I don't have it.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.840]   I, you know, if you don't, so one of the biggest things they change and we talked about
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.840]   it when they happened a couple of months ago is initially with Yastra music, it was
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.360]   it had to get it from Amazon Prime, which has such a constrains, you know, number of
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.240]   songs, only about a million songs compared to the 20 million on the other services.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:30.240]   But recently they allowed you to use Spotify as your default music service or Pandora.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.680]   So now I made Spotify my default music service and now I can say play something and it'll
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:37.680]   almost certainly have it because Spotify has everything.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.200]   And that works great.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.680]   And I listen to my Spotify playlists and I just, I don't have to say Spotify anymore.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.960]   I just say, you know, listen to my coffee house playlist and it'll play.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:46.960]   It's nice.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:53.960]   Ooh, one of your chat room people posted on GitHub a HTTP API for Sonos.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:54.960]   You've seen that.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.360]   Don't I have to have a compute?
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.360]   Isn't that the one?
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360]   You do.
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.880]   So, but you know, I didn't think about this, but if you stuck it on a pie, could you just
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.880]   that running?
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:03.880]   I bet you I could.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:04.880]   All right.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:05.880]   I got a pie lying around.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:06.880]   Peek out.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.280]   I got a pie lying around.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.520]   I could leave that on.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.960]   So yeah, because I'd leave a pie on, but not.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.840]   Well, I also have a server running all the time in the house.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:16.840]   Okay.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.280]   I'm maybe I should sit down and get to work on that.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.480]   But that again, maybe.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.480]   Okay.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:27.640]   I just feel like it would probably work better and be easier if it would just be endorsed
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.600]   and supported by Amazon and Sonos.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:34.400]   Oh, well, yeah, because not like, I mean, Jeff is like, you guys are geeks, but so most
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.520]   people are not going to be like, Oh, I'll just pull some cloth off GitHub and run it
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.880]   on a pie that I'm lying around.
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:39.880]   It's easy.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:45.280]   You just clone that, compile it, put it on your raspberry pie.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.480]   She yeah, I've known about this one for a while.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.720]   She's node Sonos API.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:55.280]   You know, it would be cool is if you could put what if somebody did a Tindy and you stuck,
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:00.720]   you stuck basically this on a pie and made it just work and then you could sell, you
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:04.720]   know, basically the Sonos API on a stick.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.720]   That might be fine.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.720]   That's legal.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.440]   No, probably not.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.800]   Why wouldn't it be?
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.200]   Because Sonos.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.200]   Well, what?
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.200]   Okay.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.200]   So legal is not the issue.
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.200]   It's not the issue.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200]   It's the issue.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.200]   So, you know, you're not going to be able to, you know, just a few minutes.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.200]   I mean, you're going to be able to do that.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.200]   And I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.200]   And I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.200]   And I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.200]   And I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.200]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.200]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.200]   And I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.200]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.200]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.200]   So, I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.200]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.200]   So, I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.200]   And I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.200]   So cheap, you just sell another one.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.200]   Yeah, if you can sell it for $50.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.200]   That's not that cheap, man.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.200]   If I sell $50, I'm so happy.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.200]   If you spend as much as you spend on Sonos, it's nothing.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.200]   Oh, my God.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.200]   I don't want to think about it.
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.200]   It's so expensive.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:58.200]   Chase is going to start supporting Android Pay next month, September 7th.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:03.200]   Isn't that weird that they didn't?
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.200]   Why don't...
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.200]   Now, there's a big battle brewing.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:09.200]   We talked about this on Mac Break Weekly yesterday in Australia.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.200]   And I think this is legit.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.200]   The Mac Break Weekly guys did not.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.200]   They defended it.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:23.200]   But, you know, so a number of Australian banks and retailers have complained to the Australian
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:29.560]   Competitive Board and they want because they say Apple is being anti-competitive by not
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:34.320]   allowing them access to the NFC chip on an iPhone.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:39.480]   If you're going to use Tap to Pay on an iPhone, it has to be Apple Pay, period, because Apple
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.800]   Pay is the only company that can access that NFC chip.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.120]   They say, "You got to open up...
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:51.080]   You got to make Apple open up that NFC chip so that we can make our own Tap to Pay solutions."
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.520]   And I hadn't really thought about this, but in a way, Android Pay on Android and Apple
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.440]   Pay on iOS have kind of a monopoly.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.400]   Android Pay less so because there are other solutions.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:07.040]   I use Samsung Pay, for instance, because this NFC chip is available.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:11.120]   And I think Samsung Pay is just as secure as Android Pay is just as secure as Apple Pay.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.360]   It's not an issue of security.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.080]   It's a issue of competition.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.480]   Apple can take as much of a cut as they want because if you're going to use an iPhone
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.840]   and Tap to Pay, Apple...
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.800]   You can only use Apple Pay.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:27.440]   So the Australian Competition Competitive Board has to issue a ruling over what's more
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:33.440]   any competitive, all the banks and retailers in Australia getting together and complaining
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:37.560]   or what Apple's doing with its NFC.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.880]   And I think that they're right.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.880]   Are there security?
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.040]   I mean, Apple usually argues security when it closes off.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:50.840]   And I'd be curious to see what kind of filings end up, like how technically true that it is.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.840]   I'm sure they'll raise the specter of security.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:18:00.400]   But like I said, I don't feel any less secure using Samsung Pay or Android Pay because an
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:03.000]   open NFC chip doesn't mean, well, I don't know.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000]   Maybe you can hack it.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   I haven't seen the Amazon.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.480]   Well, that's why I want to see the technical documentation that they'll ask for because
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:11.480]   that's a good chance to answer that.
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.360]   Apple's going to absolutely say, "Oh, well, we can't let everybody have access to NFC."
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.120]   That would compromise our platform.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.680]   Of course, they're going to say that.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.960]   Anyway, that fight we'll hear more about that in a couple of weeks when the Australian
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:30.720]   Competition Board rules.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.200]   Do we care about Google phasing out Chrome apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux?
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.200]   I was wondering about it.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.200]   Should I care?
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.680]   I mean, I'm on a Chromebook, so it doesn't matter to me.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:40.680]   On my Mac.
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:41.640]   I can't use the same apps.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:47.240]   I think the reason it's hard to explain this is nobody knows and myself included what's
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:49.440]   an app and what's an extension.
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.160]   I can continue.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.640]   The apps will not.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.640]   I feel like I have.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.960]   I think I'm using one app.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:58.960]   I think that's probably the case.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.520]   I mean, I'm looking at my app store.
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:06.000]   On Google Chrome, you have on the left of your bookmark bar, you have the show apps thing,
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.520]   and then you'll see all the apps.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.120]   These say apps, but most of these are not apps.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.840]   They're just extensions, Chrome extensions.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.800]   So what am I going to lose?
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.160]   I'm on Linux right now.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:25.080]   I have to say it's fabulous because it means that I can do a lot of things in Chromium.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.600]   I'm not even using Chromium using the open source Chromium on Linux that would be hard
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:36.240]   otherwise because there's no Linux app for because it's developed for all cross platform.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:37.600]   Now is Google Photos an app?
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.760]   They're calling it an app, but I don't know if it's an app.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.760]   What does that mean?
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:43.920]   Does that mean no Google Photos?
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.360]   No, it just means you go to photos.google.com.
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.280]   Instead of clicking a button, I'm not sure what this means.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.040]   I don't think this is a bad thing.
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.160]   Oh, will this affect?
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.160]   Okay, hold on.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:00.880]   Let me open up something new and see what happens.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:05.440]   I mean, like dots or docs, docs and all of that.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.160]   Are those the apps that we're talking about?
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.960]   Because those are the actual apps that I have.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.960]   I don't know.
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:12.960]   Yeah, I'm confused.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.960]   So apps are standalone.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:18.440]   Okay, yeah, then I'm only running one of those.
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:26.680]   You can go to Google Docs on Google Drive on your web so you're not going to lose it.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:34.400]   But the apps on Mac and I guess on Linux, I guess on Linux, on the Mac for sure, you
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:38.640]   get in your doc, you get an apps icon.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.840]   I think it's almost optics.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.600]   Even if Chrome's not running, you can run that app.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:46.720]   But of course Chrome is kind of running because as soon as you launch that app, Chrome's the
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.520]   back end for that.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:52.960]   So I don't really know.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.640]   Sorry, y'all.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.960]   Well, yeah, Google says the usage numbers are low.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:06.160]   Approximately 1% of users on Windows, Mac, and Linux actively use Chrome packaged apps.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.160]   And this is the key.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:10.240]   Most hosted apps are already implemented as regular web apps.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.320]   So this may be a distinction without a difference.
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:17.240]   This may not be something that anybody's going to lose any sleepover.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.240]   Maybe that's part of it.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:23.520]   It's just like people didn't even know what they were.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:29.920]   So middle out compression is coming to Silicon Valley and I'm not talking the TV show.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:35.840]   Google is going to start using artificial intelligence to compress photos.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:41.800]   And as as Quartz says, just like on Silicon Valley, the TV show.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.520]   It's not middle out compression, but it's the next big thing.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:51.000]   Neural networks to do compression.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.360]   That's how a pipe-pied piper does it.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.760]   Didn't they just have an algorithm?
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.760]   It wasn't a neural network.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:57.760]   Was it?
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:58.760]   They said it was a neural network, apparently.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.760]   Oh, OK.
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:00.760]   Really?
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:01.760]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:02.760]   That's fiction.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:03.760]   It's a good picture.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.760]   They made it up.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:05.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:06.760]   Would you say did you like it or not?
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:07.760]   Oh, no.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.760]   I said I got sick of that show.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.760]   So I stuck on it.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:10.760]   Sick of it.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.760]   It was too real.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:18.400]   So funny, Bill Atkinson, one of the creators of the Macintosh, I asked him if you watched
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.400]   he said no, it's too real.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.400]   Fuck.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.400]   Seriously.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.640]   I don't want to go through that again.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.720]   It's like I spend all day on this.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.080]   I do not want to watch it.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.920]   Watch this at home.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.640]   So that's cool.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.640]   Neural networks.
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.920]   There are going to be Google's using them everywhere.
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.400]   I mean, everybody's using them everywhere.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:41.720]   Google and Facebook are really like taking it to the next level with their machine learning.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:46.080]   And we're going to see a lot of really cool stuff.
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:50.680]   And then we're also not going to see a lot of cool stuff that is just going to make things
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.800]   a little bit smoother and it's going to be nice.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.600]   You're a Fi customer, right, Jeff?
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.600]   Fi?
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.600]   Google Fi?
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.600]   Yeah, on my second phone.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.880]   So I mainly use outside the country.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.880]   I didn't even know about this.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:06.880]   I'm a Fi user.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:09.800]   This is my Nexus 6P.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:13.240]   There is a thing called a Wi-Fi assistant.
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.760]   I don't know what this is.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.760]   Apparently--
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:19.560]   Well, you see because you don't know because you don't know when you switch between the
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.040]   two cell services but also Wi-Fi.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.040]   It will switch you seamlessly among all three.
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.040]   Right.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.840]   So you never know what you're on.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:35.120]   But every time I go around and the only Wi-Fi's Starbucks makes you sign in.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.120]   Everybody else makes New York subway makes you sign in.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.440]   New York Street makes you sign in.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.880]   So what is it that's open that this can get into?
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:50.160]   You can't get into Comcast networks because you're not a Comcast customer.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.760]   You can't get into the AT&T network because it's not AT&T.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.920]   So what Wi-Fi is this signing you into?
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.760]   It's not going to come to other Nexus phones, which sounds great.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.080]   I don't understand what it does for you.
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.840]   So it says, "You?"
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:10.640]   Open Android settings, tap the Google item.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.520]   Here's the Google item.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.320]   And then from the Google item, tap "networking."
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.320]   Okay.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.320]   Good, good, good.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.280]   Ah, use open Wi-Fi automatically.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.720]   I have it turned off.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.160]   Automatically connect to Wi-Fi.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.960]   That is so dangerous.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:24.960]   Yes.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:28.960]   I recommend people don't even have their Wi-Fi on when they're out and about if they don't
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:29.960]   want to be tracked.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:31.960]   If you go to-- what was it?
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:32.960]   Defcon?
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.960]   That is a place.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.960]   Yeah, what was it?
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:37.960]   What do they call that thing?
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:43.960]   Defcon, if you go there, you guarantee that what appears to be a Wi-Fi access point is
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.000]   just hacker Joe's laptop down the hall.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.920]   And if you join that, it will have it help you.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:56.640]   Well just the act of trying to find an open Wi-Fi network, your phone basically shares
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.760]   its data about what other Wi-Fi networks it's connected to.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:07.600]   So that's how a lot of companies like Euclid and others get like demographic data.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:13.240]   There's Peter Thiel invested in a company that does Wi-Fi, free Wi-Fi for coffee shops.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:20.520]   And that's one of the big ways they're getting data on people that you sign in and get to
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.520]   get the data.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.120]   Well, hackers use it too because here's the method of attack.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.280]   I query your phone.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:29.720]   Tell me about the Wi-Fi networks you know.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:36.000]   If you're the one that you join like your home Wi-Fi automatically, then I'm sitting in
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   the coffee shop.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.360]   I rename my access point to that.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.680]   Use my pineapple router or whatever to name it to that.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.480]   You see a strong signal.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:45.560]   It's your home router.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.680]   Oh, who knew I could get this in my, you don't do it.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:49.680]   Their phone does it.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.360]   Oh, and joins the home router automatically.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.040]   And all of a sudden you don't see anything.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:01.320]   You're on your home router sending all your information through the bad guy's pineapple.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.600]   That's not what you want.
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:07.400]   So I turn off the XFINITY thing that you know, don't use that.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.760]   Oh, they're public Wi-Fi thing on your own.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:10.760]   Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:11.760]   Or a modem.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.760]   Yeah, and router.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:13.760]   Here's a food.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:14.760]   Go ahead.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:19.960]   Oh, I was going to say on that, if you don't use their modem, does it still create the
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:20.960]   public hotspot?
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:26.400]   Because it's just, sorry, if you don't use their router, yes.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:30.440]   If you don't use their gear basically that you have to lease and pay for, does it still
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.920]   create a public Wi-Fi hotspot on XFINITY?
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:33.920]   Okay.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.880]   So it's only people, and I think it's all consumer users, I don't know, but you have
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:43.360]   to buy a dual router Wi-Fi or you don't have to, but that's what Comcast puts in your house
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:50.000]   if they can, is a cable modem router with Wi-Fi.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.080]   And if you don't turn it off, it automatically creates another channel that is the XFINITY
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.640]   Wi-Fi.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.240]   It's all over Austin.
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:59.240]   They have everywhere, right?
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:01.680]   We have time order cable, which...
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:05.080]   Why did I think Austin was one of the worst places for it?
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:08.080]   Petaluma, it's all over here.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.600]   But the problem is half the time it doesn't give, I don't get bandwidth.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:15.240]   Now Google does say in this setting, high quality Wi-Fi, so they're doing something
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:17.080]   to check the Wi-Fi.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.080]   But I don't know.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.600]   I don't know if that's a good thing.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:20.600]   Where was the setting again?
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.600]   I couldn't have missed it.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.600]   So you go...
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.600]   It'll be...
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.600]   Maybe it's on new cash.
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.600]   Go to settings.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:26.600]   You go to settings.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:27.600]   Google.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.600]   Google.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:32.240]   And then you go down to networking, and it's the only setting.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.240]   They're on hand, and...
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.240]   Oh, they were networking.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.240]   Okay.
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:37.200]   And then it says, "use open Wi-Fi automatically."
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.200]   On a Mac, I think it's a go on.
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:39.920]   On a Mac, I go to Wi-Fi at select locations.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:43.560]   That means I probably turned mine off, because I bet it defaults to on.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.560]   Yeah, I went back.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.640]   It mines on.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.600]   It does seem on the face of it, dangerous.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:54.760]   But on the other hand, Google, we know, is pretty sophisticated about online hazards.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:58.240]   I don't think they would let me do anything dangerous.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.040]   Wi-Fi assistant auto connects you to high quality, high quality, public Wi-Fi hotspots,
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.040]   and helps secure your connection.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:11.320]   To help protect you on public Wi-Fi, your data is transmitted through a secure VPN managed
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.320]   by Google.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.320]   Wow.
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.320]   That's how they do it.
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.320]   That's how they do it.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.240]   A key will appear at the top of your screen.
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:20.680]   Well, Google's in the middle, but I trust Google.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:21.680]   Yes.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.840]   So I'm turning it back on.
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:31.080]   So that way, the hacker with the pineapple down, how many purely open networks are there?
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:32.680]   There's a lot.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:34.480]   Someone just put in that there's 500.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.720]   Oh, these aren't purely open.
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.560]   You have to log in with your subscriber account.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:39.560]   It's the most captive portals.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.760]   But I think they're enough.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:46.360]   I've whined about this on the show before.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:49.440]   I wish just for once Starbucks Google runs Starbucks Wi-Fi.
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.800]   Ah, maybe that's it because Google does.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.640]   It's Google Wi-Fi.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:58.800]   But all I want to do is I want to sign one thing once that says, yes, yes, I will not
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:02.400]   do porn or blow up the world or do horrible things on the Internet.
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:06.600]   Just let me join you once and for all every time I go into Starbucks, just put me on.
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.600]   Right.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.600]   Get boingo.
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.800]   That was like that's what those services were for, right?
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.800]   Right.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:12.800]   But that's expensive too.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:13.800]   That adds up.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.800]   Yes, it is.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:21.520]   Oh, if you went to Defcon, speaking of Defcon, you may have noticed this is from a piece
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:22.520]   on GitHub.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:26.560]   He stayed in actually motherboard reported this.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:31.600]   Jeffrey Vaughn is a security researcher who stayed at Caesars Palace in the Paris Hotel,
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.760]   which is across the street in Vegas.
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:37.560]   During that time, he walked around the strip, went shopping with his wife, and he went to
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:40.000]   Defcon.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.080]   And when he arrived before the start of Black Hat Defcon, there were eight GSM towers in
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.760]   the neighborhood.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:51.240]   By the time the conferences started, there were 38.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:55.920]   Now of course you could, you might say, oh, well, I'm sure they turned on more towers
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:58.440]   for conference attendees.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:03.120]   But knowing it's Defcon, I would guess that a few of these were what we call stingrays,
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:06.480]   which are phony cell towers, law enforcement uses them.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:11.160]   But with a Raspberry Pi and a couple of hundred bucks, you could build one yourself.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:16.560]   These are probably fake access points from phone networks that your phone would just
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:21.240]   join and all your stuff would go through these stingrays.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:27.640]   It's about 1500 bucks to build your own low cost stingray.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:28.640]   Yep.
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:34.720]   So when they say don't use a cell phone or smartphone, don't use a laptop at Defcon,
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.520]   and they mean it.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.760]   They mean it.
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:40.480]   Do you go to Defcon Stacy?
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:45.760]   No, because I don't have a burner computer that I want to think.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.760]   I send my priest.
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:48.760]   There he goes.
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:49.760]   Father Robert goes.
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.600]   I figure he's safe.
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.680]   He's not going to get in trouble.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:58.520]   Actually, this looks like the way they do this Wi-Fi assistant.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.320]   That looks smart with a VPN and everything.
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:04.560]   I'll have to ask Steve to give somebody things about it.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.160]   You always have the secret weapon.
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:08.160]   You got Steve.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.160]   I got Steve.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:14.600]   The Moto Z's rolling out and the Moto Z of course was kind of cool.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:23.040]   It's very skinny and it has a bunch of magnetic backs that add features like improved battery.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.000]   Here's a new one that just came out.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:30.640]   A hostile, flawed camera back for your Moto Z.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:40.240]   What? 10x optical zoom, Hasselblad known for high-end medium format cameras.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:47.320]   They say maybe at IFA next month in Germany, the Moto Z Hasselblad back.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:50.360]   Now I'm tempted.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.120]   It doesn't take much to tempt me.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.440]   No, it doesn't take much.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.440]   I'm easy.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.880]   Google's fiber markets.
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:59.200]   You're in a Google fiber market.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.200]   Austin, you can't get it.
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:04.080]   I know Stacey because you're too far.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.360]   I call that reason to move Stacey.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.560]   But you get a benefit.
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.560]   You get a benefit.
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:13.920]   Comcast would offer me cheaper service if they lived in.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.920]   Except that's a hard plan to find.
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:16.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:21.400]   This is from the next web, Brian Clark writes, Comcast hopes you don't notice it's twice
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:25.400]   as expensive in non-Google fiber markets.
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.880]   Competition.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:31.280]   Is there anything it can't do?
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:36.200]   Do you have Comcast data?
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:37.200]   I don't have Comcast.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.360]   Comcast is in my market.
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:40.120]   I have a time Warner cable.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.880]   Also, you don't know.
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:47.760]   But I will say John Brodkin over at ours, Technica, he called the Comcast $70 gigabit
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:53.920]   deal the Kaiser Soze of Internet offers because some Comcast reps can't even find it.
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:56.680]   No one can get it.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:00.280]   So it's worth noting that it's possible you could get this but you could have to work
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.280]   for it.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.280]   They don't promote it.
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:07.160]   It's actively being hidden but they apparently according to Comcast responding to an ours
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:11.920]   Technica piece, they said no, no, you can get it.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.200]   You just got to know where it looked.
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.200]   You know where.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.200]   So here's the thing.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.160]   Take a left at Jimmy Hoffa and there it is.
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.360]   You'll find it.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:21.360]   Sorry.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.400]   It's $70 gigabit.
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:24.400]   I don't know.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.400]   Someone was asking.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:27.280]   I'm getting it.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.000]   Even if you're in Austin.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.760]   But if you're not in a Google market, you could pay twice that.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:38.760]   And I on the other hand can get no gigabit despite putting cat six cable in my house just
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:39.760]   in case if you get a gigabit.
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:40.760]   It's going to come.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.400]   I have faith.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.920]   You know, cat six is so last year.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.720]   We have cat six a.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:48.280]   Dang it.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:51.080]   Well, I wanted conduit but that's like twice the cost.
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:52.760]   That wasn't going to happen.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.520]   Let me see if I can find this picture.
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:34:03.120]   I took a of Russell, our brilliant IT guy without whom we have cat seven infrastructure
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:06.080]   infrastructure without whom without Russell.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.920]   I don't know if we'd be on the air right now.
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:09.440]   The poor guy stayed up late.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.280]   But here's Russell stringing our cat six a cable.
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.840]   I don't know why it's baby blue.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:15.840]   That's not a requirement.
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:18.440]   He says they just ran out of the other color.
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.160]   But that's 10 gigabit.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.480]   It's a cable that's found in the feminine song.
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:23.480]   Yes.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:32.400]   That's 10 gigabit cat six a but we have cat seven for infrastructure inside the studio.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.600]   How much that cost is that?
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:38.840]   Is that the wires with gold on them?
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:40.840]   It's okay.
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.920]   What have you bought?
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:47.920]   Did you ask them how much conduit would have been?
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:51.120]   Oh, we have conduit but you have to put something in the conduit.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:56.520]   Well, no, I wanted like that was my option was like I'd have to spend money on conduit
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.360]   and then I could replace my cables that will.
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.200]   It makes it easy to pull new cable.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:01.200]   Right.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.760]   But that was so expensive that we were just like just let's.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.440]   That's your home.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.440]   This is my business.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.000]   It's got conduit up the butt.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.720]   This is TV studio Stacey.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.400]   And by the way, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Tom Hanks are joining me for conduit up
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.400]   about later today.
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:23.320]   Oh man, that joke is never going to die.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:28.560]   Oh, oh, let's take a break because you know what I'm doing in about as soon as it shows
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.560]   over.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:35.560]   I'm hopping in the Tesla and driving down to Shoreline amphitheater to see cheap trick
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:40.080]   Joan Jett and heart in concert.
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.080]   Take a wild guess.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:42.720]   You know what these people are.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:50.520]   Take a wild guess whose idea that was wasn't mine, but it'll be fun.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:53.040]   I think it'll be a lot of fun.
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.920]   We probably do have rose gold cables for the cat seven.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.000]   I would think.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.480]   That's the best, you know, rose gold.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.480]   Better that is better.
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:02.480]   I have rose gold jewelry.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.480]   Do you?
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:04.480]   Must be.
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:05.480]   Of course.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:06.640]   Your rose gold jewelry is not pink.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:09.640]   It's actually rose gold, right?
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:14.080]   Apple really diluted the rose gold, I think.
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.960]   Yes, mine is a very warm.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.720]   Yeah, it's gold with a little copper in there.
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.680]   Yes, copper is the right way to think that.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:25.480]   Not pink as apple would have it.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:26.480]   Yes.
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.840]   Our show today.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:28.840]   I'm sorry, I don't know.
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.520]   I'm beating a dead horse here.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.160]   Our show today brought to you by my mattress.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.360]   Oh, you want a good night's sleep.
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.360]   Trust me.
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.560]   That's it's everything.
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.640]   It's everything a good night's sleep.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:45.080]   And you can get one on your new Casper mattress.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:46.800]   Casper, you probably heard about them.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:51.360]   They're an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:55.040]   They're really changing the way people buy mattresses.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:59.400]   Not only do they cut the cost of the mattress because instead of going to a reseller or
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.360]   showroom, you're buying direct from the factory, the factory's in the US, by the way, but they've
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:07.960]   also changed how people think of buying a mattress in terms of choosing a mattress with
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:08.960]   Casper.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:13.240]   You don't get five minutes on a mattress in broad daylight under the steely gaze of
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:17.800]   a shop clerk wondering if you're going to put your shoes on their nice mattress.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.200]   No, you get to buy the mattress.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.960]   They send it to you in a very surprisingly compact box.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:25.960]   You open the box and the mattress opens up.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:29.160]   It's light, it's comfortable, it's springy, but firm.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:33.360]   You put it on the bed and now, only now the clock starts ticking.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:36.480]   You have 100 days to decide if you want to keep it.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:40.400]   If you don't like the Casper mattress, I'm not talking five minutes.
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.120]   I'm talking 100 nights.
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:44.040]   They will pick it up for free.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.600]   They actually give it to charity.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.800]   They don't ship it back to the factory.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:49.120]   They give it to charity and they give you back every penny.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.680]   There's no risk at all.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:52.400]   It's really the right way to buy a mattress.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:56.720]   No wonder they're an award-winning sleep surface with just the right sink and just the right
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.720]   bounce.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:02.320]   They won the 2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation Award.
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:07.720]   It's the hottest summer in history.
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:09.680]   The Casper sleeps cool.
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:12.480]   That's another big part of getting a good night's sleep.
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:17.800]   It's not sweltering in your bed, but just breathe.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:19.640]   Buy it online.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:20.800]   Try it out.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.800]   You will love it.
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:22.800]   I love it.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:23.800]   Free delivery.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.440]   Painless returns.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.640]   The Casper mattress is just right.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:31.080]   Free shipping and returns in the US and Canada.
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:33.760]   They start as low as $500 for a twin plus.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:37.560]   We're going to give you an additional $50 off by going to Casper.
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:44.120]   C-A-S-P-E-R, Casper.com/twig and using our offer code TWIG.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:46.640]   Some terms and conditions apply.

[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:53.480]   Don't forget the offer code TWIG.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.560]   I love my Casper.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.560]   You will too.
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:56.560]   Yes.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:58.800]   Did you get a Casper dog bed for Ollie?
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:38:59.800]   No.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.040]   When I just found out, I didn't even know they didn't even tell me.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.040]   But, absolutely.
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:03.720]   Ozzy is going to...
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:04.720]   We've ordered Ozzy.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:05.720]   Ozzy.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:07.720]   Casper dog bed.
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:10.480]   Yeah, looking up, it's great.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:12.720]   We would get a small because Ozzy is teensy-winky.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:14.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:17.480]   Oh, that looks so nice.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.480]   Oh, man.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:21.800]   Ozzy's small for dogs up to 30 pounds.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:24.160]   Yeah, Ozzy's going to be mad at me that I didn't catch him at.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:27.360]   There's pictures of dogs in them, which I kind of like because they kind of just smoosh
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.360]   in.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:29.360]   Oh, man.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:32.200]   Oh, man.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.200]   My dog would eat this in a heartbeat.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.200]   He would eat it.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.200]   Oh, man.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:40.760]   My dog's current bed is like a memory foam little bed for it.
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:42.840]   He's chewing it up or she's chewing it up, brother.
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:44.840]   Look at that.
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:48.320]   Well, this is memory foam on the bottom, which is the firm part.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:51.640]   And then on the top part, they've got latex that's more springy, so it's kind of firm
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:52.880]   and soft.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:53.880]   Wow.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:54.880]   Wow.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:55.880]   So, okay, look at this.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:58.280]   Dogs dig or scratch before lying down.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:01.080]   By the way, little copy editing there.
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:04.080]   It should be lying down, not laying down.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.080]   Right?
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:06.080]   Yes.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.280]   They're not from Texas.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:11.920]   That's an instinct they inherit from their wild ancestors who would kick up dirt to find
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.160]   cooler ground and brush away debris.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.080]   I didn't know this before turning into the night.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:21.920]   Our surface features excess material on top to mimic the sensation of bowing at loose
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:22.920]   earth.
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:25.360]   Oh, how thoughtful is that?
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.360]   Oh.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:27.360]   What?
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.360]   There's not a hydrant in there.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:29.360]   Is there?
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:30.360]   I'm not going to continue to watch that video.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.080]   I don't know what's where's that going?
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:35.320]   Oh, look at that.
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.000]   They like tight spaces, right?
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:43.360]   Because if you're safer and closed, where is the Casper cat bed?
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.360]   Cats sleep on Sonos says, come on, Jeff.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.360]   Yeah, don't you know?
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.720]   This is awesome.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.720]   Perfect for humans too.
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:53.880]   I'm not sleeping on a dog bed.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.280]   You kind of already are, Leo.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.880]   I guess I am.
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:02.720]   You get so people are sharing their pictures of their dogs on Casper dog beds.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:03.720]   That's cute.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.880]   Aw, that was cute.
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:06.640]   We don't have a discount for the dog bed.
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.640]   Sorry.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640]   Dang it.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.640]   Just the mattress.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.560]   So they have, I see that they have the 100 day gear or return policy.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:16.480]   So the dog, if you don't choose it, yeah.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.480]   Oh.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:20.800]   They have a 100 night trial free returns for the dog bed.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.880]   For the dog bed.
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:23.880]   Sleep on it.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:24.880]   Lounge on it.
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:25.880]   Doesn't love the dog mattress.
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:26.880]   We'll give you a full refund.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.120]   But what if she loves it too much and eats it?
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:32.880]   By the way, they say that's almost two dog years.
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:33.880]   Yes.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.880]   That's funny.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:38.320]   That's very funny.
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:39.320]   All right.
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:42.600]   We're going to wrap things up with your tips and picks.
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:43.920]   We're there, aren't we?
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.000]   Yes, we are.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.640]   I know it goes so fast.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.160]   I love this show.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.400]   I look forward to it every week.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:52.040]   I hope you all at home.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:54.040]   Do you want?
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:59.840]   What would you, I can have Stacy start if you'd like.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.840]   Yeah, please.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:01.840]   Who?
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:02.840]   I'm prepared.
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.840]   So it's National Waffle Day, you guys.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:05.840]   Yes.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:09.480]   Coming to us from the home of Chicken and Waffles, Austin, Texas.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:11.120]   Stacy, you can back them.
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:13.920]   This is old, but if you don't know about it, it's called Will It Waffle.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.920]   It's a cookbook.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:15.920]   It's a website.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:19.000]   And you can buy it for like five bucks.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.440]   And there you go.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:24.480]   It is everything you would not believe in making it in a waffle iron.
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:26.240]   So I will like kill you.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.760]   You can waffle kiss the deer.
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:28.760]   Oh, I'm sold.
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:31.320]   I am immediately sold.
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:33.480]   These are the best.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:36.960]   These are waffled hash browns.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:39.560]   And yeah, yeah, here they are.
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.240]   Here's a picture.
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:43.320]   Oh.
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:48.480]   The only downside to them is that it takes like 11 minutes to make in your waffle iron.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:51.760]   So you really should have two if you're going to like serve more than one person.
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:54.400]   So they need like a waffle line, a sibling line.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.720]   But they also have, and I'm just going to show you this because I think it's ridiculous,
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.040]   but awesome.
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:04.040]   Waffled soft-shelled crab.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:06.040]   Oh, she's.
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.560]   Oh, that's cruel.
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.480]   Now the crabs are dead.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.480]   That's dead, Jeff.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:14.000]   You don't waffle them before they're dead.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000]   It's not like a lobster.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.880]   I like that notion of using the waffle iron as a crisper.
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:19.880]   Yes.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:20.880]   And there's a great.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:25.120]   And you show the picture of the quesadilla because I love a really brown taste.
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:26.280]   This hash brown thing is amazing.
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:30.720]   I have a Belgian waffle iron that you put the thing in and then you turn it.
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:31.720]   Oh, perfect.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.720]   So oh, look at that.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:34.720]   Perfect.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:40.760]   I mean, guys, like you just until you have this cookbook, which is so ridiculously fun.
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:44.840]   Oh, oh, waffled wontons.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:46.800]   Can you do mac and cheese waffles?
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.880]   Yes, they do.
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:51.160]   They have a waffle mac and cheese.
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:53.400]   They have waffle mac and veganists.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:55.000]   Yes, of course.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.080]   This is Texas waffled salmon.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:00.040]   Well, the hash browns are just roosty.
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:01.040]   Or what?
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.040]   Roosty.
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:03.040]   What's roosty?
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:04.040]   That's in Switzerland.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.040]   They would.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.040]   It's their potatoes.
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:07.040]   Yeah, it's their other.
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.040]   Oh, killer roosty.
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:12.560]   So just because I don't want to buy the book, just tell me how to make hash breads of my
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:13.560]   waffle iron.
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:15.160]   Just spray it with bam.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:20.120]   And then I put the shredded potatoes in there cooked.
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.800]   It's so simple.
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:25.400]   You thought your shredded potatoes, you can either shred them yourselves if you're just
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:28.560]   a masochist or you can buy the frozen hash brown mix.
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:33.960]   I like to micro them a little bit to get them soft and then crisp them up.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:37.800]   So in this case, you dump the bag in.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.360]   You soak up the water with the tea towel.
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:42.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:46.360]   Add some rosemary, pepper, and corn may.
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:48.360]   You can boil some spices.
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.600]   The boy doesn't want spices.
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:53.600]   Melted butter on the waffle iron.
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:54.600]   Yeah, forget the pams.
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:56.800]   And then you just jam that sucker in.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.680]   Yeah, don't use Pam on your waffle iron.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.240]   It's going to create a visit.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:04.600]   Hey, oh, Marty, Steve, Tommy, come on over for the Call and Ask Me Party.
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.480]   We'll have waffle hash browns.
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:09.040]   And we can play spit.
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.040]   No, you can't eat.
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:12.520]   Yeah, you can't eat with that.
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:14.000]   Oh, no, that's why they get together.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.680]   They're not allowed to eat.
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:16.680]   You can.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:20.440]   So I'm trying to remember how long you cook it because it's a long time.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:23.600]   Two minutes and then you got to press it more and then 10 minutes more.
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:25.760]   I'll know when it's when it starts to burn.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:26.760]   It'll be perfect.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:27.760]   You will.
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:29.360]   So it's super fun.
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:33.720]   And since it's National Waffle Day, I encourage everyone to go experiment with your waffle
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:34.720]   iron.
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:37.000]   That is the single best tip we have ever.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.200]   Period, Don, waffle iron.
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:41.040]   So you're not just for waffles anymore.
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:42.680]   Tire the tips.
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:44.440]   All right.
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:45.840]   There you go.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:46.840]   Very nice.
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.640]   And oh, I did put a story in there just in case anyone cares.
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:53.920]   But apparently Nike's were designed first with waffle irons.
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:54.920]   Oh my gosh.
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:55.920]   I did know that actually.
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:56.920]   It was.
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:59.800]   I was like, oh, everything is normal today.
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.640]   Obviously they didn't use dough.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:05.280]   They used rubber.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:06.280]   Rubber.
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.520]   I mean, in case you were wondering.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:10.520]   Shoes made of waffles.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.520]   Not so good.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:12.520]   That all runs so good.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:13.520]   Great.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:18.280]   Great traction briefly.
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:19.280]   That looks good.
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:20.280]   And that is on Amazon.
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:22.440]   And what is the name of it one more time?
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:23.440]   Will it waffle?
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:24.440]   Will it be?
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:28.680]   And it is by Daniel Shumski.
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.480]   And yes, you see the blog there with all kinds of stuff.
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:33.640]   Well, cheese with ham and cheese.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:34.640]   Yes.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.200]   Well, show me what I'm sorry.
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:40.380]   - I mean please do show us the macaroni and cheese.
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:42.640]   - Oh fine okay, hold on.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:44.000]   - I wanna see that.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.680]   ♪ Mac 'n Cheese ♪
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:47.720]   - I haven't made the mac and cheese.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:49.080]   Hello doggie.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:49.920]   (dog barks)
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.360]   - There's a bed coming to you dog.
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.200]   - Yeah.
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:53.160]   - Ooh.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:54.000]   What is that?
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.900]   Wuffled spaghetti pie.
[01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:56.960]   - Oh my God.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:00.020]   This is gonna kill you.
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:01.040]   - Yeah some of these are not not great for you.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.320]   There's waffled crab cakes.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.480]   I'm still searching for the mac and cheese.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:06.680]   It could take me a minute.
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:08.360]   - That's okay, I don't wanna see it.
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:09.200]   It's depressing.
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.040]   - There's pizza.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.960]   - Soft food I can't eat.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.840]   - Oh there's pierogis, waffle pierogis.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:14.920]   - Perogis.
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:15.880]   - Starch.
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:17.360]   Starch it up.
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:18.360]   Waffle mac and cheese.
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.280]   - I used to be a deli.
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:21.760]   It crosses through from the radio station.
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:24.280]   It was called the full belly deli.
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:26.280]   And they made pierogis.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.720]   It was so good, greasy.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:28.560]   Oh that looks good.
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:29.400]   - Ooh.
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:30.240]   - That looks good.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:31.080]   - 'Cause I like mac and cheese
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:31.920]   to be really brown.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:32.920]   - What the crispy crust.
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:33.760]   - Yeah.
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:34.960]   - And I think oh next to it,
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:36.600]   you can't really tell in the picture.
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.400]   Well you can, I don't know if you can see,
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.280]   those are actually the waffled kale chips next to it.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:42.280]   You can see the little engine.
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:43.120]   - That's way too fast.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:43.960]   - I could eat that.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:44.800]   - That is going too far now.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.080]   (laughing)
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.440]   Waffled kale chips, come on.
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.560]   - Ew, you're gonna waffle a soft-shell crab,
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.040]   you might as well be your veggies.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.720]   - Let's go for it.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.120]   Number of the week from Jeff Jarvis.
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.200]   - I lost one of them so I can't find my complete--
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:02.200]   - Got all I said it on the waffles.
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:03.720]   - I'll do the boring one.
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.520]   - Yeah, this is, I can't follow this act.
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.840]   This is not fair.
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:07.680]   - Wow.
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:12.680]   - So yeah, so the Google stock has gone up 1,700% since it's IPO.
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:16.880]   However, of course it's not first.
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.880]   Apple, price line is up 69% Apple 4600%.
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:24.440]   - Wow.
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:25.600]   - That's like it's 4,100%.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:29.400]   Salesforce, 2,500%.
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:30.560]   - Wow.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:33.480]   - Amazon beats it 1,829%.
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:34.320]   So that's all.
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.520]   Not bad.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:37.480]   When did they go public?
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:38.880]   What's the date on that?
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:39.800]   - Well, what is the date?
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:41.480]   You should know that.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:43.880]   - August, August 19th, 2004.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:44.960]   It's been a long time.
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:45.800]   - Yeah, it has.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:46.960]   12 years.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:48.160]   - Exactly 12 years.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:54.840]   My pick of the week is kind of a little weird thing
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:57.480]   called Cube Composer.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.680]   It's a game, but it's a game that will teach you
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:04.920]   functional programming through transformations.
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:07.120]   All right, I mean, I know this is crazy,
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:11.920]   but how would you turn this red and yellow stack of cubes into?
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.160]   - Oh, this is so bad at spatial relations.
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:17.080]   - Well, but you're gonna learn, you're gonna learn.
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:19.320]   So you just map the yellow to the red, right?
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.640]   We'll drop that function over there.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:22.160]   Oh yeah, that worked.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:23.880]   So let's go to the next level.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:25.640]   Now you might say, well, this is pretty obvious.
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.800]   Oh, how do we get that to be all yellow?
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:29.960]   But what you're actually gonna do
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:34.960]   is you're gonna learn functional programming techniques.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:39.320]   And by the way, there's a lot in here.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:43.920]   There's a lot in here, including don't panic.
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:45.400]   This is the last level.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:50.040]   Really cool idea, absolutely free.
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:52.160]   I'm a fan of functional programming,
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.680]   and but one of the hardest things to teach people
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:57.800]   in functional programming are lambdas and mapping
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:59.920]   and some kind of sophisticated,
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.800]   kind of almost mathematical set theory stuff
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.480]   that is, if you're not a mathematician a little tricky,
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.000]   this does it in a kind of a time honored way,
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.760]   non-verbally just gives you a puzzle that you solve,
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:15.280]   and by the end of it, you'll kind of understand
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.340]   what mapping is.
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:19.040]   Anyway, I just thought I'd pass along.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.760]   I found out the other day I thought that was pretty cool.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.920]   - That is cool, I'm gonna play with that,
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:26.200]   'cause I've been really getting into functional programming,
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:29.000]   not actually writing about it, writing about it,
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.640]   because IOT, it's useful there.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:34.320]   - Now I really like you.
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:36.560]   - I don't program, I don't program.
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.920]   - You and I, we should get together
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:40.740]   and have a LISP partner programming session.
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:44.600]   - No, no, I was like, I can tell you what LISP is.
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:48.240]   - Get your Emacs fired up, we're gonna do it.
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:52.160]   That's the weirdest thing I ever heard about, by the way,
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.360]   programmers, partner programming, it's all a rage,
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:55.400]   I don't get it myself.
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:57.200]   It seems like the kind of thing you'd wanna do by yourself,
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.800]   but apparently they're--
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:00.440]   - I would think colonoscopies are the type of thing
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:01.280]   you do by yourself.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.600]   - Yeah, partner colonoscopies are all the rage
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:05.880]   in Hollywood now, everybody's doing it.
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:10.800]   Stacy Higginbotham, you'll find her at stacyoniot.com.
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:12.680]   That's her podcast and her blog,
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:14.600]   and you can subscribe to her newsletter there.
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:17.860]   She does a great show with Kevin Tofel,
[01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:20.360]   and it's next, it's tomorrow.
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:22.520]   - It comes out tomorrow, yes.
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:24.440]   We actually recorded it this morning.
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:25.520]   But it has to be added.
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.760]   Do you edit it or do you outsource that?
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:31.200]   - I edit some of it, and then I outsource
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:32.240]   the mushing together.
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:33.480]   - The mushing.
[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:34.200]   - Yeah. - The mushing.
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:35.000]   - The mushing.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.600]   Well, you must listen, 'cause first of all,
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:40.040]   Stacy and Kevin-- - Stacy knows.
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:41.040]   - What more do I have to say?
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.720]   I mean, that's a great pair, but--
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.360]   - We have a great show tomorrow.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.520]   - Yeah, oh. - Kevin's looking
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:46.840]   at connected jewelry.
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:48.560]   (laughing)
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:49.380]   - Good for him.
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:51.920]   Thank you, Stacy, always great to see you.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:53.560]   We'll see you next week.
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:57.000]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, when are you going to Europe?
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.320]   - Oh, you'll see me next week.
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:01.320]   It's the week of September 11th, and I'm in Europe.
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.160]   - Okay.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:04.520]   Yeah, I'm leaving shortly after that.
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:07.120]   I'm leaving a few days after you get back.
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.640]   Or no, I'm leaving September 16th.
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:12.040]   - That is the day after I get back?
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:12.960]   - Yeah.
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:14.560]   Well, good, you can take over when I'm gone,
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.400]   and vice versa.
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.240]   Jeff Jarvis is professor of journalism
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:20.040]   at the City University of New York.
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:22.560]   He also blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:24.120]   He is a legend.
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:26.040]   A legend.
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:28.200]   Are you still using the Google+,?
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:30.120]   - No.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:32.280]   No, and the worst of the Twitter,
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:35.560]   when I unleashed the dogs of Trump this week on Twitter,
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:37.320]   somebody came in and just said,
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:39.800]   I miss Google+, I miss the good old days on Google+,
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:40.640]   - I do too.
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:42.400]   - And I said, yeah, all 10 of them.
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:44.000]   (laughing)
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.760]   - We should change your lower third then.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:47.360]   Would you like us to have the--
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:48.200]   - Oh, that's right, it's there.
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:49.040]   No, it's there.
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:52.360]   - Would you like, well, we all used to be Google+,ers.
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:54.320]   Would you like to be at Jeff Jarvis?
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:55.400]   - I guess so.
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:57.600]   - Plus Facebook.com/JeffJARVIS.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:58.440]   - Yeah.
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:00.160]   - Kind of over social networks.
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:03.320]   I just, I don't see that they add,
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.720]   enhance my life in any way.
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.600]   I don't know what to do.
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:07.600]   - Oh, that's too sad.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:09.440]   - Wait, no, no, we're ending the show.
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:11.360]   We can't argue about Twitter again, no.
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:12.200]   - No.
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:13.520]   (laughing)
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.040]   - We managed to get through a whole show
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:17.240]   without even saying the T word.
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:18.320]   - Like, don't do it, y'all.
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:19.160]   - Ah!
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:21.280]   Ah!
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.840]   - We do, this week in Google,
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:24.880]   every Wednesday, 130 Pacific,
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:27.840]   430 Eastern, 2030 UTC.
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:30.280]   Those are rough times, approximate times.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:33.440]   - Yes, people do not give Leo any help
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:34.280]   for these not- - You're not watching
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:35.120]   a television channel.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.240]   - This ain't channel eight.
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:38.600]   - Who wants television networks?
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.480]   Television networks are so,
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.120]   who wants to be programmed like that?
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:44.680]   - I'll tell you what, I guarantee if you tune in at that time,
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:46.800]   there will be something going on,
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:47.960]   something fun to watch.
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:49.720]   Often the stuff that's happening before the show
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:51.520]   begins is better than the show.
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.880]   - We even use bad words then.
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:54.080]   - Yeah.
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.200]   - You get to see the real Jeff and Leo.
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:58.460]   (grunting)
[01:53:58.460 --> 01:54:01.640]   But if you prefer the sausage,
[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:03.320]   over the seeing the sausage being made,
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:05.600]   you can get the podcast direct
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:08.540]   and listen exactly on the dot,
[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:11.400]   at twit.tv/twink.
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:14.120]   - If you want to see the sausage or the extrusion.
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:17.320]   - Yeah, you don't want to see the whole extrusion thing.
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:18.640]   I'll tell you what. - I'll tell you what.
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:23.640]   - I actually have been to several sausage making workshops.
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:25.800]   And it is an un-
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:26.640]   - You're out?
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:27.640]   - Yeah.
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:29.440]   I have friends who do sausage making,
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:30.280]   and we made,
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:32.040]   I'll show you the pictures sometime.
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:34.520]   Lots of meat.
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:36.040]   And then you push it,
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:38.640]   and it's actually kind of disgusting.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.480]   - It is.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:40.320]   - Yes.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:42.080]   - That's why that phrase exists.
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:42.920]   - Yeah.
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:43.840]   You don't want to watch the sausage.
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:44.680]   - My early gadget,
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:46.200]   like when I was a columnist on the examiner,
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:49.240]   I used to love to go to the Old Civic Center
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:51.120]   when the former Moscone was built.
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:53.280]   And I'd go to trade shows in various fields.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:58.280]   My favorite was the food industry equipment trade show.
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.360]   And there were gigantic extruders.
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:01.200]   - Oh.
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:02.040]   - My favorite thing.
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:05.160]   - Yeah.
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:07.600]   - I can tell you the favorite thing to watch is a GIF,
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.400]   not a food extruder, extruders,
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:11.840]   but it's called FarmBot.
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:14.120]   If you get bored, guys go look at the FarmBot GIF,
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.040]   'cause it's adorable.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:16.800]   - It's a CNC.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:20.160]   CNC planting machine.
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:22.680]   And you program it and it like just starts dropping seeds
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:23.520]   everywhere.
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:24.360]   - Nice.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:25.200]   - So food it's early stage.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:26.760]   - FarmBot.
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:28.960]   Oh yeah, we watched that some, we've seen that.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:30.520]   Yeah, we've watched that on the show before.
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:31.360]   - Oh yeah.
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:32.200]   - Yeah.
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:33.040]   - We love the FarmBot.
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:33.880]   - It's hypnotic.
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:34.720]   I love that thing.
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:35.560]   - Yeah.
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:36.800]   Yeah, that's really cool.
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:39.280]   That's better than the sausage being made.
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:40.120]   - Yeah.
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:45.120]   - I guess that's all I have to say.
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:45.960]   It's time to say goodbye.
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:46.800]   - It's time to say goodbye.
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:49.320]   I don't want to say goodbye, but I will say goodbye.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:50.160]   - I'm gonna.
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:51.120]   - I will see you guys next week.
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.240]   - Next week, thank you Stacey.
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:53.080]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:54.400]   Thanks to all of you for joining us.
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.520]   We will see you right here next week on This Week in Koopa.
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:55:59.360]   Bye bye.
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:01.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:04.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:07.100]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.100]   (music fades)
