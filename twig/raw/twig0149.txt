[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.720]   Thanks for joining us and of course as long as I'm holding up books. Let's hold up Jeff Jarvis's book public parts
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.680]   Jeff is of course a professor of journalism at the City University of New York and
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.880]   The author of number of books including what would Google do in this new one public?
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.040]   parts and I'm gonna blame my 10 pounds of added weight on information
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.240]   That's it
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   I
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:42.640]   Jokes you get you poor guy. He's made to already and we just started
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:50.040]   I'm in I'm in for a long haul. He's from Washington DC. I want low-protein information
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.360]   I'm all about cutting information carbs. No more processed information for me
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.400]   Hey top story isn't really a big top story for
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.520]   For normal, but because we were big friends friends and fans of Kevin Rose
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.480]   We now know what he's doing at the Google. It was kind of a mystery Kevin
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.040]   Who found a dig he was?
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.720]   Actually an IT guy at tech TV when he discovered a major bug in windows and we put him on the air on the screen savers
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.080]   He became the dark tipper and later took over my job
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.480]   Thanks Kevin and then
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.920]   And then was a regular on Twitter for three weeks and decided to found
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.680]   dignity thanks Kevin
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.760]   Kevin and I are old buddies good friends and certainly not rivals in any respect
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.760]   He's done pretty well for himself in fact. He was on business week is a $60 million man
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.520]   He then oh well. Oh well
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.200]   He's come easy come maybe not I don't know it might be if you look at the investments he's made
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.440]   He he of course a founded revision three founded dig left
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.200]   Both companies to start milk MI dot LK which was a kind of an app incubator
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.960]   his plan at milk was to
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.720]   Fail fast to keep creating product products and fail fast until you found a hit he made one
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.320]   Cancel the product and sold to Google
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.800]   And now we know what he's doing because he wouldn't tell anybody
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.880]   Turns out he's a partner at Google's investment arm Google ventures. I
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.720]   Don't think that's actually what he
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.360]   plans to do somehow, but maybe it sounded like he was working in products
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.760]   But this makes sense you would I could see you would leave frankly
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.680]   I could see why you would leave your own career as an entrepreneur if you could support entrepreneurs
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.480]   And he's always been like a an angel investor. Listen to the companies that he's invested in and you might think he's probably is the
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.000]   $60 million man fab four square Ng moco
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160]   OMG pop
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.480]   path square Twitter and Zinga
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.800]   Not bad not bad. I would hire him as an adventure partner
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.000]   He was apparently originally a senior product product manager at Google Plus
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.800]   according to Liz Gaines writing in all things D and then and then the rest of his team joined the social team
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.120]   The milk deal according to Liz was worth $12 million up front with $3 million potential earn out according to a source
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.280]   Evolved in the deal, but now he's at Google ventures
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:34.360]   Which has good people Rick Klaus there love Rick's a great guy's wonderful. Yeah, Rick Rick Rick started feed burner
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.480]   Yes, which was acquired by Google and that's how Rick got in the got in the game the same way Kevin is right
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.080]   Yeah, I met Rick on the Dean campaign in 2004. He worked with the Dean campaign. Oh, yeah
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.720]   He sure did we should mention clay was responsible for Dean's digital strategy, right?
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.760]   I was a software developer versus lead programmer. There were other people that were
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:03.800]   Doing what we called on the Dean campaign strategy, but it was really throwing noodles on a wall and seeing which one stuck
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.320]   It's kind of interesting that a presidential campaign needs a programmer
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.400]   But I think that that's probably that's not a good thing. Did you work with Zach Rosen?
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.320]   Yeah, Zach was in my cube. Did you write Mitt Romney's iPhone app?
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   I know how to spell
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.160]   Did you see this?
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.240]   That would be a great way to sabotage them. You should take credit
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:31.640]   At firstly, it's actually appropriately spelled. It's just Latin. It's America CIA. It means love the CIA and it's a
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.600]   photo-taking app
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.560]   That sends your face to the central intelligence agency
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.480]   I have to say at first I was a little puzzled because I was seeing on Instagram all these people
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.720]   Saying I'm mitt for America. I'm a mitt rom, you know, and I thought that this is kind of odd
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.280]   Why are all these people suddenly coming out as Romney supporters?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.080]   And then I realized what the problem was it was misspelled. This is a Romney app
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.040]   They put out for the iPhone. It was an app that would take your photos and admit Romney
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.520]   slogans
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.520]   boy, uh to your pictures
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.040]   including
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.600]   One that was misspelled
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.200]   And what it should do is take your picture and make it look like an etch a sketch did it
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:24.160]   And what's interesting is it's going to take them a while to recoil from that too because they got to probably issue a bug fix and go through the app store process
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.920]   Apple has to approve it. How did it get past? Is this apples the company?
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.160]   I don't understand how it got past Apple. This is the company where they they were complaining about colors and icons
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.840]   But they allow am erc
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.240]   Ia
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.520]   Immersia. They're big fans of supporters of Immersia. Immersia
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   Holy cow
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.480]   That was just that's of the copy editor. That's how I was supposed to as a journalist
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.440]   I was supposed to insert here how the world was falling apart with no copy editors
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.360]   Well, you know there is a greatest country on our there are times when you uh
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.000]   Do wish you had a copy editor
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.320]   You're right now. They have to now they have to wait
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.640]   um
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.360]   For uh, and I this could take weeks
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.280]   You can ask apple for special consideration like you can you can it's an emergency
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.680]   Yeah, you can say it's an emergency bug
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.200]   I don't know if apple would consider this emergency an emergency bug it'll be interesting to see how long it takes to get fixed
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.680]   I gotta download it right now before it gets fixed
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.320]   Get it and never update it. It's called with mitt
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.600]   Which by the way is not the most propitious name to begin with
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.400]   I'm mitt mitt in German. That would be mitt mitts, right? It's mitt
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.800]   mitt mitt
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.600]   So there you go. He has a programmer. Is that the kind of thing you're doing for how we're dean? I
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.600]   I suspect that that was probably uh
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.800]   outsourced it
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.600]   Outsource to type a or somewhere
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.200]   right
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.240]   Maybe maybe mitt you should use american-made programs
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.920]   A better americia although you're right it is kind of a Freudian slip
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.600]   mmm
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   CIA
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.680]   Hmm
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.920]   I'm downloading it right now. I'm gonna take a picture of myself
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.200]   Get started
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.200]   Okay
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   Choose a mitt message
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.680]   Take a photo share with friends
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.120]   Uh, that's one that's america's spelled properly believe in america
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:31.600]   Mitt 2012 day one job one. I believe i'm with mitt. I'm a mom for mitt
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.960]   Oh, what a hokem. Obama isn't working. I stand with mitt the america. We love no they change it
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:44.000]   Oh, that's no. No, it's it's a better america. Let me see what's a better america. Yeah, believe in america
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.760]   Maybe they did fix it already. Oh dang. I think they fixed it. Oh
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.720]   That pisses me off
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.360]   How dare they fix it
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.600]   Before I could download it
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.640]   So is it you think it's common that uh, what when when howard dean did it?
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.520]   I mean he was famous to be like the first internet candidate
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:12.160]   Uh, he raised all this money from the internet. I mean it was really a big deal. Was he do you think the first candidate to have a staff programmer?
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.280]   Yeah, I was I was the first programmer. I think a real programmer hired by a presidential campaign to my knowledge
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.880]   That's amazing. Um, that was in 2004. That's eight years ago. Yep
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.680]   Uh, would you guess that they all have programmers and writing apps right now?
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.720]   They'll have some form of digital staff they either, um, use
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.320]   I mean the both both romney and
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.000]   Obama have a campaign staff that is is digital that I saw on
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.080]   Somebody told me this is totally offhand, but somebody told me that
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.280]   Uh about half of the obama campaign staff is actually digital staff now
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.800]   Um, jeez well we talked about this on in your interview on triangulation. Um, I was
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:03.200]   You know, I was excited, uh, four years ago because obama really reached out to the internet and uh,
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.320]   You know was very active and I signed up. I gave him my text message number and stuff and then he got elected in
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.360]   Nothing it was like
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.880]   Yeah, but you know you explained it when you go to the white house. They're still running windows xp
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.200]   You can't have a twitter or a face. You can't use Skype. You can't use sky
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.480]   Yeah, it's it's every computer inside of the white house
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:34.160]   Uh, it's especially amongst their digital staff every desk has two computers on it one that um, the government gives them and that that
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.840]   Computer is used to, uh display a screensaver
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.560]   Uh, and then the computer that the employee brought from home that they used to do work on
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.320]   Wow
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.480]   That uh, are they allowed to get on the network with the home computer or they use in cell?
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:55.040]   It's uh, it's touch and go. Um, I you know, I haven't I haven't pressed too hard on that because I don't want
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.480]   It's it's like pulling the the jinga piece out of the puzzle there good puzzle thing to collapse
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.400]   Um, but uh, they they just announced some really interesting things. Uh, this week they have the sort of
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.160]   Digital initiative that uh, Todd park, uh released
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.840]   And one thing in it which I think is really interesting is this e they call it an easy rfp program
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.920]   And they're basically trying to reinvent
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:25.200]   What's called small acquisitions acquisitions under 150 thousand dollars to say can we make those happen faster?
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.920]   Better cheaper without companies having to go through the kind of rigamarole
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.680]   um
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:38.080]   That uh, that they normally do and what they're doing is they're trying to find a program manager and two software developers to actually come in
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.120]   And be uh, white house fellows to uh, to sort of revamp that process
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.160]   So I think that's really a really cool step and that's amongst a whole slew of other projects that they announced
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.760]   Uh, along those those lines to sort of have a
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.200]   Larger innovation program inside of the white house. It's a good thing
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.320]   But but uh, leo I think you know back to your point
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.880]   You're you're right that that if you use that you have this whole relationship with people out there
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.080]   You you push that and then you get into office and you don't continue it
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.680]   It kind of gives lie to the notion that it's a relationship in the campaign
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.560]   I asked
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:17.520]   Cameron's video guy in the uk some years ago whether he would continue doing videos because he web camera and was really pretty good
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.000]   He's washing the dishes on video. We had all kinds of things
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.440]   And and the guys said well if he didn't continue to do it, it would be cynical we're doing now, right
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.080]   So it would reveal that I think is rather cynical
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:35.840]   I mean, come get let's let's let's let's do some contrast here. I mean three years ago. There was no blog on white house.com
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.920]   Um three years ago. No federal agency had a twitter account
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.480]   Uh three years ago
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:49.600]   Um, uh government no government agency had a facebook page or very few had a facebook page
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.240]   You know these guys, uh, the we the people site, uh is is pretty amazing
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.680]   There's a petition on there now that's getting a whole bunch of traction saying
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.240]   Uh, it looks like the president's gonna have to respond saying
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.640]   um, we want uh
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.880]   Free access to taxpayer funded scientific research. That's a big deal
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:13.840]   Um, you know, there none of this existed three years ago. So I you know, I think that they're doing the best that they can
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.960]   I mean, obviously i'm biased but the
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.800]   The contrasting where we were three years ago to where we're at today. It's uh, pretty remarkable
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.360]   Yeah, I'll agree. Yes
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.080]   My favorite moment in campaigns was when Rudy Giuliani made his myspace page private
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:35.360]   I don't want you to know what i'm drinking
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.200]   I have to admit I knew campaign 2012 at launch when I started getting text messages again from president obama
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.760]   Because you know, it was death of silence for it's like a boy bad boyfriend or girlfriend
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.840]   Silence until he wanted me again
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.080]   There's there's rules right so it was like a booty call from the president
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:59.280]   So the president is not allowed to take his text messaging list into the white house
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.400]   And say like so that has to stay with the democratic national committee or the campaign or whatever this
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:10.320]   So there's all kinds of rules and regulations about the the assets of of everything that that make it a little bit trickier
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   So i'm the
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.480]   White House released a video about it was abama was was tweeting he was answering questions on twitter
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:24.000]   And one of his staff one of his uh staff at the white house was explaining to him what the perfect tweet was which was that
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.440]   You know, he had tweeted something that was exactly 140 characters and she was explaining that that's that's a twush
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.760]   You know to a twig a twee swoosh like playing basketball and he and he was laughing about it. I mean, well, that's good
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.760]   Incredible. He's kept finding you know, that was something we were all talking about in 2009
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.840]   But i'm glad he's caught up
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.200]   So twoosh does anybody even talk about twos? Anymore? Come on?
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.080]   Whoa, but you know, it's perfect 140 characters president. Mr. President
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.880]   POTUS did a twoosh
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:58.080]   He's the twoosh master. POTUS the twoosh master. He can also catch flies with his bare hands, but that's
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.160]   so um
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.960]   I I like the petition thing. I just wonder is now maybe i'm cynical, but I just feel like nobody's paying attention
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.200]   These here's a good one require this is a we petition the abama administration to
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:16.320]   Require this is from the chatroom require free access over the internet to scientific journal articles arising from taxpayer-funded research is
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:23.520]   scandalous how these scientific journals charge tons of money for access to publicly funded research
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.000]   and uh
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.920]   Provide no value for it. Yeah, I know value it's all there and already uh
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.600]   They're close to their 25,000 which is
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.760]   So when you get 25,000 then it's I don't know turns into a pumpkin
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.000]   I don't know when you get to 25,000 the the white house has to respond to it
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.880]   But but really clay
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.680]   They're gonna respond in one way or another. I did one
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:54.560]   Uh a while ago. I only got 5,000, but uh, it was um and more hate mail than i've ever gotten for anything that i've ever done
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.000]   What was your petition?
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.960]   Let me use my kindle during takeoff and landing. Yes
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.480]   Yes, well, yeah, that was a great one. Yes, by the way, that was wonderful. Yes. No, but I tried really
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.480]   Hard to get Alec Baldwin to join it on
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:12.800]   Op-ed in the USA today, but these people came after me and were like you're trying to kill us you're a terror
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.960]   Oh, come on the kindle come on
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.720]   um
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.400]   And it's like uh man. Yeah, people are really people are really afraid of that
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.080]   So well, we know now the people pay attention the question is does the white house
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.960]   And now come on clay. We talked about this in the interview
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.040]   I kind of gave you a softball in this one
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.400]   Because it's it was and when we talked last it was your opinion that the really the only upshot of these petitions is to gap
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.160]   email addresses
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.600]   Right, right, but the white that's for the most part
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.080]   But I haven't seen the white house actually do anything with these emails, right?
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.480]   So I've created a petition. I've signed a few
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.680]   I've never received an email other than sort of the verify your email address stuff from the white
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.000]   They're not allowed to right because that would be the campaign then that would use it and there's no you can still send
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.200]   You can still you know the white house still has a list and they can you know
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.160]   They can send out an email saying like check out the latest presidential weekly address or check out the
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.080]   I never get that stuff. I only get stuff saying
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.880]   Remember when you gave us money four years ago. That's from the campaign. Right. It's the campaign
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.520]   I guess stuff from the campaign. I never hear from anybody else
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.440]   Never got a twosh
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.560]   No twoshes for me
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.560]   but i'm not cynical and uh
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.720]   I'm just i'm just pointing it out. I mean I would
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.680]   you know
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.280]   I know I know he likes gay marriage, but I don't care. I think this is more important
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.520]   I know he's our first gay president, but I think this is okay
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.320]   He's being used
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.920]   Speaking of gay marriage, anybody can actually
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.120]   Sergei brin gently caress Gavin Newsom on television. I'm pissed. Okay. I'm pissed
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:55.280]   So so we've been trying to get anybody from google on this show, you know, but above matt cuts matt's matt's fun
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:01.040]   I love matt, but we'd like to get an executive like maybe sir gear Larry or you know somebody no nothing
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.040]   They don't even respond to us
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.800]   But Gavin Newsom on his current channel, which has four viewers
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.640]   Not only does he not only does he get sir gear
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:16.240]   He wears the glasses and gives Gavin a huge scoop because he's not a tech reporter and lets him wear the glasses
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.280]   And of course, I have a home. I have a homebrew version. I made myself. Yeah, let me see
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.160]   All right. Hold on
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   Very scared now
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:35.040]   He's got the phone taped it by the way. That's an original droid. I might add taped to his glasses
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:42.640]   My wife is uh is 37 weeks pregnant and she made me go see uh uh what to expect when you're expecting
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.240]   Oh dear. You needed that the movie half is good. Yeah half is jaylo half is bad. Yeah, which half
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:53.200]   Um
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:59.040]   Property here on i love it. You were prepared for that. This is the carrot top of information
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.240]   Neposse. I tell you
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.920]   Wow, i'm impressed
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.720]   So I don't even you know gah this is the problem is sir
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.160]   Gae's not going to come on a show like this because then if one of us wears these glasses
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.920]   We'll have something to say about it, but apparently he could sw- he swiped him
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.480]   Uh to scroll
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:24.080]   Apparently we don't know gentle caress of the temple gentle caress of the temple to scroll through the pictures
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.640]   And then the the supposition is the down swipe took the put the gallery away
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.920]   He apparently took a picture, but it's not clear how
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.360]   Like that wasn't clear and also I don't understand when he had the glasses over to nousam
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:45.120]   He was still manipulating the cursor pad. Yeah, he see what was on the screen. Yeah, it's been something as pocket clear
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.600]   So he it's not projecting. It's I think it's a it's a clear lcd screen
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:56.320]   So um he could probably see it on he could just probably see it in reverse on the other side. I guess we can watch a little bit of this
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:03.680]   It was just it was just the frame. Oh, yeah, this is from current tv the gavin nousam show gavin
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.200]   Look either way gavin. He's the lieutenant governor of california
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.680]   So i'm glad that not only is gavin scooping me
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.560]   But he's getting paid by the state to do it
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.080]   He he is really good on up all night with with uh chrisina apple gate
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.840]   By the way, he's got a lot of personality. I've always liked i've always liked yavin nousam. Are we not getting all the oneness?
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.440]   Doesn't he look like joe from arrest of development? He does. Oh, I get it. That was the joke
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.120]   I thought he actually did work on arrested development picture of you and and you're making actually eye contact with me in the picture
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.360]   You know if i'd whipped out a phone
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.840]   You know like this and on this like it would have been very different. Yeah. Well, how do I know you're not making that up
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.840]   What has a little email to you after so you're able to mean so literally you're able to see the image you just photographed
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.320]   Right back on it. What does it reflects on the?
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:56.640]   Let's take a look. So this is the first non google executive to ever wear the glasses
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.800]   You don't have to push it. Somebody says the trade record
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.560]   No, no, no, no
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:07.280]   There was a prop google glasses they had at the g plus c conference that everybody was wearing including tray. I believe those are props
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.160]   These are actually working ones. There it is
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.120]   Or so says gavin newson if we can believe them
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.760]   Fascinating here. That's me
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.000]   See that and you zoom right in. Yeah, amazing. Yeah
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.640]   So this is I mean, so this is something you guys have been working on at google for how long
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.720]   Yeah, now he's gonna ask the hard questions. So
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.000]   Thank you gavin newson for nothing
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.040]   Sergey, I challenge you
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.640]   Come on this show and show us the glasses. Let me wear the glasses
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.920]   Just for five minutes. Was it an android operating system?
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.360]   Uh, you know, he I guess he didn't get to control it
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.360]   Um
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.840]   I don't know if you want to borrow my uh, my home brew
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.920]   You know
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.040]   I'm the I am the talk of the town walking in downtown dc with
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.160]   I bet you like my do project x glasses
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.560]   I've never used to an airport information diet x uh labs
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.520]   Um, no, I'm trying to really see the future
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:14.560]   Uh, maybe we'll you know what this is the hope we're going to google. I. Oh, when is that next month jina
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.880]   Yeah in a couple weeks seven all right. Yeah, the 27th will be in the next month
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.400]   I'm still hoping they'll be under our chair

[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.200]   Yeah, it sounds like we're gonna get a chocolate nothing
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.000]   Uh, actually I think i'm supposed to stay here. I think they're making me stay here
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.400]   Really? Yeah, and jeff you're not going after all. I can't family all thing. I'll explain. That's quite all right
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.480]   um
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:50.160]   And uh, I think jason howl's going from our uh tnt show and all about android of course
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.960]   so
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.960]   Will you bring my tablet back
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.000]   Next is tablet pops up on the benchmark site
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.280]   uh according to android police the tablet named nexus seven
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.040]   Looks to be a quad core tegra three
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.080]   Seven inch
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:17.840]   Much like the uh asus i believe is it the asus that they're saying it's the same base i think it was i think that was
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:23.440]   It was as a basis to help build it says manufactured in the um in the device. It says manufactured by asus
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:31.200]   Um seven inch 12 80 by 768. That's a nice resolution for seven inches with the next os
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   Yep quad core a nine
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.640]   Talk clocked at 1.3 gigahertz
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.760]   uh in vidia ula g force gpu
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.520]   android 4.1 j
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.680]   That's the jelly bean
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.920]   peanut butter jelly time
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:55.440]   Uh, which actually be interesting. Maybe it's not 5.0. It's 4.1
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.640]   Not that that matters. What does that matter? Why do we even care?
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.200]   Price at $200
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.840]   That's what's important. That's what's important. Now. That's what the journals said in march
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:11.440]   I'm taping that sucker to the other side of the glasses. Yeah, there you go
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.200]   Seven inches is just about right to hide jaylo's butt
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.800]   I'm sorry. God. I can't believe I went there
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.200]   Is she actually expecting or is that just the name of the movie?
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:29.120]   Uh, that is the name of the movie. Okay, but my wife is expecting
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.600]   June 19th is a due date any day now. Oh, that's great. And you've read the actual book
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.840]   No, I don't know how to read. Oh, that's a great thing in that up. I don't know how to write
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.720]   That's how you go on an information diet
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   illiteracy sure
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:50.080]   Uh, no every every future parent you read that jeff right when oh, yeah, oh god. Yeah, what to expect when you're expecting
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.240]   I don't know how they make a movie out of that. It's you know, only do it for the first kid though, right
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.880]   second kid is like
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.480]   It's not somebody tell me change a good diaper. Not exactly a steep learning curve
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.520]   Or maybe not a shallow learning curve. I guess it would it would be a quick
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.280]   Sources speaking to techno buffalo
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.200]   Which is apparently a blog of some sort
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:21.360]   Indicated the tablet would be made by a sus. This is coming from casey johnston writing in arse technica
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.680]   Would be priced at $200 and would be announced at google i.o
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.920]   Didn't they give us a galaxy tab last year 10.1
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.720]   Yep, they did it was a special
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.480]   I know addition though. It was the one that that that that that you know bricks every three months like as a feature
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.120]   I gave that to a visitor the other day
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:50.560]   We're gonna it looks like we'll get the uh hardware samples of the new device. So we'll get the early
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.120]   The ones at brick. Yeah
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:28:01.040]   Right now you're a developer deal with it. Yeah, I'll say I mean the whole point is that they want developers to start making and their android apps
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:07.680]   Uh tablet size for people for people who say hey, you know, you guys are getting free stuff. It's not good free stuff
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:14.880]   It's it's kind of wonky free stuff. It's for developers the day that it happens though
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:20.800]   Everyone can feel the jealousy on the internet. Just I never got that 4g my fight card to work ever
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.000]   Did you really yeah, it might work for a little while I'd expire, you know, it was only a few months
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.320]   Maybe that's why I never I didn't use it then it expired
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:35.040]   I'm still getting bills from sprint from my uh evo 4g. I got two years ago even though i haven't used it in six months
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.880]   Well, that's another thing is if you get a phone and now do you think they'll be a phone?
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:45.280]   I don't think so. No, I don't know this tablet is more than enough. Yeah
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:53.760]   It's going out as the soon as the uh that sam sung uh, what's it called three the uh, why am I blanking on that?
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.840]   three
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.640]   Oh the galaxy has three at that's it came out today the galaxy
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.000]   Yes, it came out today, but it's in such limited supply because they got so many pre-orders
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.880]   That it is very difficult to get I got an email because I ordered one from expanseus
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.560]   Which is uh has they have their fingers in the pie in britain and they said they hope that they can get us
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.320]   Get it out to us sometime soon june 20th. It's believed
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   Will be the ship date in the uh
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:26.480]   What carrios i believe is at and tt mobile is at at and t mobile uh Jason for the galaxy s3 at and t mobile
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.640]   All about and I don't have a lilon to ask anymore. I have to ask Jason. Yeah
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.400]   At and t and t mobile certainly team definitely t mobile
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.440]   So this team soul I went to the techno mart which is floors of these
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.640]   Ooh selling stuff. Yeah, it's the second largest one and I thought I was going to buy a note
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.720]   They were much more expensive there than they are here. Yeah, somebody uh, uh, uh,
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.480]   Our it guy russell taman. He was in japan and he said I didn't buy anything because it was more expensive because the dollar is so weak
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:00.720]   The reason sam sung has is having trouble getting s threes into people's hands today is
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.840]   Apparently there was a problem with pebble blue
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:09.760]   Phone comes in two colors white and pebble blue and the battery cover of the pebble blue didn't match
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.960]   I'll take a second. I don't you know you found that out today
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.360]   That's like they opened the boxes and said oh these don't match send them back
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:24.400]   I don't that doesn't I don't get it now available in the uk france
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:30.720]   Dubai souti arabia and uh some other countries in europe middle east and africa
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.480]   By july 145 countries 296 service providers
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.240]   They already have pre-orders of nine million. It is widely agreed. This will be the most successful non-i phone ever
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.960]   The features do look pretty good. I was dubious
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.320]   But when I went through the sam sung site through the list of features
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.440]   Yeah, uh, screen after screen. It's pretty good and they have a new pen. It's not the s pen as it is in the galaxy note
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.360]   It's now the seepen. I think see what letter do they pick see
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.880]   Um, it's got a good good size screen
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.280]   Pentile
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.760]   Which i'm not crazy about it has its theory
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.360]   It does it comes with a sam sung version of syri
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.560]   It comes with a lot of those kind of interesting
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:20.160]   Customizations it knows whether you're asleep. Uh if you're chas when you're sleeping or here
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.520]   It knows when you're awake. It knows when you've been bad or good
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:30.080]   And sam sung is launching a new music store to compete with itunes the music hub
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.680]   That's what the world needs 19 million tunes
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:41.600]   Yes, we don't have enough other music store. Oh boy. The music hub is based on technology from
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.160]   M spot, which sam sung just acquired
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:50.160]   Users can store as well as buy it's very you know, it's one of those things like itunes match where
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.640]   If they don't have the song you can upload it
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.760]   Uh, but they do have a lot of songs
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:01.520]   It's very much like itunes match that it will scan and match the music but not upload it if they have it
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.920]   um
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.400]   Nine power nine euros and 99. What is it pennies? What is a mini euro?
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:13.120]   9.99 euros per month
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.680]   It could sense
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.680]   Is it sense? Yeah, it's sense
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.440]   Euro says euro nerd in our chat room says euro sent
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:29.200]   Music stores are so 2008. I want app stores new app stores are the thing today. Yeah. Oh, that's so
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.120]   2012
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.520]   Yeah, we'll send a book stores online
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.880]   You know, you know
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.520]   Man too much
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:48.160]   Say I think the new apple the new apple refrigerator the i fridge is going to be huge
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.960]   Uh, let's start the rumor right now. He did say I think he did say he's not going to do a toaster
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.360]   We've got some actual new tim cook said that
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.120]   I think so. Yes
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.480]   We're gonna get to we're gonna get to that all things d interview last night because that boy
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.400]   That was the top story of the year frankly. I mean this was like not for me
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.120]   But just like the the tech journalists went crazy on that
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:12.320]   Um, it's it's this big coming out right like it says it is it is apparently he held his own
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.920]   Um
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.880]   TJ kang senior vice president of sam san electronics media solution center says
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.640]   With the new music hub we're bringing the joy back to music
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.520]   Thank you sam san
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.080]   It's a cause i'm getting enough joy with my music
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.560]   I'm gonna say my music acquisition has been joyless for so long
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.840]   Oh my god
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.840]   Is swooping in here to help out
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.880]   That's not too egotistical. We're bringing the joy back
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:44.240]   And they say we're going to put the music hub in everything we make including the refrigerator
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:51.040]   I'm bringing the ecstasy back to books with the information that just FYI
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.960]   Information x
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.400]   Just you know hydrator die. That's all I could say
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.840]   Uh, they are going to have a scan and match cloud locker
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.920]   100 gigs of storage for unmatched songs. That's a good amount
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:14.720]   19 million songs is as big as any of them I think they are going to do radio pandora style radio
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:20.080]   They have a recommendation engine that is every bit as good as the apple genius
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.880]   I'm glad they're aiming high
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.120]   Optimized for mobile
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.040]   Web player so they didn't have to make this a smart idea. They didn't have to make
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.240]   Desktop apps. They just you just opened the website
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.840]   But you have to have a galaxy s3 phone
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:44.320]   Oh, also there's flip board for android and the first appearance of flip board for android will be on the s3 as well
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:50.960]   So why they've been so I mean they make a big deal of being slow and doing it right
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.280]   Flipboard is one of the I I I haven't used it in a year
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.200]   Oh, I use it every day, but you don't use an iPad to use an iPad
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.560]   Yeah, I do know
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.080]   It's kind of how I browse my news and you know, they've added audio now, which is kind of cool
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.640]   You can listen to a fresh air while you're browsing
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.840]   Yeah
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.040]   So I got the the new Logitech keyboard for the
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:20.240]   The iPad. Oh, did you get that isn't that nice the ultra thin cover? It's nice. It's one thing right so it's it's
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.520]   We're all buying those Jeff everybody's flipped over those it has the magnet, right?
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.760]   God
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.760]   You need to tape that to your glasses, I think
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:37.200]   It's just the right size
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:43.440]   Hey, that looks really cool. Thank you. Hey Jeff. You're muted your mic the falling iPad muted you
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:49.360]   No, he broke his mic. Okay. Oh good. Oh, yeah
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.520]   Right, so it has a magnet in this
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:59.040]   It's supposed to be a little bit bigger. It's a Logitech sponsorship
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.760]   Everything
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.760]   There we go. I'm gonna rebox this
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:12.000]   So you could pick it up like this, which is just nice the problem is it's so there it is closed, right?
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   And now what I want to do. I want to use this iPad. I want to do like this
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.720]   That it just goes slippery slidey
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.680]   It doesn't doesn't go away
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.800]   That was a really great pipe in ball. Well, you certainly demonstrated the slippery slidey part
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:31.440]   Next time
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.560]   Now i'm not gonna say anything so I got an email from uh,
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:39.520]   Expansis, which is the British company that I ordered the the galaxy s3c now
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.480]   I've said all those things you realize now I have to have a galaxy s3
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.680]   Because I have to demonstrate all of this stuff on the show, right?
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.480]   Right, that's for IRS purposes
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:54.480]   As you may already know Samsung has delayed the launch of their highly anticipated galaxy s3 as Samsung has stated there was a
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:01.040]   Manufacturing issue on the blue units where the battery door color did not match the color of the device itself as a result
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.320]   There are only a very small number of white devices
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:11.760]   Being allocated to retailers in Europe with us allocations to follow what is your order white blue or white white
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.880]   Thank god. I had the good sense
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.360]   Not to order the pebble blue because the pebble blue just looked like gray to me
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.920]   Yeah, the white looks nice white look, you know, i'm doing all white now my cat this year
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.320]   Year of 2012 white is the new black
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:32.400]   Oh my god, and then i'll know i'm gonna have a different color every year. So, oh, that was this 2012 pile
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:39.280]   So I wonder what the ui is gonna be like with the samsung hub
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   Uh
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.120]   I have touch with the player. Oh, I don't that's a good question
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.520]   You mean like for the music hub. Yeah, I don't know yeah like as the you know when you want to buy a song
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:55.360]   Is it setups that you immediately go to the samsung site? That's a good quummy look on the note. That's a good question
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.680]   I guess it must be
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.520]   Right. They say it works fine with i-tunes
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.960]   I have because I have uh the galaxy note with 4.0 and touch was for
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.520]   I have the samsung music app. They call it a music hub in fact
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.240]   So let me just see if uh
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.120]   Oh, wow, it looks like uh looks like i've got a new user agreement. Maybe I am getting the special
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:21.360]   And um top tracks new releases. Yeah, this is a store
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.400]   Seven digital. This is it
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.720]   So I guess they turned it on
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.160]   So, um, what should I buy the new garbage album? I think so
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.480]   I I feel such joy
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:38.000]   Such such joy for me. My joy has come back a dollage a lot of joy when you have to enter your credit card number
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.080]   I mean, do they have your payment details?
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.000]   Uh, let's buy it's $5 to buy not your kind of people not
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.800]   S-oh, you have to have an samsung account
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.600]   Oh, jeez. You have to have a samsung account
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.280]   So take it off of me because I think I made a samsung account
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.800]   But I don't want anybody to know that my secret password is string cheese
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.280]   So it's basically gonna be what amazon does
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.320]   Yeah, replace the store with their store. Yeah, just what I need another store
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.440]   But you know, um
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:16.320]   What what I didn't say is what the format is I presume it's mp3 is it a ac? I don't know
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.400]   And
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.400]   I presume it will work
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:28.160]   With the uh, they said it'll work with amazon music and all that stuff. Let me see if I got the right password
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.160]   I don't I've never used my samsung account
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.720]   Nope
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.280]   Well, I'll have to try to remember what that was now
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:42.000]   But yeah, that looks like so there you go. So you don't have to have a uh, it's it's it's it's here now
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.080]   Do you does anybody have a uh, official samsung?
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:53.200]   Like a galaxy s2 that they could could can you look on any of the uh
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:59.040]   Uh, just curious chat room have you got the s store yet?
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:04.560]   Look on your would you look on your special google goggles?
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.000]   No, it's not here
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Yeah, I mean, I've got the Nexus s here, but that's not gonna get it. No. Yeah, hmm. Anyway
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.600]   There you go. So flip board and I don't have flip board though and that you'll have to get a galaxy s3 at least initially

[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:07.680]   All things d conference is going on right now and it's in the l area right? It's uh, yeah
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.400]   Usually it's in new york, isn't it? Is this new?
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.600]   No, no, no, no, no, no, it's always usually west coast. Yeah, okay
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.200]   Uh, so they saved tim's appearance to the evening
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.120]   Uh, which may it missed the news cycle
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:26.000]   Uh for the night, but it but it certainly caught the morning news cycle. I mean non-stop
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.920]   among other things we learned that a google. I mean a
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:36.640]   Apple iphone facebook integration was not out of the question. He said
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.880]   Oh, I saw sheryl in the lobby. We're good friends. We're buddies
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.840]   so maybe maybe tim cook has uh
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:50.000]   You know, he said we differ have each company has its own goals and of course, that's what makes life interesting
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.720]   But there's no reason we couldn't work together. He said stay tuned
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.960]   About facebook integration, which I thought was kind of interesting
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:04.320]   Uh, I think he also said that they missed the mark on ping that like most people didn't like he admitted it
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.080]   He said there are a few people who really like ping
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.560]   Uh, he also said and this may be telling he was talking
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   I think he was talking about apple tv, but that you know, we try stuff and if it fails we kill it
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:20.800]   Uh, which is interesting and I the the implication being that maybe uh ping
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.920]   Wasn't the thing
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:30.080]   Apple is said apple doesn't need to be social which I thought right interesting right. I think he's right. I think that
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.480]   That was a good lesson
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.960]   A lesson learned that they don't know how to do it well
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.520]   Apple is anti social I mean it defines the anti social company right?
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:44.240]   Yes, well, that's one of the things he said he said we're gonna double down on secrecy
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.000]   Right
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.760]   I think that's your next book, Jeff
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.760]   Well, every rule I ever write apple is the exact opposite and and and people say well
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.560]   How could that be and I say if you're that effing good you couldn't violate all of those. Yeah only yes
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   You're the exception that proves the rule
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.880]   So, uh, of course
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.600]   Uh dan from we're writing a read white web said well of course
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:11.760]   No new product announcements were made because they've doubled down on secrecy, but the way cook was acting
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:22.720]   His illusions his commentary about the tv business and some nervous chair twisting suggested he was hiding something
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:30.720]   That's exactly the level of analysis we're getting because he's basically said nothing right right
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.080]   He said stay tuned we might be doing something with but he didn't no wait, but he didn't say
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:42.400]   Cook gushed about how apple has great respect for facebook how he thinks apple can do more with the company
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.880]   And even laid out a logical explanation justifying why apple should work with facebook
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:52.000]   And said stay tuned so I guess that's kind of really an implication that yeah, we're gonna work with them
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.320]   Um
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:02.320]   When an abc news journalist is all dan from her writing when an abc news journalist asked cook about ping
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.320]   And
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.240]   Tim said I don't think we have to own a social network, but does apple need to be social yes
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.800]   And he gave an example how twitter is integrated into ios
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:19.520]   We tried ping and I think the customer voted and said this isn't something I want to put a lot of energy into
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:28.240]   Well, just like just like larry coming back in taking over one of the things you do is you is you clean house of things that don't work
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.600]   right
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.920]   I think tim showed himself to be a ceo
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:38.640]   You know he he can stand on his own he's you know, he's rapidly leaving behind the shadow of steve jobs
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:45.520]   He said in there that that steve said don't ask what steve would do with there goes my next book title
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.800]   That's car carmine gallows way ahead of you. He's written like eight books on what would steve do
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.160]   He's he's a little cottage industry on steve
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.720]   um
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:02.160]   You know, I think I think he
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.560]   He acquitted itself. Well
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:09.920]   He said the apple tv business is still not very big even though it's doubled in sales
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.840]   Um
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:18.800]   That and implied that it probably wouldn't be around a lot longer
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:24.800]   Uh the s in iphone 4s stands for syri confirmed that like we care
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:30.000]   He basically said we don't have any real strategy for naming. We just make up a name when
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.120]   Time comes along
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:38.560]   Uh carra asked him what the next iphone was going to be called. He said, uh, and does somebody else have a question?
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.960]   He's just kind of passed passed on that one
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:47.200]   Well, I mean wwdc is in 11 days. We will hear a lot at wwdc
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.640]   Yeah, I mean this wasn't his stage, right? This was terra and walt stage
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.800]   I think that I mean it's kind of refreshing that he was
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:58.240]   Fourth right about things like paying. I mean, it's not news to anybody that pang didn't get big uptake good for him
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   But you know, are you in the thing in the sphiccup china? What's that? Are you integrating pang in to think up?
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.640]   Yeah, no
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.800]   No, she's she's she's integrated into wave
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:14.480]   Actually, I think that uh, tim can be pretty gracious about facebook at this point
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:21.040]   Even though of course the story this week was that a number of former iphone engineers had gone to work at facebook developing a phone
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.840]   And i'm sure tim is going to be my guest
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:29.280]   You want to do a phone facebook go? I don't think that apple is too threatened by a facebook phone
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:35.680]   I feel like facebook making a phone is just a terrible idea. Yeah, like they're a software company that
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:41.680]   They should go for all phones. Everybody's got a facebook app on their phone now. Absolutely. There are already in the phone, right?
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:46.080]   Right. Yeah, the iphone is a facebook phone the android is a facebook phone like
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:54.720]   That's what they need to to be worrying about nik. I don't writing in the new york times this week quotes a facebook employee saying quote mark is worried
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:00.320]   That if he doesn't create a mobile phone in the near future that facebook will simply be an app on other mobile platforms
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.120]   Sounds great. Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:09.680]   But the funny thing is is that is that facebook gets a bad rep for its mobile app which i don't think is bad
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:15.120]   Google plus mobile app even the even the one on on android i don't think is very good
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.600]   The hilarious thing not to jump way ahead
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:23.120]   But the hilarious thing to me is the company i make the most fun in in life actually came up with a decent mobile app today
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.560]   What's that who is wait a minute the company he makes the most
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:31.120]   Chipotle
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.480]   NBC has a good mobile
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.040]   That's good gc
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:45.120]   You know that's the no as a good mobile app who has a good mobile app. Oh, yahoo. Yeah, that sounded like the nbc chimes
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.760]   I'm trying to yahoo
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.320]   Boy that was bad. He's trying to keep you a hint
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:57.280]   So you like the axis you like this axis browser well on a glance. It's really kind of it re thinks
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:02.960]   How search operates i'm at least somebody's even thinking it's attacking somebody's thinking the yahoo
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:08.880]   What's what's it really interesting to me is it's yahoo doesn't even have search. So i'm presuming this is using being
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:12.800]   Yeah, right. So that's even weirder
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:21.280]   But but it's it's you know, you look up look up the old report on on what's it called the structural day axis axis right?
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.960]   Yeah, here. Let's do it here. I'll show you know i actually i actually like it
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.680]   I don't know if i will ever launch it because you know you already got a browser and it's doing
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.680]   But as you could see the first thing it happens. I don't know how well you could see this is on an iphone
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:40.320]   Is i looked up leo report and it puts up thumbnails of all the pages and it's accurate by the way associate with me
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:47.280]   These are all accurate. You know, it's got my twitter feed wikipedia the kfi page the twit page of my personal blog
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.920]   Go to leo ville. Okay. Yeah
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.800]   So now it's gonna launch it in a browser
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:58.480]   And now you can you can move down the screen and your search results are still there. No. Oh if i if i scroll down, right?
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:04.640]   That's kind of nice this thumb you know, you're right actually i'm gonna i'm gonna say yeah kudos
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:11.360]   This is a nice saying is i you know i'm not sure why mobile is so fluxing
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.360]   Companies as big as facebook and google and that yeah
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:22.160]   Companies and it is a mobile app. That's that amazing. Well, yeah, who still has some good people there right? There are a lot of good people there
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:27.600]   So google does this thumbnail preview in there search results, right?
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:32.080]   That nice pull down when you choose that i've got i really like but the thumbnail preview that's not
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:37.760]   Anything too new right i mean google does it on the on the web page and the google.com. They don't do it on mobile
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:44.880]   But yeah, here's the thing i think i think they made it this stick for mobile so that they use what's appropriate that a list on mobile
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:49.520]   Isn't as good as something you you you scroll for swipe right? Yeah, you swipe through
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:54.640]   piece of trivia there i am the inventor of the patent the software patent that uh
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:01.280]   And i did it for ask jeeves of thumbnail previews of web pages and search results dude you ought to be suing
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:08.240]   Uh, no i'm the inventor not the asinee the asinee is ask jeeves which probably does not know that they have it
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.920]   Oh until today you just caught you just created a huge
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:16.080]   Opportunity for whatever remains of ask calm
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:24.720]   So you're an engineer at ask that's interesting. Yeah, i was i was uh there uh, there's syndication and distribution engineer my job was to
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.720]   To uh to take ask jeeves search results and put them on
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.840]   Weird places like dictionary.com. That's nice
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.400]   So i'm searching for leo loport
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.360]   And you're saying jina that there's thumbnails
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:41.120]   No, i don't just this is the google app i don't
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.200]   Out of this or maybe it was um, maybe it's image search
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.760]   No, maybe it's in the image search
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.200]   It did just work for me
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.000]   Image image search they have the the thumbnail stuff
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:00.320]   Let me do it. You have to do you have to tap on so if you so i'm looking at just regular search results for leo loport
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:06.800]   The list of blue links and here's images a little magnifying glass kind of next to one of the links to be tied if you tap on the magnifying glass
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.800]   Then you can point through
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:13.600]   Other web pages. Yeah, i mean the thing that access does that's good though is that it makes it so that you don't have to do that
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.440]   You know search
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:23.200]   Uh, look right don't find what you want go back hit the back button go, you know that that sort of rinse rather repeat stuff
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:28.640]   Um, and that's good, but i think it's going to take a lot more than that to to really compete with
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:34.480]   You know the safari bro. Oh, i mean, you know i was ready i was ready to just make make holy hell fun of them today and say
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:39.200]   Who did other search engine another role? Yeah, but but i you know give them credit where it's due
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.320]   And it does sink really well amongst the different platforms too, which is good. Oh that's neat
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.560]   Yeah
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.720]   Well, let's give them credit then i mean that's nice
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.320]   They're doing something so so back to facebook and the phone
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:55:00.000]   You know it's it's i think that's a sign of being flummoxed by mobile right? Well, what's going wrong? Okay, we'll make a phone then right?
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.880]   um
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:09.200]   This is where i think facebook should buy it should go ahead and buy four square and get some good mobile developers there
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:12.320]   speaking of which uh
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.600]   places
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.720]   is
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:21.600]   Now google so now i have okay so place i have a twit llc entry for places in google places
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.640]   It is now
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.200]   So now it's no longer in google places
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.160]   It's in google plus it's a google plus page
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.840]   Yeah
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:36.880]   With marissa myr making the announcement. Oh, she's local. She's local
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.560]   Local and there's a new button in google plus it says local
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:45.040]   But i not for my on my browser. It wasn't oh yeah, it's hidden under more
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:49.600]   I couldn't i moved it out of more, you know, they they have this extra stuff down here
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:53.200]   So i moved it out of more and put it up top don't have it there you don't have it, huh
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.720]   If you just go to plus google.com slash local you get to it though
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.920]   Yeah, that's what it is that it may be sign it then it did this whole sign in again bozo right they do this
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:11.840]   Is so atrocious i mean of all the information out there about local places the thing that google can do is tell us what restaurants to eat at
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:18.480]   Yeah, that's the that's the main thing i'm getting is restaurants if i scroll way down i get bridal shops
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:23.120]   The other announcement that came out is that the zagat is now free this i kind of like
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:27.520]   Yeah, and zagat's built into this so if i'm seeing a chinese restaurants
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:33.680]   Not zagat rated here's one that's zagat rated i could see the zagat rating for food and overall and that's
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.320]   No, no it's on my computer
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:41.760]   And that's um free. Yeah, although they haven't made the app free yet still ten dollars
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:47.440]   But i think they're gonna i don't know i mean but you know you don't have to subspace i've been paying the 30 bucks a year for zagat
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.200]   I love it
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.320]   It's worth it as matt cuts said and they uh tweet to me
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:57.360]   You know the great thing about this is that it'll probably also encourage being free more people contribute
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:01.040]   Right and so it will make the asset more valuable. You know, it's it's a virtuous circle
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:06.400]   Unfortunately, um, it is their restaurants bridal stores and stuff, but i don't see anything that would include twits
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.360]   So
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.440]   You'd actually then have to do a search for twit
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.160]   to have it show up here
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.200]   And uh, and here it is and then when i click on this
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.920]   This is
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.920]   We now have a page
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:26.320]   Wow, I um, that's our google plus page instead of our places page and this is all the data that was on places
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:29.440]   And that happened automatically leo they took the data
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.040]   Yep
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:35.600]   So leo go to go to maps and search for twit and see how it plays your page now
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.240]   That's good
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:43.280]   Uh, that's a very good idea here. So let's look for twits. That's the most powerful way to get a place page
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:49.520]   Right, that's how people are going to do it most of the time. So I now I have a link. I gotta fix the spelling
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.480]   and uh, there you go
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.360]   And it still shows up as a pin
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.400]   At just pretty much exactly as I had set it up
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.600]   Uh for places because I you know, I did the whole places thing
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:05.360]   But now when I click the link it goes to google plus so it doesn't change the maps presentation
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:10.640]   This isn't this isn't a huge loss. It's uh, it's really the same content in a google plus format
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.920]   And people could like it here and now there's the plus one
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.720]   They can reshare it. They can add pictures
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.880]   I think this is okay. I could live with this
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:27.760]   It's got a great score. Is that the zagot score? Yeah, my zagot score 29 out of 30, baby
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.840]   We have the best food here anywhere 124 reviews
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:36.640]   29 is extraordinary to perfection
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:40.000]   How about that
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.640]   Boom
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:47.760]   I don't know. I'm just I'm incredibly disappointed by this because I just
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:54.240]   I was in uh, I was at a conference last week and I gave a talk and I uh, I asked the audience
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.840]   Um two things in a row if you it was in Canada
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:04.000]   So they were extra ashamed because the Canadians are extra earnest people to begin with but so I asked
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.920]   Who is kim kardat? What is the kim kardashian's ex-husband's name?
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:13.680]   Uh, and everybody in the room knew the answer and then I said, what's the child poverty rate in toronto?
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.560]   Uh, and no one knew the answer, right?
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:25.120]   Um, and part of the reason behind that is because i was unfair teacher totally unfair, but she's part of the re it's it's actually 39
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.520]   but part of the reason behind that is because
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:32.640]   um people like to hear about the kardashian's more but another part of the reason I don't by the way
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.600]   Can I just say I don't know the answer to either question. Oh, I didn't either
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:39.360]   That's great. I don't either. Um, but the the
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.760]   Totally dead. I knew the answer
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:45.920]   I'll admit it. Anyway, go ahead
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:49.440]   part of the reason is because we we have actually google is
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:55.840]   Is becoming an accomplice to bad news and the reason why is because reporters are using
[00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:02.320]   Google trends to find stuff to write to right and you they have this incredible opportunity with local stuff
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:07.040]   Especially to say here's local information about your community
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:15.360]   Um, comma local reporter comma, whatever that you can actually now write to and actually improve local news a lot by you know, if you search for
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.640]   um, petaluma california, it should
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:27.600]   Tell you way more than than uh, then what restaurant seat it should tell you what the who your representatives are with the police. Oh, yeah
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.000]   Yeah, yeah, that would be useful
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.000]   Uh, what the child obesity rate is you know, everything about a community
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.760]   But the fact that the the best that the internet can do at telling people about their local communities is
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:47.040]   What restaurants to eat at or what houses to buy no wonder we're obese and in debt because we keep eating at restaurants and buying houses
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:54.480]   Well, if I do the the new uh search knowledge graph on petaluma california, I do get the wikipedia
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:01.200]   Link and I do get you know found at 1858 elevation 29 feet area and all that stuff
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.960]   So I'm getting some information that's in the search as opposed to the place
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.600]   the places
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:17.120]   Uh thing according to a marissa mire the recommendations you get in uh places the plus places the new what do we call it local
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:21.120]   The new local page uh come from your friends
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.640]   So places your friends mentioned
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.280]   so forth
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.080]   Just for you. So I'm getting recommended places mystic
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.920]   Theater that places from your circles logon. It is brewing company
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.520]   Then just for you demcys. I mean, so apparently these these recommendations are coming
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:46.080]   From my friends recommendation. So that's where that's where the plus side really does come in as it makes the social
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.160]   Yeah, it's local plus social
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.520]   It's the plusification of everything and that's what I don't like
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.400]   Uh, but you but you raise an interesting point
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.760]   Clay which is
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:02.720]   But is it it's not google's job in fact google's never wanted to be put in the position of deciding what information you should know
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.480]   It should all be crowdsourced, right? It's it's what people are interested in
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:12.480]   Yeah, people search for restaurants ergo google serves up restaurants. That seems completely fair
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:18.720]   In other words should google me making an editorial decision about what people should know about
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.080]   Well, google says that search is uh search is uh,
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.200]   akin to the new york times, uh, which they've said yeah, that's true then yes
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.720]   Well, I don't think you want that that's the problem is that you can't have it both ways google
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:37.760]   But they do but they do make editorial decisions all the time. That's matt cuts his job, right?
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.120]   But that in in they do
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:48.080]   The decision they make is algorithmic as opposed to based on what we want rather than what they think we should want
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.480]   And that's that that's the same media
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.120]   prejudice that that eliparas are
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.080]   Brings to this argument of saying well, you know, I want these gatekeepers. I want these curators
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.440]   I want these editors
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:05.920]   I want them to tell us tell society what they should think and google's the opposite of that and it's a different philosophy and I kind of like their philosophy
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.880]   I feel like what they're
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.240]   what they're doing right now is saying
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.680]   The only thing that's useful about
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:24.320]   Only useful information about a community is what restaurants are there or what places are there that are popular
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.680]   Google that's the audience saying what are people most searched on locally and the thing I most searched on locally
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:36.240]   I don't I'm not listen. I live in my community. I'm not every day saying hmm. What is the population chicken a chicken where do I eat?
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:43.040]   I think that's I think that's chicken a neck. I think that's a chicken an egg argument like you're saying you're using the internet because
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.040]   Uh to do that because that's the only thing that's there for right now
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:52.480]   But you know if you look at a if you look at city data calm city dash data calm
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.560]   They rank for every zip code pretty much in the country if you type in a zip code
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:01.120]   They're at the they're at the top of the list on on
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:07.440]   Google for most of the zip codes in the country and it's a ton of data about local communities
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:12.560]   And that's a different job. It's apparently it's not a search engine apparently
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.240]   That's a media data site and that has a whole different job a search engine
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:23.120]   On so a search engine site is also, you know a search engine's job is not is also not to help you book movie tickets, but
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.920]   Google does it right
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.480]   I mean
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:34.080]   To I don't want I'm glad we got a got rid of the the tyranny of editors saying what we should know
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.400]   I'm very happy to be without that and I was one
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.160]   I'm not I'm not suggesting that google
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.640]   Start determining everything about what it is that we should know
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:50.880]   I'm suggesting that there's more that people want to know about their local communities than restaurant reviews
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.040]   So it's a huge gaping hole
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.840]   All right, so I don't do it if it wasn't the case
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:02.320]   Uh, then city data wouldn't be in the I think they're in the top 1000 websites in the United States of america
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:08.640]   It's a crappy website, but when you go there you're sending a signal. This is the kind of information I want
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.640]   Yeah, and they're at the top for every for nearly every zip code when people want that particular kind of information
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:22.480]   Actually, I'm surprised they're at the top because I didn't even know they just in Toronto childhood poverty rate third listing is one day ago
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:28.160]   The un ranked canada 18th out of 35 industrial nations with child poverty rates, right?
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.320]   If that's what I want to know google's gonna tell me that
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.040]   Sure, but but if I'm looking for pizza
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.080]   The I guess clays point is that the fault is pizza
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:43.440]   Because that's what we ask for but I think if we all started asking for child poverty rates
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.520]   But then that's showing up there right blame us not google right
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.520]   I
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:55.520]   Google's a mirror that's putting back. It's trying to intuit our intent and give us what we're going to ask for
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.200]   And this is that's very familiar to me
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.840]   It's this is the exact argument I make in the book and it's and it's an argument
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:09.760]   I agree with you jeff it's and it's it's it's it is we're being given what we're what we're asking for
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:16.720]   I mean the premise and TV on on media everywhere everywhere that is the case
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.840]   Yeah, we are in whole we're in whole agreement there
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:26.720]   My only claim here is that as a user of the service. I wish there was more than restaurant reviews
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:31.840]   I wish that there that that search engine was providing more information to me. I think they've just started that
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:36.640]   I think they've got a local community. What is it you call that that the box of reasonable Wikipedia
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:39.520]   What's the thing they call you all that the knowledge graph knowledge graph?
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.600]   I think they're that's their first step in going to where you want them to go
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.960]   Which is that they're they are serving up stuff you didn't ask for that is
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:52.080]   Canonical knowledge about a topic and
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:56.000]   So I think they're headed the way you want them to head. I think I said
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:03.280]   Exactly why we should give the united nations more control of the internet so that child poverty stats
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:09.920]   Will come to the top of all google searches. Oh no it won't. Oh no it won't because governments will say we don't want to put that
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.920]   Oh
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:15.440]   That's a good point
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.320]   It is by the way, uh something the uh, united states house of representatives is considering
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.360]   But I can't imagine that that's gonna
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.720]   No
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.800]   Yeah, that'll plan a republican congress. Yeah, I I think that's not gonna happen
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.160]   The trilateral commission will next take care of the year. Yeah
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.560]   By the way, uh the un conference coming up in the december that's in Dubai. They'll be voting on it then
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.080]   I think Dubai should be in charge of what's on the internet
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:47.360]   Okay
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:53.520]   I you know, I this is the same argument that we get about television. Well, you know why is television such crap
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.080]   And if you do surveys
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:01.600]   But if you do surveys people say oh, yeah, I love pbs. I will watch public brack and they don't
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.200]   They just say they will and then what then then it's desperate housewives of
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:11.520]   But nicey all right now. You're making my argument for me in the days when we had nothing but gatekeepers controlling tv
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.400]   We have three channels. We had Gilligan's island, which might be cute and campy now when it's all you had kids
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.080]   Right it was awful. It was pretty bad when when we got more choice
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:26.400]   And there was a better chance to listen to what we wanted. We got better quality more choice yields better quality
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:31.680]   It's a paradox. Well, there's been there's more niches. It's like us. It's so we can do this because we because uh
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.000]   Digital technology has made it cheap enough the internet gives us distribution
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.080]   We could do something. It's you know defiantly niche that could never be broadcast on mass media because two small in audience
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:47.440]   Yeah, uh, and there's probably two small in audience for look madmen only a million people watching and
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.880]   Minus jeff Jarvis and not one of them
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:59.120]   And uh, and yet it's very culturally important but uh, but I don't think it would make it on a broadcast television because it's the ratings be too low
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:05.600]   Aaron sorkin's new show is on hbo because it's far too politically charged to be put on the
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.080]   The networks they'd never run it
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:15.840]   Well, and that in two out of three of his shows have failed on broadcast television, right? I keep I rest my point studio 60 failed
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.560]   Which is a which one of the greatest shows of all time
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.560]   You hated it? Oh, it's a great show
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:28.080]   Actually ran a petition saying called save studio 60 calm you and me clay i'm with you now
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.400]   I'm on your side throw this Jarvis guy off the show
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.200]   Doesn't like madmen
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.840]   Beat it
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.640]   You're out of tv critic. I yeah, I gotta
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.280]   It's your fault that we got all that crappy tv
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.680]   To this day to this day
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:50.400]   Every once in a while. I read every six months or so somebody will come up and and stir up the fact that I gave babylon
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.920]   Five a bad review and i'm about to get killed for it by saying it with this audience. No, no, no
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.920]   I agree with you
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.720]   Don't go there don't go there
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:05.920]   I didn't like babylon five either, but I don't see I am on record is saying science fiction on tv is a bad idea because
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.960]   The budgets are too low
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:15.680]   And anyway, but that's let's not go there. I'm gonna get in trouble too. I didn't like the Avengers either. Did you like the Avengers jina?
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.480]   Loved it. Yeah, see it was incredible. It's joss Whedon. You can't not like joss Whedon. That's
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.640]   It's not joss Whedon. It's joss Whedon cashing in
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.360]   Big difference you're a sexist
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:32.560]   Yeah, that's true you're sexist and i'm
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:38.480]   That's true. I think joss should be allowed to marry anybody he wants
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:42.560]   Um, all right. We're gonna take a break on that note
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:47.200]   God the sponsors are going please leo can you have jina read this ad
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:54.640]   Please leo do not endorse our product now you're giving no leo no go there
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.720]   booties
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.360]   I've got cooties
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:03.200]   That's true buffie the vampires layer wasn't exactly
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:08.320]   High culture what okay are you out of your mind now?
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.520]   We're now we're going at it because buffie is a great show. It was a great show and I know it was
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:19.200]   Budget and kind of insane, but it was a great show. It was a feminist show. It was interesting show
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:25.360]   I had such a strong following. I love buffie. I love buffie sort of like angel
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.280]   Dollhouse is great. Uh, firefly serenity loved firefly and serenity
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:34.320]   Okay, all right. So now we're gonna get some more that actually contradicts my point the tv
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.400]   Sifie's bed because that was very good sci-fi on tv. It was dollhouse
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.480]   I didn't I didn't watch that. I'm not interested. Allhouse was a great show sexist
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.680]   No dollhouse was not sexist. It wasn't it was yeah, it was the opposite
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:49.920]   It looked sexist, but it wasn't it looked sexist
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.240]   That's why i watch it because i'm a champion of females and bacon
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.200]   It was a wrapped bacon
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:02.000]   Kind of wise. That sounds good
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   I'm gonna have to watch buffie and dollhouse
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.760]   I didn't watch buffie. Have you like given buffie?
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.560]   Okay, I'm gonna admit I saw the movie
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.480]   No, no, it was terrible man. Truly horrible
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.640]   Joss we didn't have anything to do with the movie. No, no joss. No, no, no, no, no
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.640]   You got it. You wrote it? That movie was total. Okay. Yes
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.840]   And then I think I might have watched like the first episode
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.960]   I should watch it. I'll watch it's good. You know what i'm trying to do is i'm saving up stuff for the old age home
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.760]   Because I know that when I get there, I'll be there's gonna be show like signfell
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.760]   I haven't seen every episode so i'm saving it up
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.000]   For when I have time
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.800]   All right, dr. Horrible your musical guy. I like dr. Horrible
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.760]   I like dr. Horrible. No, I think a lot of things joss weeden did were good. I just
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.720]   Okay, nevermind. I'm just digging it deeper
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:54.400]   You are you're digging deep. That's a bad news for you leo
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:13:00.720]   Avengers had boring bits admitted. It was a crappy movie. It was a comic book
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:07.600]   It had fun bits, but it had boring bits the best the fun bits were all just weeding bits like the shakespearean moment between Loki and thord
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.960]   Now that was good
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:13.920]   Yeah, and then and then iron man shows up and says what is it shakespeare that was good and that was pure. We
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:19.520]   Called back and forth that was good. Oh, that was a high point. Right. Yeah, yeah, the way hulk
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:25.920]   treated Loki was a high position up and up in the sky thing. Oh god, horrible
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.480]   Horrible, I didn't even understand it
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:32.000]   The humans we all excuse in that thorn and ankle tour
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.640]   Okay
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.520]   And then the idea was that's what it sounded like to me. Oh, stent for kill them
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.160]   Okay, it was you know, I took it to be like here a bunch of really different characters
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:49.280]   I lost all the movies, you know kind of leading up to it all the different characters
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.360]   I mean the fact that they were able to
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.320]   You know
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.800]   Have those characters interact in a way that was kind of fun and entertaining and team up and the dynamic
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.640]   Between them. I thought we're good. There are a couple few lines that were pure weeding that I really enjoyed
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:04.400]   Anyway, I'm I this was nice as joss attempted to write
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.880]   Each like when it was Thor like this is like the Thor movie and and robert down in jr
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.120]   Really had iron man lines and so yes, he was trying to follow the genre, which I thought was kind of interest
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.600]   Interesting exercise. That black widow was great black widow was great black widow was very good rubber suit girl
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.600]   She was very good. The interrogation scene was fantastic. Yeah, that was good
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.960]   That was that was total weeding where she says i'm interrogating them. Yeah, i'm interrogating. It's going really well
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.560]   It's going really well. It's like what that was that was class. All right. All right
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.840]   You're straight up Buffy right there 100% of the movie was great
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:38.480]   100% admit it
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.800]   I
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:47.440]   All right, actually you're right now i'm trying to think of i'm trying to think of anything bad in the movie and I can't
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:50.400]   So I think you're I think you're right. I think I actually enjoyed it
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.280]   boom
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.320]   Boom

[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.840]   I'm but i'm in charge of america

[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:04.720]   Google complied
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.680]   But good news if you're looking for xbox piracy information, there's a search engine called bing
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.800]   That has it all
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:18.400]   They claimed a copyright violation on 500,000 half a million in fringing
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.920]   Search results if you use this google transparency tool
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.880]   That which tech dirt did
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:31.440]   They found those links related to pirated xbox content microsoft asked google to take him down google did
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:36.480]   But they forgot I guess they forget I guess nobody at microsoft uses bing
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.680]   Oh
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.800]   So

[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.680]   Um
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.280]   Gmail was down. I didn't know this. Did you do anybody have trouble with gmail?
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.040]   I miss every time I click on a message
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:00.720]   I'm gonna. I'm gonna play
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:06.160]   Um the grump down. Okay. Every time gmail goes down now people act like it's a story
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:14.000]   See now that I love jos weeding so much you are the
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.520]   Focus are of our approbation
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.320]   I
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.200]   Ruffalo is a great choice for the whole b
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:29.920]   Angry yeah, don't make jeff angry. He's already pink
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:37.520]   I'm always angry especially when leo says he doesn't like jos weeding work. Oh
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:44.320]   No, I didn't say I don't like jos weeding zwerk. I said you like the avengers. I like jos's work a lot
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.480]   I
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:52.000]   Actually, you're right jeff. This is 0.11 of the users for
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.720]   It's imagine if we did us well, of course we used actually did do a story every time twitter was down
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:02.400]   But we used to we stopped we stopped right so you know what google's not perfect
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.120]   Good news
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:10.880]   The headline is gmail was down for 400,000 users the headline wasn't that sounds down was was down for zero
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.800]   1 1 yes, that sounds worse doesn't it yeah, yeah
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:19.360]   Hey, here's something you don't hear every day french court backs google
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:27.760]   A court rude the google is not responsible for filtering content on youtube french broadcaster tf1 which by the way
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.800]   broadcasts our friend
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:35.920]   What's his name? It's my good close personal
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.040]   plena kren
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.360]   Oh, I can't remember his name. I'm so sorry
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.240]   It's in french. That's why
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:53.920]   Tf1 wanted damages for copyrighted sports and movies which were ending up on youtube claimed 141 million euros and damages
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:21:00.320]   They in turn ended up paying google's legal fees to the tune of 80,000 euros
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:05.360]   Same same thing happened in last year with daily motion. So that's the good news
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.800]   right
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.160]   The defendant is not responsible and principle for the video content on its site only the users of the site are
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.920]   Google has this is actually going farther than the dmca
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:24.080]   Google has no obligation to police the content before it's put online as long as it informs users that posting
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:29.600]   tv music concerts or advertisers without prior consent the owner is not allowed
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.560]   Actually, I guess that's similar to the us
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:36.400]   Tf1 is deciding whether to appeal the decision
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:41.120]   Did it get quiet in here
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:47.920]   Are you still thinking about jos weed, aren't you?
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.000]   I'm still thinking about the Avengers. I'm still thinking about all the reason why Buffy was such an important piece of
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.920]   I'm gonna watch it. No, no, I didn't I
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:59.440]   I can't come I can't say anything about Buffy all I knew about it was it was high school girls murdering vampires
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.680]   I don't know how good it was
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:05.360]   It's not low week. It's not patrick cedrick at gla
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.360]   Planet college -
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:12.560]   John's an FYI. Oh, they were in college too. I went on for so long. They ended up graduating
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.960]   That's right. It's right at the end of the second season. I think
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:21.120]   Yeah, I mean so the vampires thing is weird, but jos' whole concept was like
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:26.160]   I like this young girl and monster like walking over that galley and a girl walks out. Yeah, he's funny
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.760]   I watched I think I saw the the pilot. I think I saw the first one
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:36.640]   I just you know never judge a show on its pilot. The pilots are always terrible. Yeah, you're right. You're right
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:41.200]   It's always like a caricature of what the show right right becomes
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:47.280]   The the western wing is absolutely awful, but the studio 60 pilot was very good
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:59.280]   I have not seen the studio 60 so I don't know. Oh, it's such a good show. How could you you're too young for a june?
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:05.440]   No, it's not that long ago. It was recently like oh six or seven. Oh, it was a while. I was a critic that I think no
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.880]   2000 it was 2005 2006
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.800]   was uh
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:17.120]   It was actually like 2000 60 thousand seven because yeah, because I was I used the blue state tools to run my petition site
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.760]   And I got them for free because I was working at blue states. Oh, that's cool
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.640]   That's cool
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.640]   So erin sorcan by the way who is
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.080]   We were just talking about because he's got that new news show
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.160]   Uh is gonna is been tasmin tap to write the steve jobs biopic
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:37.440]   We didn't I don't know if we mentioned that but remember how critical we were of his treatment of the internet geeks
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:43.680]   uh technology in the social network. I wonder if he's the right guy to he seems to have some antipathy straight out
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:50.320]   That he's he's you know, not up to speed on technology. It's not that hard to get up to speed anymore erin. Yeah
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:56.960]   The good news is that there's there's a bit more factual source material for
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.160]   um, right sorcan to work with here than there was with uh the social network
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.880]   He said that he's he's
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:13.200]   The way he writes it is is as if jobs is asking to get into heaven. Oh dear. Oh no. Oh, oh dear. That sounds terrible
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.000]   That sounds like a bad idea. Oh, they're not gonna have an angel named clarence. Are they?
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.560]   Oh
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.760]   They're not gonna this isn't the ashton movie right so the ashton movie is a different one
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.920]   No, this is a different one the ashton movie is just for the early years. We're good
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:32.240]   We're gonna ignore the ashton movie sarken. Uh also speaking in all things d
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:37.920]   Uh said i'm at the earliest possible stage with the steve jobs movie adaptation. It'll look more like
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:40.480]   watching espn
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.680]   Which seems to the untrained eye to look like watching college football
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.240]   It's a process of procrastination where you try to figure out what the movie is about
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.480]   Walter isics in road to terrific biography
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.560]   But in making movies about these kinds of things it's difficult to shake the cradle to grave structure
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.040]   That's true. He did that with the social network remember in fact
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.640]   One of the things that discombobulated me a little bit
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:03.360]   There was a lot of flash forward flashback because they would do the trial and they did flashback and trial
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.120]   He's looking to make a interesting structure instead of just making a good movie
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.120]   um
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:12.160]   So i'm probably not going to write a cradle to grave instead
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.920]   I'll probably identify the point of friction that appeals to me then approach that
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:24.000]   He says uh, he didn't know jobs one of his hesitations was that he was a little like writing about the beetles
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.880]   There are so many people out there who know him and revere him. It's true. It is a minefield for him
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:34.480]   Hopefully when i'm done like josh wedon josh wedon for you. Yeah, yeah
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:40.640]   Now josh wedon wrote the bio pick that'd be good or jj
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.240]   You know steve jobs suddenly starts throwing people around in medians. Yeah
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.840]   boom boom boom boom
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:55.280]   if it was if it was um all uh if it was written by josh wedon it would be told from the point of view of um
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:58.240]   Uh jobs his daughter, right?
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:01.760]   That actually that that's true. That would be interesting
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:06.720]   Lisa who stood up to him that one female engineer who basically stood up to him in the early days, right?
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:10.080]   So her name was norma ray ladies and gentlemen
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:13.360]   um
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.360]   Huh
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.360]   interesting
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.560]   Moving along
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:24.640]   australia also giving google a pass on the street view probe they were thinking about a privacy probe after looking at the u.s
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.640]   Decision not to uh prosecute
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:29.280]   They said okay
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.560]   They dropped they dropped the case. Oh, there's a new chrome book
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:37.360]   This is interesting. It's a chrome box
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:40.160]   Well, they're both they looks like a mac mini
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:45.840]   Yeah, they have a box in a book the price is still high the price is still 449. That's too much because it all it is
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:54.400]   Is a browser. I don't exactly the new the new interface is really nice. I think I mean, it's got the it's got like a desktop background and windows
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.360]   All right, it's got really interesting window management
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:03.760]   The problem it seems is really that they're really suffering from a still local storage like well, but they're but they're changing that
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:06.320]   You're so able to pin
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.520]   You're gonna be able to store documents locally and pin documents to your local machine
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:15.120]   So if they don't die, it'll have the n number of most recent documents
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.760]   You've had open and then you can pin documents permanently
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.400]   And if they can get you know offline document usage and offline mail and that kind of stuff
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:27.520]   I think the chrome book starts to become somewhat serious, but I of course then I said that before they've replaced the
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:32.560]   Google drive with chrome OS is that oh I presume that that's built in that's what it is
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.440]   You're pinning things within drive right okay
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:42.480]   Replacing the atom processor with a seluron process. I'm surprised it's still around. Yeah, I know when I heard that too
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:45.680]   I was like really I guess they had some in a box somewhere
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:50.080]   12.1
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.080]   Hey, we got some Joey we got some of those
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:54.960]   seluron chips and the basement there that we
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.560]   We had left over from yeah, we could give you some of those
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.800]   cheap
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:08.320]   12.1 inch display 1280 by 800 starts up in seven seconds weighs 3.3 pounds six hours battery life
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.800]   449 for the Wi-Fi only
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.960]   549 for Wi-Fi plus 3g
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:16.720]   I'm so the question doesn't have LTE. That's a little disappointing yeah
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.440]   Google says it's two and a half faster time faster than last year's models
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:27.280]   And then the chrome box the mac mini version three and a half times faster because there's no battery issue that one's cheap
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.920]   29 of course you need a keyboard mouse and monitor
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:38.800]   I can see getting a chrome box for like schools and stuff. Well, yeah, I mean I I was I was talking to another school about about about
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:43.520]   Working with them let's put that way and
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:49.680]   Much larger than the one I'm at now and it occurred to me that that we're very close to the point where as you know a journalism student
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.880]   You we require ours at cuny to all get mac laptops
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:59.760]   You could every student could use a chrome sure and you could do all the tasks you do online where there's we video
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:04.480]   You could add a video online. You can add a photos online. You can certainly obviously text online
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.120]   Um, and and it's very close to the point where you could legitimately do that
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:14.000]   And have an incredibly powerful tool for very low price so compared to buy into macbook
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.600]   449 eight bad but for what you're getting still seems high
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:21.520]   It's still kind of high. I wouldn't buy this yet. I still can't get over
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.560]   I still can't get over the hole. It just feels like i'm just all i'm getting as a web browser and browsers are
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:31.840]   Are free, you know, you know, I think that the you know starting up in seven seconds. Awesome
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.480]   Not ever have an update my operating system awesome
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:40.160]   But I don't think that that's what people when they're buying a new computer or thinking about like how long is it gonna start up?
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:43.440]   I mean that's the kind of thing that does create friction and in your usage over time
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.480]   But you think like how powerful is this thing what programs can I run on it?
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.040]   This is just a browser
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:56.400]   I gotta update my Chromebook because the the aura I guess was pushed out to uh all the old Chromebooks as well
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:00.480]   This is the new windowing interface. This might help a little bit because I think
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.360]   It's it's not so much that it's a browser
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.040]   It's this that it's one full window
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:09.840]   Maybe if we can have windowing you think jina that and that the appearance of a desktop that might make you feel better
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:15.920]   It feel a little bit more like like a real computer. I feel still feel like i'm paying real computer prices for
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:21.920]   A browser, you know for especially if no one goes coming out with a with a $200 tablet, right?
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:26.880]   like I'd much rather surf the web on a $200 tablet than a
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.680]   $500. Yeah, but is this for you?
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:35.040]   Is this is something where you where you could suddenly have thousands of of your employees using the machines?
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:39.280]   That's exactly right. I think it's about business and schools right business is cool. So I agree
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:43.200]   Because there there you want constrained environments. You don't want to mess it around with
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.080]   You know playing games you want to security
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:49.840]   I have to put or you have to turn enable the developer channel
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.680]   I apologize for not having done this. I have a
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:55.920]   Chromebook in the other room and I will I will turn on the developer channel and get an unstable release
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:00.240]   And uh, we'll put or on there next next week. I'll show you or uh, it looks pretty good
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:02.800]   I mean I think it's it's all a optical illusion
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:09.200]   But giving you windows and icons at the bottom that say these your apps might be sufficient. There's somewhat ironic. I know
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:12.480]   Well, it looks like
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:14.480]   a computer with a desktop
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.120]   My first computer
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:21.680]   Uh, they're gonna google docs is going to be enhanced so that you can have offline editing and they're gonna bring that back
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:27.200]   Yeah, it's a june, uh, or i can end a june is the is the rumor on that so that's great
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:32.160]   And of course google driving implementation also. I don't know. I think this could be good
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:38.400]   One of the reviews was talking about some of the limitations of this are you know, you can't
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:44.720]   If you're listening to music on it, you've got a sort of hunt down the tab that's playing the music
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.840]   Um in your browser and then you know
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:53.680]   Press the pause button in the browser and stuff like that on your laptop and you know
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:57.760]   I think we take for granted all the sort of shortcuts we have on our computers now
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:03.680]   Um such that that that's kind of stuff is going to be really inconvenient for the for the end user
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:07.920]   Which is again? Why I think this is really about business and schools and and that's about it
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:11.200]   um, I can see decking out a school in
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.200]   Uh school classrooms not maybe not their computer science labs, whatever
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:22.640]   Of those we have left, but um, you know decking out classrooms with uh with chrome boxes sounds like a good idea
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:27.280]   Well, even better than decking out classrooms with them deck out students homes with them
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:31.840]   Right in this you get you you start to see the one laptop per child philosophy
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:34.400]   Starting to become possible
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:41.840]   Where you could have a truly powerful machine that has the entire internet with every bloody app and function you could possibly imagine there
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:46.640]   Now available, you know, you start to get that that down to a price of 200 bucks
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:49.120]   Uh or 250
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:53.280]   Um, that becomes very very powerful for education extremely powerful. I think
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:59.680]   I think the sad part for me is that they're really not you know, you're not going to give somebody they're not tinkering machines, right?
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:01.680]   Like I learned how to write code
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:02.960]   uh
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:06.560]   In part because I had a computer that I could tinker with right?
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:11.600]   Neither is it apple is it clay? I think a mac is oh, yeah in fact apple comes
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:18.880]   Come's caution comes with a free development environment ruby pearl python. It's all included. I mean, it's it's begging you to uh hack
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:22.480]   Right. That's why a lot of effect why a lot of developers use max
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.120]   A chrome booms not right um
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:28.160]   Well, the chrome does have that switch there's a terminal right?
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.000]   Yeah, and you can go in a cross. Yeah, the cross terminal and you can you can play with it a little bit
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.960]   You can't say anything. It's got bash. Does that bash?
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:37.520]   Well, how about ht bill?
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.360]   Try and try and check out think up off of get hub
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:49.280]   Uh, uh, and check them back in on chrome book. I don't think you'll be able to do it and have a decent experience
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:53.040]   Speaking as a truck as a truck owner. You want your car to be a truck
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.800]   Yeah, that's exactly right
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:56.800]   But I you know two things there is one
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.960]   Uh when we talk about education for me
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:05.280]   What's like a very important thing to me is that we we don't have computer science education in schools and we we ought to
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:10.800]   Um and a chrome book isn't gonna help enable that. I don't think or a chrome desktop
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.360]   Isn't gonna help enable that it's gonna be very hard for people to
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.920]   to tinker and write code on
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:18.320]   On ipads and and chrome books
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:22.320]   You have a chrome but schools have servers and you ask a station to them and you play at that command line
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:24.400]   You know what I mean? I mean, I I code on my ipad
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.160]   I get just bought dicota, which has a nesusage client and you know, I did you know
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:32.960]   It's not on the actual local computer, but the good thing is you know, it's good enough for bill gates
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:38.320]   His mom held a bake sale so they could time share and have a terminal in the closet
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:43.040]   Right. I mean, right when I was in college, we had we had you know partnership with IBM
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.080]   We had these like terminals right along with to the dibm mainframe
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.440]   I thought you're older than I thought
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.840]   I know crazy
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:51.840]   I use punch cards
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:00.080]   Last story and I know you'll all be relieved. It's very exciting. I just went to my orkut page
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:05.040]   And uh, and it looks like they're finally moving it over to google plus
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.520]   Oh no
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.360]   Link your google plus and orkut profiles
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:15.520]   What am I gonna do? What are the brazilian readers of the information diet gonna do?
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.840]   How are they gonna get in touch with I don't know are you on our kut good? Let me add you
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:22.720]   Finally, I only have six friends here, you know
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.680]   play a johnson
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:28.880]   Orkut user
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:34.160]   Hmm now here's one problem. I searched for clay johnson and I got tony time
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:37.920]   Melissa mire Becca galesp none of these people actually have tony
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:42.720]   I mean clay or johnson in their name. Oh, there's Melissa clay. There you go. Is that you?
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.120]   Yeah, that's me with how are dean. Oh, that's how old you're a cut profile is
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:56.080]   Yeah, okay. I'm gonna say hi clay. I'm gonna include you in no group and there you go
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:59.120]   So now when I move to google plus
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.920]   You'll just come right along with me
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:04.560]   Oh boy
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:10.640]   That's it push all you know, basically this is uh, we're linking them baby. We're that's it for our cut by by our cut
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.600]   It's now google plus
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:20.080]   You know the the Atlantic did a great piece on uh, how you know how google should get rid of google plus
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:23.440]   That that that that google has created google google plus in order to get more signals
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.200]   Which is what jeff has been saying this whole time?
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:30.800]   But what they should do is take the communities that they already have and and sort of nurture them
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:36.240]   Right so like or cut what was big in what brazil is that yeah brazil is in india
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.720]   I mean youtube had a really our has a really strong art community google reader
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:45.440]   And like all these little communities are now being sort of taken over by the you know the classification of everything
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.000]   They're kind of retrofitting all these existing communities small communities throughout google's product
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.560]   Into the google plus structure and how that's really that's really a bummer because
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.280]   You know that's about google trying to get
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:00.560]   Standardized, you know structured data from all its communities
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:04.000]   You know so that it could get better signals and and provide better search results
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.440]   And that the argument was like, you know facebook makes social tools
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:13.200]   So that help to help people connect with one another right google makes a social tool in order to connect with its users better
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.760]   So it was a really good good piece and it reminded me the orcut
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:21.200]   Transition Facebook makes everything facebook-y
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:24.960]   Right well
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.520]   Well, I mean facebook's whole approach was different right because it was it was a standalone product
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:33.840]   But the product was built with the idea of like people should be able to connect and share
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:37.440]   Uh more efficiently right whereas google plus
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:42.080]   It's kind of same mission, but really it's like we just we want to collect plus ones
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:46.400]   We want to know your social graph. We want to be able to give you better signals and get you better content
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:51.520]   I was appalled for you better advertisements and better outrisants. It's slightly different
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.600]   I can't well
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:00.080]   I still like plus. I don't like I actually like plus two. I I don't know these stories about how it's a ghost town annoy me
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.040]   They do yeah, and the New York Times really irritated me yesterday
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:05.040]   I'm not gonna find it in the flash
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:11.520]   But they had a story about about something around social and they just they just did a slap parenthetical slap to google plus
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:15.840]   You know the the still oh, I know here it was it was their google chrome story. Ah, I'm like my iPad
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.400]   um
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.600]   Last thing I read before I got pissed off and I closed it
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.640]   And then dropped it it says here
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:27.840]   Stopped we turn it into the incredible hulk
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:34.240]   All right, it's an open question whether the changes are enough to make chrome
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:37.600]   Which is also the name of google's browser more than a marginal player
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.400]   But the system is impressive and designed to work seamlessly with google products like android phones and the porens
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:47.760]   Still underwhelming and porens google plus social network. Oh, that's in a news story
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:50.400]   and
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:54.480]   I found that was going over the over the line New York times
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:39:03.120]   So much for the your own underwhelming paper of record. They probably didn't like the avengers either
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:07.680]   Yeah, that's right. We're gonna. I'm having too much fun and we've gone way over
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:12.240]   So we're gonna take a break come back with our tooltip a number of the week as we wrap things up this week
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:17.840]   On this week in google, but first a word from our good friends at ford motor company the ford focus
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:24.960]   Electric is finally here at an ev certified ford dealer near you you can find out more about it at ford.com slash
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:29.520]   Technology ford was you know, I admit there were others did electric cars sooner
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:34.800]   And I asked uh allen malally about it ceo ford. He said look we wanted to do it right
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:37.120]   We still wanted to really take our time and think about it
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:42.480]   So that we could put electric vehicle technology in all of our vehicles across the board
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:48.720]   Uh, they have plug-in hybrid and all electric vehicles. The new focus is out and it is amazing
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:55.440]   I mean it is best in class most fuel efficient five passenger vehicle in america
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:00.080]   Best city rating in its class 110 110 mpge
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:07.840]   Best in class driving range 76 miles charges in three to four hours on the 240 volt charger
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:15.040]   That's the best in class. That's actually half the time of the nissan leaf. They did it right. They did it best and now it's here
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:20.560]   And i'm so excited. I want you to take a look at the 2012 focus. You could drive it at a ford dealer near you take a look at the new
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:25.360]   Uh in car electronics the new my ford touch and ford sink updated
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:28.160]   Just for the ford focus electric
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.800]   Really really cool stuff
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:36.320]   Uh the dashboard. I mean you know what's you know, you know the temperature of the battery the conditioning of the battery
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:41.440]   You can precondition that to the car with your smartphone say hey warm it up. I'm about to get in
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:46.560]   The mobile app lets you monitor your your your battery, but also schedule
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:51.040]   Uh when the charge goes so you can actually charge it at the lowest
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:54.160]   rates
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:56.320]   Android apple and blackberry
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:02.320]   I'll tell you what you're going to be very happy if you get a 2012 ford focus
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.280]   You will be joined the many people now are just flipping over this thing
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:12.960]   Check it out ford.com/technology or drive one in an ev certified dealer near you and then next year early next year the 2013
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:16.160]   ford fusion energy hybrid plug-in
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:23.440]   Well, we'll talk about that next year. I'm excited about that one. I can't wait for that. I can't wait for that. I won't want
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:27.760]   That's the car. I that's I was gonna get the focus and I thought oh boy the plug-in would be great
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.400]   I need one. I wish they'd do the the the suv one because I need four-wheel drive
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.800]   Well
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.080]   You have connections. Stay tuned. Can you make that happen? Well, what he told me is we're gonna
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:43.360]   Every car we make eventually every vehicle we make will be able to get it in in gas diesel
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:46.960]   Electric hybrid plug-in hybrid and with it
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:51.440]   It's the same line and they just change as demand ramps up for one or the other
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.200]   This has been the problem all along as you build a line for electric vehicles and nobody buys them
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:59.680]   What do you do? That's why Chevy stopped production of its vault because they made as many as they needed
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:08.640]   Um, so what they're doing is very smart. They they can they can change minute to minute. I'm really making they do they do they also know how to use facebook
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:11.840]   That's unlike it up unlike a certain other company. We shall shall
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.840]   By the way, just don't just let it know
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:18.000]   So gm. Don't facebook a case story came out this week that said what actually what gm wanted to do
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.880]   Was to do one of those huge obnoxious ad takeovers of all of facebook sorry
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.600]   Facebook said no, sorry
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:30.480]   I just want to replace the car key with my phone
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:37.280]   Uh use keys. I can open up the doors to my house with my uh with my iphone now. I think i'll
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:39.600]   I think my car too
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:43.520]   Let me check that. I bet you could I bet you could do that. You know, it's a push button start
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:49.280]   That's an interesting idea. I like that with nfc you could probably just tap the dashboard
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:53.840]   I see clay just just you know hitting a button on his face on his glasses
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:58.320]   It'll make your car easier to steal
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:02.080]   There you go and those glasses nobody's gonna steal this
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:06.720]   Oh, he turned left. I just took your picture
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:10.160]   Let me see it. Can you share that with me
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.960]   our
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.960]   Tip of the week from jina tarpani
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:22.320]   Google voice users already know that you can set up different rules depending on what contacts
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:27.680]   You know who's calling and and what what contact group they're in but google voice just added two new contact groups
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:30.240]   Which are automatic and pretty useful. You can say
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:35.200]   Follow this set of rules rule rules for all the people in my contacts
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:40.240]   So you can say you know play my greeting or forward any call from anybody in my contacts to this phone
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.960]   And that's just everybody and that's it already in your context list
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:46.320]   And you can also set up new rules for anonymous callers
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:50.960]   So people who don't who you know that that your phone doesn't recognize the the phone number
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:54.720]   So you can say don't forward any anonymous callers or given the standard greeting
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.880]   So if you go in google voice if you go to settings
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:03.680]   And in groups in the groups and circles tab you'll see those two no groups anonymous callers and all contacts and you can set up
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:08.000]   different call screening greetings and forward reporting rules for them
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:13.440]   My uh, I have a call greeting for family members only that says I love you
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.720]   And jennifer said do you say that to everybody?
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:20.480]   It said no, I have a very sophisticated phone system
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:24.160]   I only love the people I love
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:26.400]   It's one of the best it's one of the best things about google voice
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:28.960]   You can do this and I really wish that gmail had this filter
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:35.520]   I would love if gmail said, you know if I could say do this with emails, you know with messages for anybody who is just in my
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:40.880]   In my gmail address anybody who I emailed ever and you know in the past
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:43.040]   I'm going to assume that I want to hear from them, right?
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:46.400]   So do something special with them. Yeah, that's a span that's kind of a spam feel
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:49.840]   I think we're going to have authentication filters where if this person's authenticated
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.400]   It's good if not put him in a suspect folder
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.640]   I just want to get rid of the phone numbers soon as we can get rid of the phone number. Thank god
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.880]   We're what would you prefer?
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.080]   Everybody suggests the next book I should write I think the next book you should write is the people diap
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:08.160]   There's too many people. There's too many. That's actually a cookbook
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:14.240]   To serve mankind. That's that's the guy in LA who was eating the face. I know yeah
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:17.040]   Oh god, don't go there. Oh
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:20.960]   Jeff Jarvis your number of the week
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.920]   Well, I was going to go with 28 19, which is the price of facebook stock at closing today
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:27.600]   Which by the way
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:34.000]   Gets the market cap down to 60 billion and and already bumped zuck off the list of the 40 most rich people
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:42.000]   That could use that actually I actually made my google glasses with uh with sold facebook shares
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.520]   He didn't uh
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:51.360]   Tip a waitress in Italy on their honeymoon. I think the problem was he just gave me share a stock and by the time
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:54.880]   With 28 bucks
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:00.000]   Hold on. It's going back up. I have faith. I'm actually this might be a buy signal
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:08.000]   Real number. I think it is the real number because I like this a lot is that still a service did a survey
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.760]   Of of how companies are using twitter customer service
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:18.880]   And and out of the top 25 online retailers zappos and llv you know the most responsive on twitter answering
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:21.440]   100 of customer tweet
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.680]   Wow, that's amazing really impressive. I think other top performers included over stock at 98
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:29.200]   Dell
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:34.400]   My old friends at del at 98. Oh how they learn wonderfully and best buy at 89 percent
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:38.880]   My tool of the week i'll just go quickly. We already showed it on
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:45.760]   Uh, the iphone finally android has the google plus app that I now you said you don't like this jeff
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:51.520]   But I think it's just spectacular what it really does is highlights how good images look so it kind of
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.040]   It's it's pro images
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:57.600]   But I think this is just a beautiful app and uh, and I think they did a nice job on android
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:00.560]   It especially looks good on in a galaxy note on that big format
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:05.040]   Um, if you haven't updated your google plus app android or iphone
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:11.840]   Might be worth doing. I like how when you swipe up the bottom posts kind of fly elegant. Yeah, it's a really nice
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:15.520]   It's a nice effect. It's so elegant. Look i'm watching a hangout right here
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:18.320]   That's exciting
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:21.200]   Uh, yeah, I think they've did a nice job of it. Anyway, that's uh
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.200]   That is the uh, somehow i've gotten a youtube. Oh, I that's because I joined a hangout
