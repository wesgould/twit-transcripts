[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   It's Diver Twig this week at Google. Matthew Ingram sits in for Stacey Higginbotham, Jeff Jarvis and Aunt Prudha here.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   A special treat, a visit from Trey Rakcliffe, our favorite photographer. He's going to talk about NFTs.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And what they mean to the creator, then we'll talk about Google's empathy lab,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Flock, and why that's a terrible idea, the reinvention of Twitter, which is underway right now,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   and the fourth anniversary of the most famous Skype call of all time.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Stacey's got the day off again, but Matthew Ingram is here so glad to have him,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Chief Digital Writer at the Columbia Journalism Review.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Hello, Matthew.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Hello.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Matthew's coming in via LTE from Canada.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So that's too strong.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Sorry about the quality.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   No, it's okay.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   You know, your sound is fine and that's really all that matters.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   We're working on different things.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   In fact, with Jeff Jarvis today, we're trying Zoom.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   It's something he's actually, you know what?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   The color's better.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Everything looks better in Zoom.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I'm not so pink.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Yeah, you look good.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Jeff--
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Well, I've had to go a little too far, but at least I'm not too pink.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   At first, I said, "Oh, let's not experiment with Jeff."
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   But they pointed out, "You live in Zoom."
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Because of--
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I do indeed.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   All year, you teach in Zoom.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I'm used to it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   We've been trying different alternatives to Skype.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I fear that Skype is fading away.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Zoom is-- I'm going to jinx this right now, but Zoom has been really quite amazing.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It was great.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It was quite amazing and reliable for me.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yeah, it looks great.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And that he's-- except for John, easy to use.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Sorry, John.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Poor John.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   He'll learn.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I couldn't get in.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   He'll learn.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   He'll learn.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Also with us, Aunt Pruitt, on line four.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   We've not used line four in a while.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   How you doing, Aunt?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Unbelievable as always, sir, yourself.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I'm great.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's good to see you.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And the reason, Aunt's on line four is because on line one today--
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Special guest.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   --a special guest.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Just for a few minutes, we're going to say hello to Trey Radcliffe.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Ooh.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   He's down in New Zealand, where there are count them zero, zero COVID cases.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Hi, Trey.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Hey, what's going on?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Yeah, there's zero COVID cases, but eight million sheep.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   No, there is no connection.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   No.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   No connection.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Trey has been living down under--
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So, so.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   --for-- you call it down under, even though it's in New Zealand, not Australia, right?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Or no?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It's Anzac.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yeah, people refer to it like that.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Mostly down under means Aussie land where you don't like to mix for those.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Trey is an official Kiwi, has been for a decade now, which is great.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Moved from Austin.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I remember you're Austin Days, and I remember when you moved, and you're very happy in
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Queenstown, right?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yeah, moved here 10 years ago for a variety of reasons, you know.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   But actually on the list, somewhere down there was just in case of global thermonuclear war
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   or pandemic.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And pandemic one.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Thank goodness.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   You played that.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So, I want to talk-- we brought Trey on, and of course, Trey's an old friend.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Great photographer, one of the best in the world, I'm sure, as you will vouch.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Ant-Pruit, Ant-Says, he's been stalking you for years.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And Trey used to--
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Yes, I said that on there.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Yeah, used to do a show on the network.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   He's up it on many times.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   We've done triangulations with him, if you want to learn more about Trey.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   But the reason to bring you on is because you sent me an email the other day.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I said, "Here's an NFT of one of my images."
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And I was so taken with that.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I said, "Let's get Trey on because we have been trying Trey for a month to figure out
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   what the hell these non-fungible tokens are.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And if anybody should know, it's you."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You're not the first artist to do this.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   In fact, this has been, I think, mostly a boon for artists.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   No, I'm not the first.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I found out about it the first time, like two years ago, I have a friend named Yash, who
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   was one of the founders of Pinterest.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And he actually came out here to Queenstown, New Zealand, came here into the studio and
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   was telling me all about NFTs and how big they're going to be.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Two years ago.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And I said, "I don't really understand."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   So he just explained it to me for hours like, "Okay, I get it."
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   So I almost did it way back then.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   But I thought, "Well, sometimes it's not good to be an early adopter.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Sometimes it is."
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   But now I think the wave of interest is so high that it's probably the right time to get in.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Grimes got a lot of attention for selling $5.8 million of her art.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Digital art.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.600]   A lot of it animated.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.000]   I think all of it animated for 20 minutes, almost $6 million to 20 minutes.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   The National Basketball Association, the NBA's made $200 million selling basketball highlights
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   at NBATopshot.com.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   The first time I became aware of what now we call NFTs was CryptoKitties, which was a
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   site you would use a cryptocurrency, I guess Bitcoin at the time, to buy these digital
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.760]   cats that would mate.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.360]   But Trey, it's kind of speculation, really.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.800]   I mean, because there's no tangible good.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.280]   If I have one of your pictures on my wall at home, that's a tangible good.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.760]   Not necessarily one of a kind, but it's a thing, a physical thing.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.240]   You're not selling when you sell an NFT of your art.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.680]   You're not selling the print, are you?
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.680]   Or are you?
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.880]   No, but you can.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   You can attach real life goods to your NFT.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.480]   But you don't need to.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.680]   Or send someone a link in the Skype chat.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:38.680]   Like this guy made some shoes and you can, it's like a digital shoe that spins around.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.120]   But then like if you buy it, you also get the real shoe.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.400]   And I think in 24 hours, he made about $3 million.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.800]   Oh my God.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   Jesus.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:56.400]   And, Trey, can you restrict, can you put conditions in the contract about what the owner does
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.320]   and does not get?
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.800]   Yes.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.960]   You can put that in the contract because you know it's a smart contract tied to the Ethereum
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.960]   blockchain.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.200]   So you can put the parameters in there.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.440]   You can really do almost anything that you like.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.080]   You can do, you can put it up for an auction.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.960]   So there's one of one.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.560]   You can put up a photo or a piece of art.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.440]   That's an open edition.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.960]   And you put a price on it.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.440]   And if it sells 560 units, then those 560 things are minted.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.040]   And then it's all that will ever be minted with that particular piece of art.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.480]   There's lots of different schemes and scenarios for selling stuff.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.800]   I think this is, there's, so you said the speculation.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.760]   It's totally speculation.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.760]   And I,
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   Although here's my.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.280]   Fair, so I'm buying Starry, Starry Night by Pits of Van Gogh.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.760]   If you buy as an investment instead of just something pretty to put on the wall.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.640]   And I think that's where most fine art is sold as an investment.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.200]   You're speculating it'll be more valuable in the years to come.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   Right.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.120]   And I think that they're right to speculate on it because right now there's so many Bitcoin
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.120]   millionaires out there.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.120]   There's just all the, the call with them.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.640]   And people don't know, right now people buy Bitcoin and they just play the market.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.480]   You know, the way you're going to go up 4% or down 3%.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.200]   You know, it's like trading the euro for the yen.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   And that's a little boring.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   It's much more interesting to buy instead of having an invisible Bitcoin to have like
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.000]   a digital piece of art.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And the art, there's a secondary and tertiary market so it gets sold and resold.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.360]   So why wait for Bitcoin to go up 3% when you could buy a piece of art?
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.640]   They'll jump up 50% in a few weeks.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:39.160]   So is it, you think it's the case that people who are spending money on NFTs are not taking
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.480]   dollars, say, and turning it into Bitcoin or Ethereum and then spending it?
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.680]   This is stuff they've had.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.800]   They have in their wallet.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.280]   And so it's just like buying more crypto.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.880]   It's what it sounds like.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   It's kind of like that.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880]   Right.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   Okay.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.960]   They're probably sitting on hundreds of thousands or millions in Bitcoin and have a Coinbase
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960]   account.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.200]   And then these NFT sites, they often use this little wallet called Metabask.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.280]   So they can just convert it to Ethereum, send it to their Metabask wallet and they can
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.080]   just go stir crazy and buy all kinds of stuff.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.680]   Is it usually Ethereum when you're doing an FTE?
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:23.960]   That's actually good news because Ethereum is not nearly so energy dependent as Bitcoin
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.440]   is, right?
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.000]   I've been told somebody said, somebody said, Leo, you're an idiot.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.320]   It's don't worry about it.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.720]   Because I was complaining, actually, I was quoting Seth Gooden who did a blog post saying,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.240]   the only thing bad with NFTs is it's going to hasten climate change because there's
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.640]   so much energy involved in these transactions.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.800]   But that's not the case with Ethereum.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.160]   I don't totally understand the mechanics of Ethereum, but I do know that it can do a
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.880]   lot more transactions.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.400]   And there's new with the new Ethereum, Ethereum 2.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.320]   They've got a lot of different wild computer science techniques that are happening that
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.560]   can, you know, makes it like 10,000 times as efficient as Ethereum 1.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.560]   That's proof of stake is less energy intensive than proof of work, which is--
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.920]   And the main reason Ethereum was developed was to do smart contracts like NFTs.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.920]   Right.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.920]   Okay.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:25.320]   So I think it's a really interesting time because crypto has always been very esoteric
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.560]   for the common person.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.560]   Yes.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.760]   This does not make it any less--
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.560]   I gotta be honest.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.560]   Right.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560]   This just makes it even crazier.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.560]   Wow.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.600]   It's like the bubbles in it.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.120]   People that buy all these NBA cards and all this kind of stuff.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.680]   So these are like regular people.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.360]   And so now there's, you know, non-computer science nerds like us that are getting into
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.720]   this collecting stuff.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.440]   So it's entering a certain zeitgeist.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.160]   It's still early, but it's nice to see so many people playing the game.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   It's just a game.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.120]   It does remind me that trading cards.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.680]   It is very much like that.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.520]   In fact, that's what Seth Codden used the, the Haunas Wagner.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.320]   A card, of which there are only 10 is an example.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.800]   You know, that piece of cardboard has no intrinsic value.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.000]   Or Superman one.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.400]   I mean, I guess if you're a Superman fan or if there's any Haunas Wagner fans left,
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.320]   because he played 100 years ago, you could say, well, he's a fan.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.760]   But really, that's not why people buy Haunas Wagner baseball cards.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.280]   They buy it because of its intense value.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.480]   And they spend millions on the, of real money on these things.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.720]   You trade using it.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.960]   Well, you're the banana.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.960]   Sorry.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.840]   Go ahead, Matt.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.240]   I was just, you remember the fine art, fine art?
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.200]   It was a banana tape to the wall by an artist.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   Remember that?
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   Yep.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   Yep.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   Which is.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   And another performance artist, Aiden.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.960]   Do you remember that?
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.200]   I remember that too.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.880]   And then, yeah.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.280]   And so that was his art was to eat the banana.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.680]   But part of the contract for buying the banana tape to the wall was that the banana would
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.760]   be regularly replaced by the carrier.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.160]   So it's okay to eat it.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   I guess.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:11.000]   The banana, by the way, was priced at $120,000.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.240]   Mauricio Catalan, he titled it Comedian.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.160]   And then along, another comedian to eat it.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.120]   This is part of art basil in Miami Beach.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.080]   So trade, you see yourself as selling your goods, your images this way entirely, or is
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.560]   this just kind of a fun little sideline?
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.440]   It's a fun experiment.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.000]   I still sell big prints.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.440]   People want them on the wall, right?
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.680]   This sounds a little name dropy.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.760]   You guys know I don't tell you myself seriously.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:52.280]   But I did have two famous celebrities become collectors lately.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.360]   Edward Norton and Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.360]   Nice.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.360]   Nice.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.360]   Wow.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.360]   It is name dropping.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.040]   If it were me, I'd do it the same.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.680]   Do you guys hang out?
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.280]   Oh, Trey has introduced me some major celebrities.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.160]   Hans Zimmer is a friend.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.440]   The last time you were in Petaluma, you came here with MySpaceTom and we went out for Korean
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.440]   tacos.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.440]   Wow.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.200]   So everybody famous I know, I know through Trey.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   He knows every minute.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.440]   I met Hans Zimmer.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.440]   I didn't meet him.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.440]   He's been home.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.440]   Trey's friends with Hans Zimmer.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.440]   Trey's like his buddy.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.440]   Right?
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.440]   Yeah, well, nice.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.600]   His friends we travel run together.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:37.480]   I wanted to ask from the standpoint of the artist that's a starving artist and happens
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:45.080]   to be able to make a sale of an NFT, what is it from a payment standpoint?
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.080]   I mean, are we talking real money that actually shows up or is it just going to sit somewhere
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.480]   in a crypto wallet somewhere that they have to sit on forever and ever and just buy more
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.480]   crypto based items?
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.400]   Good question.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.640]   Yeah, I'd explain how it works.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:07.200]   So you take a piece of art, it can be a photo, it can be music, it can be animated or whatever.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.400]   You upload it to one of these marketplaces like the one I'm going to put mine on first
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.520]   any day now is one called Makers Place.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.280]   And then so you upload it just like you're uploading a picture to Flickr or whatever,
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.200]   any very little description.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.800]   You put how you want to sell it, what kind of price.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.520]   And then it goes live.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:33.400]   For example, the way that the money works is, let's say they buy it for $1,000.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:39.320]   Makers Place takes 15% and 85% goes to the original artist.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.800]   So that's really quite good.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.240]   That's better than the usual calorie commission, right?
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   Right.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.040]   As soon as someone buys it, that money is transferred into your Coinbase account or
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   your MetaMask wallet.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.160]   And then you can convert that to US dollars anytime.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.080]   So you can cash it in.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.240]   Yeah, even better because it's a smart contract.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.000]   If someone buys that on Makers Place and then they resell it, the original artist gets
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.680]   10% of every subsequent sale.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.520]   Oh, so brilliant.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.000]   You'll get 10% loyalty on that piece.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   So I can see your interest in this for the artist.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.200]   This is a great deal.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   Oh boy.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   Makers Place, huh?
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   Hmm.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   No.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   You can see the gears turning.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.960]   Makers Place is digital.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.320]   These are digital art.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.440]   And that's one of the things I think that confuses people about NFTs.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.320]   As I said, I got from you, I still have it.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.080]   This a picture of the space shuttle launch.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.320]   It's beautiful.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.160]   And that's a physical thing.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.160]   It's probably a print.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.800]   So there may be other copies of it.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.080]   That's very common these days.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.240]   But you know, you may also, if you have a Van Gogh, you might have the original.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.880]   A digital thing, the thing that confuses me is you can make infinite copies.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:04.120]   Does Makers Place prevent you from making infinite copies of the art you just bought?
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.320]   They have a pretty tight authentication process.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.320]   Okay.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.320]   Right.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.240]   Because when it's authenticated in the blockchain, it trays the original creator.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.240]   Only 20 exist or only one exist.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.240]   But it's digital.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.280]   How can they keep me from making another copy?
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.440]   I don't understand.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:29.400]   Well, technically, I could take the same photo and upload it on another site.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   True.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   Like foundation.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.560]   So there's a certain amount of trust.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.360]   It's a great way.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.440]   But there's ways they can check the Ethereum blockchain to see if the same thing's already
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.600]   out there.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.760]   So that's why it's just so trusted.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:49.320]   And the mind flip that people have to go through is, you know these, you've all know
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:57.040]   a Harari books like Sapiens that things only have about humans are the only animal on the
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.800]   planet that believe in fictions.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.320]   You know, and if we all believe, we believe in a lot of fictions as it turns out.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   Like money.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.320]   You can't see a meter.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.880]   You can't weigh it, but we all agree on how big a meter is.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.520]   So then we can use such a big stuff.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.520]   Right.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.720]   To say the thing with money and now the same thing with digital art.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.000]   And you can see so many people are buying it that there's enough people that believe
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.320]   in it, just to keep it going.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.880]   Same thing I was Bitcoin.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.400]   People didn't know we got to get more and more people to believe in this story.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.080]   But now so many people believe in that story.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.880]   The story grows.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.120]   You could put code into the image too, right?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:38.880]   Like sort of stegenography or you could insert something into the actual image itself.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.880]   But that'd be copy.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.880]   Yeah, you can add to you.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:46.640]   If I copy bit for bit, the thing I bought that's going to be copied with a bit for bit.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.800]   Technically you can go screenshot my photos anytime and make them your screen saver or
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   whatever background.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.440]   But there's only one that exists in the Ethereum blockchain and it's authenticated.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.440]   That's the real one.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.440]   Okay, I get it.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.440]   Right.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440]   Yeah, that's the real one.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.440]   Wow.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.440]   It's sort of interesting.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:22.880]   Ray, what's interesting is that besides pictures, images, which are physical objects as well
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:30.200]   as digital objects, you do something that's fully digital at this machine elf site.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.600]   These are kind of videos.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.960]   You actually post them on YouTube so people can see them on YouTube.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.640]   Do you plan to sell these at some point?
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.320]   We actually have a company down here with four people and we're going to be cranking out
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.960]   probably 60 or 70 a year.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.560]   And right now we have a licensing deal through a company called Trip.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.560]   They make VR headsets.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:00.080]   So you bet to be better in a VR, obviously, be better in a VR headset.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.600]   Am I violating your copyright by playing this?
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.200]   Are you going to assume me?
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.200]   No.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   Okay.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.240]   That's cool, man.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.000]   I'm a little gun shy these days.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.560]   That's another thing to point out, right?
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.680]   I mean, frequently our podcasts get taken down because we're playing somebody else's
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.840]   copy of material to talk about it, which I deems fair use doesn't matter.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   So it gets taken down.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.840]   Use.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.320]   So, you know, this is, you know, it's quite so interesting.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.560]   I figured if everybody used it to this would be you, Trey.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.480]   Yeah, it's all made out of math.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.480]   It's all made out of fractals.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.480]   That's my background.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.920]   But we're building an app for iPad and stuff, not really because it'll be look nice in the
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.080]   iPad, but we want to have it ready for apples of the art kit.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   Yes.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.120]   Because I think they're going to be really cool.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.360]   And of course they'll be showing off games and all that good stuff.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:02.280]   And meditation, these are really visual meditations is, you know, a multi-billion dollar market,
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.920]   you know, common head space or two billion dollar companies.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.120]   So we're kind of the first to have visual and audio meditations.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.040]   And you know, it'd be kind of cool maybe for one of the featured things because people
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   get tired of playing games or just want to lay on the couch and veg out and relax.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.840]   Do I have to take ayahuasca to do it or is, can I just do it?
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.840]   It helps.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   It helps.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   It helps.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   It wouldn't hurt.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   It wouldn't hurt.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:32.240]   What makes you think that apples VR is going to be the business, if you will, versus what
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.480]   is currently out there now from the lights of Microsoft.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.440]   I think because they're so good with style and they're going to look cool and all these
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.920]   famous people are going to be using it.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.760]   You're going to see football players on the side, on the bench, Marine, the gawk, just
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.880]   like the ear pods that roll out.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.600]   You see famous people and stars and sports stars using this, you're like, oh, I want
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.880]   to be cool like them.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.080]   So they'll make it cool.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.000]   So there's just this apple effect.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   That's on the night.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.520]   I better but they'll at least make it more.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.600]   They may not make it better, but they'll make it a little bit more socially acceptable,
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   perhaps.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.320]   It'll be light.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.920]   It maybe last five hours.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.520]   You can take it in the car.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.960]   I think they'll do it right.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.400]   I love hate relationship with that company, but I think they'll do that right.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.880]   Right.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.120]   Interesting.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.400]   Is there sound with these machine elves?
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.400]   There is, right?
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   I have a...
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   Why am I not...
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.400]   My business partner's composer.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.720]   So he composes custom music for it.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:41.280]   And then what's kind of cool is because these fractals are based on math, I can take his
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.440]   music and make it one of the inputs for the coefficients.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.880]   So the colors will change perfectly or the shapes will flex with the sound.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.720]   So it's a very trippy experience.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.200]   Did you develop it?
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.320]   Let's all just watch for a few minutes and see if we feel better.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.880]   Do you have the music now, John?
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   Oh.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.880]   Oh.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.880]   You're all in a little hoop.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   No, John.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:16.240]   This is straight out of my 18-year-old acid trip college life right here.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.600]   That's amazing.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.360]   And because they're fractals, we're just showing little clips from your sight, but these are
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.640]   a bunch longer and you kind of dive into them.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.360]   I've actually seen quite a few of these.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   I love these.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.680]   Trey, where does the math come from?
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.960]   Do you generate it yourself or...?
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.480]   They're pretty much all the fractals are pretty well known out there.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.480]   They're made by like...
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.640]   Like the Mandelbrot sets and so forth.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.680]   Yeah, in the '50s and '60s.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:48.840]   So I use a program called Mandel Bulber, which is incredibly esoteric and difficult to use.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.960]   I took you like six months to figure out how to use it.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.480]   And then so you can take, you know, any one of 100 fractals and you...
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.640]   So you combine a fractal that was made by some Austrian mathematician in 1960 with one
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.240]   that was here from German mathematician 1970 and they merged together and create something
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.560]   totally new and you can change the parameters over time that it extrapolates and builds
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.560]   just beautiful things.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.640]   Yeah, fractals are one of the things you do early in your programming career.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.760]   It's a good way to teach recursion.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.800]   And nobody owns a fractal, right?
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.560]   Nobody owns like the algorithm or the...
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.320]   No, Beno and Mandelbrot owns it.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.320]   No, it's a formula.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.760]   You want to hear my fractal joke?
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.760]   Sure.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.440]   So Benoie, Mandelbrot's mental initial is B. Do you know what it stands for?
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.440]   Benoie, Mandelbrot.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.440]   Good one.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.440]   Good one.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.440]   We only play fractals.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.440]   Yes.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.440]   Yes.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.440]   Let me play a full...
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.600]   Not a full length one, but a bit...
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.280]   Because these are like half an hour long, but instead of the show reel, let me just play
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.960]   an individual one, just so you can get a sense of how it kind of...
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.440]   You go into it, you dive into it.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:05.520]   And again, these are available on Trace YouTube channel.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.480]   So the music is Sam Wave, is that his name?
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.720]   Yeah, Sam Wave.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.240]   So you see, we're going...
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.520]   We're going to go into this thing.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:19.280]   And one of the properties of fractals is that as you dive into a fractal, the fractal
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   repeats, so it doesn't...
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.440]   Resolution doesn't disappear.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.680]   You don't ever finish.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.400]   You just go deeper and deeper.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.400]   You are now...
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.880]   You are now going deep into...
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.120]   Ooh, these are fun.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.120]   These are fun.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.440]   You don't really need to take anything to really kind of trip out on these.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.440]   Good.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.240]   I like it.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.000]   Either trip out or find your center.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.960]   So I could see you selling these ZnFTs as well, although I think you...
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.800]   They're a wider audience, right?
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.760]   Yeah, I think we probably will cut them up and sell them with NFTs.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.760]   Why not?
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.960]   People seem to like animated stuff.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.960]   You know?
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.800]   And these are 15, 20 minutes long, and a typical NFT is 15 to 30 seconds long.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.960]   And so, yeah, we'll see how they do.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.560]   They're already made, you know?
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.960]   So why not chop them up and give it a run?
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   I have to stop now because there are people who are driving while they listen to the show.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.360]   They're trying to fall off the side of the road.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.360]   It's really nice.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.360]   That does it up there.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.840]   They're really amazing.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:36.520]   And I have spent far too many hours in your machine elf.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.720]   You're doing a podcast now?
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.640]   You want to tell us a little bit about that?
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.920]   I have a couple different podcasts.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:49.160]   One, I walk around with a 360 camera outside with a frown.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.440]   I did one with Kevin Kelly.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.160]   We just talk about stuff.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.160]   I love that one.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.480]   Are you going to do more of those?
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.680]   Because I love that.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.120]   And then the new one is audio.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.120]   It's called Molecules I've Ingested.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:09.880]   And each episode is a different drug, like a hilarious story, but also very educational
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.920]   and interesting.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:16.840]   So the one I just released is Molecules I've Ingested, Ayahuasca and Hitler.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.640]   Oh, man.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:23.040]   Is Hitler like an appearance in the Ayahuasca trip?
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   I don't know.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.040]   You just have to hear the whole story.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.040]   I don't know if I'd want that.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.040]   Oh, boy.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.040]   I don't know if I'd want that.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.640]   I thought Hitler was a good drug.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.640]   Maybe he was the shop.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.640]   The kids were taking.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.640]   Hitler's the shaman?
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   No.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:39.760]   Podcasts.trayraccliffe.com is trades a podcast hub.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:47.040]   If you are interested in the machine elf, it's the-machine-elf.com.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.400]   And I highly recommend checking it out.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.600]   The Amazonian giant monkey frog poison, aka the cambo ceremony.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.400]   I think you told me about this one on triangulation, I think.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.400]   I'm not sure.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.400]   I can't believe it.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.240]   So I still have the mark up here for the poison winnid.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   Oh, geez.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.520]   Did you miss Burning Man this year?
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.520]   What are you going to do?
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.520]   Are you going to go?
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.360]   Is it going to be back in September?
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.000]   I bet it will be.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.840]   There's been no official announcement yet.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.360]   But last year it was off.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.720]   That was a bummer because I had gone 10 years in a row.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.720]   Sort of a nice pilgrimage.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.200]   And I get so inspired by the other artists there.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.280]   It just really kind of fills my cup.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.200]   But I know people are anxious to get back out there, especially everyone who's been so
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.200]   locked inside.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.560]   And yeah, I think it'll go on.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.880]   Trey, it's just you, I guess, because you always make me feel much more relaxed and better.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:46.000]   But now I'm much less antsy about FTS, but it might just be a temporary effect of having
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   a tray on the show.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.480]   We love talking to you.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.600]   I'm glad that you're doing so well.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.080]   I'm glad you're still making art.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.400]   You're still taking pictures, I hope.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.880]   I take pictures all the time.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.480]   And I feel so full of gratitude and lucky to be here in New Zealand so I can just kind
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.680]   of jump in the car and drive around and see beautiful things.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.480]   You live in the most beautiful area.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.240]   Oh my God.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.520]   Where can we find your photos?
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.440]   Same place, stuck in customs or?
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:21.840]   Well, probably the best is my smug mug site, which is stuck in customs dot smug mug.com.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:27.400]   And you get nice high quality versions there, plus you can buy prints and so forth, not
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   at NFT prices either.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.320]   Yeah, actually I don't sell prints on there.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.080]   Oh, you don't allow people to make prints?
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:41.280]   No, we, because we keep a really limited edition, like we might only do three big ones that
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.600]   have been sold out forever.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.760]   And they're kind of, they're a little higher price.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.720]   You know, it's, and we haven't printed it.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.240]   It's placed in Germany and it's a whole big deal.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.080]   It's a whole big procedure.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.480]   What do you, what do you use for software these days and hardware?
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.080]   I'm just always curious.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:06.680]   Um, I still use Aurora HDR from Skylem.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   Nice.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   Skylem.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   That's what I used to.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.680]   Well, disclosure, I help make it and all that stuff, but I actually use it every day.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:19.120]   Um, I've been flirting a little bit with Luminar, the new Luminar.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.120]   I, I've been pretty cool.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.080]   The AI is wild, isn't it?
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.760]   I'm, I'm so tempted to replace every sky and every photo I've ever taken with a much
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.760]   better one.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:35.400]   Uh, and Trey does have some, some Luminar filters, which are, cause it's Trey wild and
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.400]   fun.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.080]   Really great stuff.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.080]   Luminar is pretty cool.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.960]   Uh, actually I think they're just now adding that the reflect, the sky replacement also
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.320]   works and if there's a reflection, like in the water.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.560]   Um, I don't know.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.560]   These guys are real smart.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.440]   I don't do sky replacement because there, there could always be a better sky, you know?
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.960]   I know if I ever did it, people would say, oh, I know where that sky came from.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.560]   Cause I mean, it's pretty high.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.880]   It's not my sky.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.240]   So yeah, I'm very nervous.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:08.440]   But, but if you use Aurora HDR, you've, that program has saved some of some, some,
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.320]   some sort of grungy, drab pictures of mine and brought them to life.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   And it really is an amazing tool.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:19.400]   Uh, and I, and I actually bought a Luminar AI cause I'm very curious about, uh, what I
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   can do with it.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.400]   It's pretty cool.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.560]   Um, everybody should, should follow Trey.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   What else?
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.360]   Oh, a quick, funny story about sky replacement, a real short.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.000]   So, um, I'm friends with this Russian photographer named Dima and he's really good.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.720]   It tastes great photography, photography and landscapes, but he has this library of
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.800]   photos shot with like 5,000 moons.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   Okay.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   And they're big.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.160]   So he always puts these big moves in all of his photos all the time.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.440]   You know, with the photographer, you know, fake, but other people think like, Oh, that's
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.440]   pretty cool.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.520]   And I say, Dima, why do you always add moves to every one of your photos?
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.880]   He goes, it looks better with moon.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.880]   That's right.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.880]   He's right.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.080]   Trey does not have to add moons to his photos.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.640]   They look so gorgeous.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.640]   Look at this.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   That's amazing.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.640]   That's inspired me.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.040]   I have a folder of moons myself.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.040]   That's a stir.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.040]   That's right.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.040]   But if it looks good with one moon, why not put a couple in?
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.040]   I have.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.040]   Do you still are, I guess, have you not been traveling?
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.880]   Cause one of the things I always loved about your photos is the travel stuff.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.760]   No, I'm here, but it's been a great place to be stuck.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.040]   New Zealand, it's a lot bigger than people think.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.440]   And so it's been a lot of time up on the North Island.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.440]   How big is your town?
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.040]   It looks like it's got two streets on Google Maps.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.680]   It's a tiny seat.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.640]   It's a small, little one horse town.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.920]   I'll put it this way, Jeff.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.440]   It's half the size of Petaluma.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.920]   It's 25,000 people.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.920]   Wow.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   Wow.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.920]   Wow.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.920]   I thought the Luma is not a big city.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.920]   If I'm not wrong, I think.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.320]   And how did you pick that spot?
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.120]   Good news.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.000]   How did you pick that spot?
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.800]   Well, it's beautiful that the mountains, I feel really energetic here.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.600]   It's very outdoorsy.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.520]   Kiwis are really nice, but actually Queenstown is having a really tough time because of the
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.520]   pandemic.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.520]   Oh, no.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.440]   Cause it's 70% depending on tourism.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.960]   So it's a bit like minutes.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.200]   Cause it's a ski destination and all the outdoor stuff.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.600]   And they're depending on foreigners to come here and they're not.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.600]   I'm on my way.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.600]   I'll be there.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.600]   Quite tough.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.600]   You're right there.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.920]   Did you sell your house, by the way?
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:38.800]   You have, I had no idea that you were living in the most beautiful home I have ever seen.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.120]   Were you able to sell it yet or is it still for sale?
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.680]   No, I can't decide if I want to sell it or not.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   It's big.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   I don't blame you.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.560]   And you know, I got divorced two years ago.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.080]   So I just kind of rattle around inside of it.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.440]   And I thought about, and I'm a minimalist.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.200]   This is basically my little studio.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.840]   And I just stayed there.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.520]   But there's still a lot of people moving to New Zealand and it's really in demand.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.320]   So I thought, well, maybe I should not sell it.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   I can do that.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.880]   It's, it's so gorgeous.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.160]   I am, I am blown away when I see it.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.160]   Something you see in the magazine.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   It's like something you see in a magazine.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.480]   It's just so gorgeous.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.480]   Trey Radcliffe.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.480]   You guys are always talking to me.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.440]   I know, I know, and I've been meaning to come out and visit, but then this COVID thing
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   happened.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.240]   I'll see it maybe a few, a year or two.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.000]   It's always a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.480]   Trey Radcliffe, the-
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.480]   Make sure-
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   Make sure-
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:45.480]   at Trey Radcliffe on Twitter and of course, stuck in customs.smugmug.com for his portfolio.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.680]   It's amazing.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:48.680]   Have a wonderful day.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.680]   Wonderful.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.680]   I guess it's daytime now in New Zealand.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.680]   Thanks, Craig.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.680]   Almost lunchtime, right?
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.680]   Hey, guys.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.680]   Lunchtime on Thursday.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   He's a day ahead.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.680]   See you, Trey.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.680]   Bye.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.680]   Bye.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.960]   We're going to take a little break when we come back.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.120]   We've got the tech news and I'm just going to ream Sean Hannity.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.240]   I think you know what I'm talking about here if you don't.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.640]   No, I actually don't.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.640]   Oh my God.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.840]   Do you know about the Taylor Lawrence?
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   No, it wasn't Sean Hannity.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.840]   It was-
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.840]   No, it was Tucker Carlson.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.840]   Tucker Carlson.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.840]   Sorry.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   Tucker Carlson.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   I'm going to-
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.840]   So I reamed the wrong guy.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.840]   Well, actually probably not.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.840]   They both deserve it.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:34.160]   I am livid about this Tucker Carlson thing and we'll talk about that and a lot more in
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.000]   just a little bit.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.160]   Before I do though, I want to talk about our sponsor today.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.920]   We're brought to you by the Enterprise Tech 30.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:51.880]   Really exciting list of the top tech disruptors, the new startups, the companies that are about
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.560]   to change the world.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:59.120]   It's a piece of really amazing research comes to us from Wing Venture Capital in partnership
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.400]   with NASDAQ.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.000]   You know, I think, you know, as Roblox goes public today, I think when a company goes
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.840]   public, the world knows.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:15.080]   But there's a whole sector of not public yet private enterprise tech that is amazing,
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.600]   but it's basically opaque.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   You have no idea, you know, how the company's doing, you know, they're cagey.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:26.200]   They don't say what's going on with growth or revenue, sales cycles, especially for
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.160]   these new companies can be long and unpredictable.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.760]   There are lots of lists out there that feature startups or tech disruptors.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.920]   But I have to say I never trust these lists because, you know, there's lots of reasons
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.920]   not to trust them.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:46.280]   They're often dominated by well-known consumer brands or a B2B, maybe that's well-known.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:51.080]   There's also issues, you know, with lobbying and so forth, even pay to play in some of
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.360]   these lists.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.840]   So this is not that.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.880]   This is an absolutely editorially based, very good list.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.720]   The enterprise tech 30, enterprise startups, these are B2B startups that have the most
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.280]   potential to tectonically shift how enterprises operate for the better.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:14.000]   Awardees of the ET30 on a fast track of growth, they're changing how business is done.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.240]   Of course, they're expected to make an IPO at some point, multi-billion dollar exits,
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.240]   but they haven't yet.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.240]   That's the point.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.880]   You're getting in on the early, early stage.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.760]   It's not possible to lobby your way into the ET30.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.440]   You can only be selected by the editorial team.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.440]   The enterprise tech 30 focuses on companies with potential at all stages of maturity,
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.960]   not just startups, but not just mature businesses or not just businesses that you already heard
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.040]   of and know and have time, have traction.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.920]   And that's the beauty of this.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.200]   Consider it a buying guide for enterprise executives seeking to bring more validated
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.080]   and credible digital innovations to their organizations.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.240]   Enterprise tech founders should see inclusion as the highest endorsement of their current
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.240]   and future success.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.240]   I know they do.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.920]   Founders that aspire to build publicly traded companies should see inclusion as a watershed
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.680]   moment in their founders journey tech executives and high performance operators will use this
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.040]   list to help guide their decisions on what companies to join.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.680]   The brand new 2021 edition of the enterprise tech 30 is here brought to you by Wing Venture
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.640]   Capital and NASDAQ.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:23.560]   Head over to enterprise tech 30 enterprise tech 30 dot com to see who made this year's
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.120]   list.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.720]   That's enterprise tech 30 dot com.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.840]   We thank you to 30 Wing and NASDAQ for their support.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.920]   I just want to get this off my chest, but you know, we got two great journalists here.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.800]   You know, we got Jeff Jarvis teaches journalism.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.160]   By the way, I didn't give you the full credit.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   So let me do that.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.160]   The operatic credit.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.440]   Now he's the Leonard Taill professor for journalistic innovation at the credit.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.200]   Thank you, Mark.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.120]   My graduate school journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.680]   So you teach young people how to be good journalists.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:59.560]   And of course, Matthew Ingram, longtime journalist, but also chief digital writer at the Columbia
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.560]   journalism.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.560]   The Columbia journalism review for crying out loud.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.280]   So Taylor Lawrence, who by the way is fantastic.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.480]   She writes she's a tech reporter for the New York Times with a beat on social media.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.080]   We quote her all the time on the show almost weekly on this show.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.080]   She's really great.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   I quote her again.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.800]   She's got an article about something really cuckoo.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.200]   We're going to get to the other night.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.520]   This bimbo on Fox News.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:35.160]   Tucker Carlson says, Oh, Taylor apparently tweeted at some point, you know, Hey, I've
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   been harassed.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.160]   It's been hell.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.520]   It's ruined my life.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:43.480]   And this is a problem for all women on Twitter, all, all women in public view.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.200]   And I know it intimately.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.880]   I've seen it happen with friends and family.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:54.560]   And I know Taylor has been horribly harassed by these anonymous on the internet.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:40:01.560]   Tucker Carlson becomes one of these not anonymous by saying, Oh, she's privileged.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.240]   How dare she complain about being all her life was ruined.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.240]   What an ass.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:13.200]   Not only, not only is he wrong to criticize her for that, but he's bringing down infinitely
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.400]   more on her head.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   Oh, yes.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.400]   And he knows.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.480]   He's this is very well is joined in too.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.840]   So Glenn Greenwald said pretty much exactly the same thing.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:29.600]   Why are they all of a sudden picking on Taylor Lawrence?
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:37.280]   Of all because partly because they see her as someone who just writes about kids on Tumblr
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.400]   or whatever they don't they don't consider what she does to be real.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.760]   No, it's the worst misogyny.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.760]   Why her?
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:52.360]   Well, before Tucker Carlson had a famous episode where he interviewed Lauren Duka and she just
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.320]   cut him off at the knees and what's above the knees.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.320]   They want there anymore.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.280]   It was a great interview.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:04.960]   Lauren was at the time a columnist for Teen Boge and he said she should stick to writing
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.120]   about, you know, thigh high boots or some such thing.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:17.080]   And horrendous misogyny just like Pierce Morgan, who's mad because Megan wouldn't
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.080]   be.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.440]   This is related by the way to the somehow I don't understand how Tucker Carlson related
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:28.280]   this to the Oprah interview with Harry and Megan because I guess it's part of a larger
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.320]   tirade against privileged people complaining about how they're treated.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.320]   Right.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.320]   Right.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.320]   She's not a princess.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.040]   Taylor Lorenz is not in the royal family.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.360]   No, Megan's not a princess either, but that's another story for another there.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.840]   She's not she's a reporter.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:51.760]   She's a frontline reporter for a newspaper who is now going to be I can only imagine,
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.040]   you know, she was harassed before this.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.200]   That's that's where I'm uncomfortable.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.800]   This this should be this is where you get taken down.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:05.120]   This is this is where the marketplace should revolt against not just this guy, but Fox
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   News in general.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:11.480]   Well, I blame I blame Glenn Greenwald even more because Tucker nobody really believes
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:17.600]   with that guy says he's a complete clown, but Glenn Greenwald to say that she basically
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.560]   doesn't deserve to be complaining because she hasn't suffered real harassment is is
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.920]   him saying, you know, it's only harassment.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.720]   If I say it is or if it meets my test.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.240]   Well, but you're absolutely right.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.320]   This is this is something I'm hundreds to me.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:38.280]   Oh, yeah, I'm going to be doing more about this coming up.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.600]   I haven't done any publicly yet.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:45.840]   So but but we in media tell Facebook and Twitter to clean their houses.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:54.760]   We in media don't clean our own house and Merach and his minions are a cancer on democracy.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.920]   And the fact that Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, who you almost went after what the
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.960]   heck go after him to and the big lie and everything they do.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.520]   The reason I thought of Sean Hannity because his defense when he was sued for defamation
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.520]   was well, everybody knows everything I do is fiction.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.880]   Yeah, that works.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880]   That was Tucker.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.880]   Was that Tucker?
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.880]   Okay.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.880]   Yeah, I'm confusing the two.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:24.720]   I read the case equally the whole the whole argument was nobody nobody sees Tucker as a
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.280]   journalist and nobody believes that what he says is true.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:32.880]   So you can accept that all of the horrific minions of Tucker Carlson now who will be
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.920]   going after Taylor Lawrence, including by the way, threatening her life.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.280]   I mean, look, Brittany Wu, who's a regular on our show had to move her house because of
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.480]   gamergate.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:49.760]   It just stirs up the worst, the worst people in the world.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.200]   And they know it and they know it.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.200]   And they know it.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.840]   It's not this is not what happened in the insight.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.920]   Well, that's incitement.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.960]   And there was incitement against our democracy and from the highest of the government.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:05.600]   And there's incitement against these women who are are are are, you know, when I talk
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.960]   about how good the internet is, the thing I always have to say is I it's easy for me
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.480]   to say as a as an old white man.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:18.880]   And I don't get attacked nearly like women do and other people do, but they know what
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.960]   they're what they're what they're bringing.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.960]   And it's awful.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.960]   It's just awful.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:32.680]   But how any company can advertise next to this person, apart from the F in pillow nut job,
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.620]   every advertiser on earth should be leaving Fox News.
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:40.200]   Every journalist on earth should be saying that we won't appear on their air.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:45.320]   Every organization of journalists should cut them out.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:50.520]   The contact digital content text next gets money from Robert Merach online news association
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.000]   gets money from Robert Merach.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.520]   They should all be saying Fox News is shunned and shamed and is not among us.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:02.440]   And frankly, Glenn Greenwald, who left the intercept and is now doing a newsletter at
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.360]   sub stack should be shamed.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360]   He's gone.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.360]   No better.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.360]   Just as much.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.760]   I don't understand his worldview now at all.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.440]   But I have to say Glenn Greenwald's writing a little corner of the world that has almost
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:21.960]   zero impact compared to Tucker Carlson, who I mean, people don't understand.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:32.720]   But TV has this huge emotional power and wielding it irresponsibly like that is for no good
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.720]   reason.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.200]   It's not even like there's this on TV is authoritative.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.440]   But there's no, but for him to say that is completely gratuitous.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.160]   It's like, let me just let me just pick somebody and beat them up just to show how much power
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160]   I have.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:52.240]   It's this it's this it's this cancel culture BS where she's not allowed to say that she's
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.480]   a victim because I am the only victim.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.720]   We are the only victims.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.880]   The poor put upon right wing media of Fox News.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.880]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.760]   People are trying to cancel us and they're getting rid of Dumbo and and Dr. Seuss and
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:11.680]   Mr. Potato Head never mentioned that 500,000 Americans are now dead, never put it in that
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:12.680]   context.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.200]   There I said this on the show before, but I say it again.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.000]   I go back to Hannah around.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.720]   What's happens in her totalitarian regime is that is that people give up their daily concerns
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.800]   for an abstract notion that they can rally behind.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:31.400]   So they rally behind not death, not about people's incomes in a pandemic.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:36.920]   They rally behind Mr. Potato Head and cancel culture and those are made up things.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   They don't exist.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.440]   They exist to try to make people mad.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.080]   And that's the power that Tucker Carlson has.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:49.760]   He demonstrates it as did Donald Trump by stirring people up by inciting this.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.680]   And it's a moral.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:57.360]   You feel better?
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:05.440]   No, you really, you really should not.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:12.400]   I mean, look, the job journalists do, we carry some responsibilities.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.000]   And this guy has been given a very powerful weapon and he's misusing it against another
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.960]   journalist, which is just offensive as hell.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.440]   Actually he's not a journalist.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.960]   I don't know who's there.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:29.680]   Nobody takes Tucker Carlson seriously, except they should because the guy is a menace to
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.680]   society.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:36.720]   So I've been on MSNBC's air, asking them to do something that we're going to do.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:37.720]   And Matthew, we need to talk about this.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.720]   How do we get this done?
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:42.960]   I'm talking to somebody actually Monday about this idea is we need somebody to start a feature
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.680]   that I call we watch Fox News so you don't have to.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:55.760]   And what I want is a view of what is your uncle Joe being fed and not being fed against
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:00.840]   MSNBC and CNN and the New York Times and the rest of liberal media.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.680]   Okay, fine.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:07.120]   But there's a skewed worldview that's being presented that I don't want to watch, but
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.120]   I want to understand what it is.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:14.640]   And media don't, except for Matthew and Brian Stelter, that's about it.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.120]   Media don't cover media.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.400]   And media especially Berdock is part of the story now.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.400]   Yeah, it is.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.560]   It probably feels a little too self-referential.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.880]   I understand that.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:30.200]   And normally, honestly, on this show, I wouldn't be talking about this except that I take it
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   personally.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.360]   I mean, that's really offensive.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.040]   She's a tech reporter.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:41.080]   She's not a privileged person and she's going to suffer the fires of hell probably for the
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.680]   rest of her life now, thanks to this asshole.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:48.720]   I mean, he's a talk radio flow hard just like Sean Hannity.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.720]   It's the worst.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   So really, and yeah, you could blame Rupert Murdoch for it, but I guess you could also
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.880]   blame Rush Limbaugh a little bit for it because he created it and drove that train to great
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.880]   success.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.880]   Yes.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:08.200]   And if you look at, I think it's, you've got Ben Claire talks about, you know, we're seeing
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:16.040]   the sort of terrible payoff of basically 50 years of this type of stuff has just become
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.040]   more and more mainstream and Rush Limbaugh effectively started most of it.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.760]   He was loathsome number of people said, come on, you're going to say something about his
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   passing.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.760]   Aren't you?
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:29.760]   Absolutely.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:30.760]   No, no circumstances.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:31.760]   No.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.800]   Because you don't want to hear what I would have to say about his past.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:34.960]   That's about time.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:39.120]   Well, I work so the radio company I work for was his syndicator.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.120]   Oh, really?
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.920]   Yeah, which always made me a little uncomfortable.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:48.640]   They syndicate a lot of, right, but if you're in talk radio, as my radio show is in talk
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.600]   radio, you're surrounded by those people.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.800]   That's what talk radio is being on.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.960]   Thanks to the success of.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:59.720]   So I called into Howard Stern a week ago and I said I had a theory that if Howard had
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:06.800]   not been hounded off of broadcast radio that maybe we wouldn't have ended up with Trump.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:12.520]   But what I meant by that was that there would have been an alternative for all the young
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:17.920]   men of America on radio, somebody other than right wing radio.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.840]   He was talking about poop instead of politics.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.840]   Exactly.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.840]   Howard said, no, I think that's wrong.
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.840]   And that was the end of the call.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:30.080]   Matthew, let me ask you a question if I can.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.080]   I was part of an original meeting that led to this.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:38.800]   And I think it's great that CJR has ambids people independent of these publications for
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.960]   the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:47.080]   Do you have any insight into why Fox wasn't added to that at CJR?
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.080]   I don't really.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:55.160]   I mean, I wasn't part of those discussions, but I assume it's along the lines of, you
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.160]   know, nobody trusts them anyway.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:03.160]   I mean, it's not as though they're going to take our advice in any way or pretend that
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.320]   they have a similar standard.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.760]   So it's kind of not worth it.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.800]   But I do think we've got a report on what they do.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:13.480]   So I say Brian Stelter, CNN wrote a book and he's got a new edition of his book coming
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.480]   out.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:19.240]   But Merbock is a malign actor.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:23.560]   His people are malign actors in our democracy, in our society, in our culture.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.560]   We've got to.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.880]   We can't just sit and do it.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:32.640]   I also would recommend to folks Kevin Rudd, the former, so we should, a neighbor of trays,
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.360]   the former prime minister of Australia two weeks ago during the whole Facebook thing,
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:43.360]   gave testimony to the Australian Senate in an effort to get a royal commission investigating
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:46.160]   media monopoly, read Murdoch.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.240]   And it's brilliant.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:53.880]   It is an hour of gripping video in which Rudd ends saying to the politicians there, the
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:58.840]   senators up on the on the dais, let's be honest with each other, we're all frightened
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.840]   of Murdoch.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.560]   He said I was frightened of Murdoch when I was prime minister.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:05.080]   We're all frightened of Murdoch and that shouldn't be.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:10.520]   And you look at the UK, Tom Watson, former MP, tried to go after Murdoch and now he's
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.520]   out of parliament.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.720]   Yeah, Murdoch, but he, two of the biggest tech companies in the world, Google and Facebook.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:19.040]   So I guess maybe you should be afraid.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.440]   Because he controls the government.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.960]   Yeah, he controls the government.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.960]   Exactly.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.160]   By the way, the book that Matthew mentioned by Johann Beckler is called Network Propaganda.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:29.680]   I read his wealth of networks book.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.680]   He's good.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:35.040]   He's really a deep thinker and it's nice to have him.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:44.440]   NYU study, cybersecurity for democracy, studying online misinformation, came up with the unsurprising
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:52.280]   conclusion related to this story that right wing misinformation is just more popular.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.280]   People like it better.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.200]   But, you know, Leo, I put this on here.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.240]   And what struck me about that is I think that the presumption we make is, oh, right
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:05.040]   wing propaganda gets more engagement because that's what Facebook does to people.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.120]   I think it's much more complicated than that, much harder to solve than that.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:12.280]   And so we think that the intervention is get Facebook to do it less.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:14.680]   No, people who want it will seek it out.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.680]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:16.680]   We'll engage with it.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:17.680]   That's quite passionate.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.480]   That's just the societal thing.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:26.240]   Well, and it's not, I mean, the proof is look what happened to talk radio.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.040]   Completely independently of Facebook.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:35.880]   And as soon as Rush Limbaugh and the other far right talkers like Michael Savage gone on
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.520]   and ratings went through the roof, they just took over talk radio.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.040]   And there is a reason ratings go through the roof.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.040]   I've listened.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.720]   Remember, Air America, the left wing alternative?
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.120]   I was a regular on it.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.680]   It wasn't compelling.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:49.680]   It was whippy.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.440]   Liberals are like, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.120]   They just not interesting.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:03.440]   There is the fire and brimstone of the right wing preacher that just somehow grabs you
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:07.160]   when liberals are going, well, we really have to consider the feelings of people.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.440]   And it's just not compelling.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.440]   I understand.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.680]   I don't talk radio and I understand.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:19.800]   I don't want to fall in the abyss of far right radio, but I'm surrounded by it.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:24.880]   But when you think about it, and this applies to Facebook too, anger is one of the most
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:25.880]   powerful emotions.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:26.880]   Outrage.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.880]   And outreach, you can.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.880]   Yes.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.880]   Right.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:34.840]   And if you can encourage people to feel anger towards someone that they blame for their
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:40.760]   problems or the problems of the world, then you will get an audience as simple as that.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.040]   Patty Chavsky told us that in network.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:49.040]   I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:53.000]   We've known this as long as there's been mass media.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.080]   And apparently it extends not to just a mass media, but social media just as well.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:03.400]   In fact, I would say Facebook and Twitter really are just expert at disseminating outrage.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.360]   I mean, it's the outrage of the minute, just constantly.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:15.440]   Well, I remember an interview with a newsfeed, a former Facebook newsfeed product manager,
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:19.760]   and he said, what Facebook cares about is engagement.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.240]   And you know what's really engaging?
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.240]   Yeah, facts.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   I guess you could also explain conspiracy theories.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.280]   They're somehow engaging.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.160]   It's back to the beginnings of our business.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:40.880]   Watch out Gutenberg moment coming before the first newspapers, broad sheets and news pamphlets
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.280]   with the primary news and ballads, singers and news singers.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.960]   And what was one of the primary topics besides war?
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:47.960]   What?
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:48.960]   Witch hunts.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:53.560]   Yeah, we love witches and people got people got you want to talk about cancel culture?
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.560]   Come to think of it.
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:01.480]   The Salem Witch Trials are a perfect example of this kind of mass hysteria.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.480]   How interesting.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.480]   Wow.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.520]   So it's human.
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.440]   It's a human failing.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.240]   Fray-alty that gets exploited.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.240]   Yes.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.880]   I guess there's I mean, what are you going to do if it's if it's a human?
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.920]   It's like saying, well, don't eat fat food, fatening foods.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:21.920]   Right.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:22.920]   Exactly.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:23.920]   What we like.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:24.920]   Well, it's it's at the end of the day.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:25.920]   It's education.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:26.920]   It's humanities.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.760]   But can you teach empathy?
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.640]   I think so, yeah.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.640]   Can you?
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:35.640]   I think you can.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.400]   I think you can encourage it.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.360]   And for some reason, I feel like empathy is the root of it.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:47.920]   If you could teach people to walk a mile in the other guy's shoes, then they wouldn't
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.840]   be so hateful towards the other guy.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:50.840]   That's right.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.240]   I do have a conversation today.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.240]   Go ahead, Ant.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.760]   No, I'll say I think so too.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:57:00.040]   It's not something that everybody's going to have in here at Lee because, you know,
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.200]   we all are different beings, if you will.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:08.520]   But again, if you put someone in that same scenario with the same deck of cards dealt
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.760]   to them, you know, let them see how they feel.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.720]   This is my life.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:20.800]   I don't know if it's nature or nurture, but I've sometimes I've convinced it to convince
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.200]   that it's a curse, but I've always far too much.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.440]   And this is why liberal radio sucks.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:32.520]   I've always said, but on the other hand, consider what's going on with them.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:34.400]   It drives Lisa crazy.
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:40.600]   It's like, but on the other hand, they feel this way about this stuff.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:44.120]   And it isn't compelling.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:45.480]   It makes people work.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:49.320]   You know, go ahead, Matthew.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:53.080]   You should walk a mile in someone else's shoes because then you're a mile away and
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.160]   you have their shoes.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:04.080]   Big Jim or B's mic song.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.360]   You can hear him laughing all the way over here.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.520]   That's he's just laughing.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.360]   Let's see.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:15.400]   I was going to say if you can you teach empathy, I was going to use Canada as an example about
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.800]   how you can, but then Matthew said that.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.000]   So, yeah, Canada fains everything.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.320]   Now let's be honest.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.320]   Canadians.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.160]   Google had an interesting project.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.640]   I'm trying to remember the name of it now.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.960]   I think it still exists.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.320]   And that's effectively what they were trying to do.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:38.800]   They were taking, you know, like terrorists and gang mangers and stuff like that.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:44.040]   And they were trying to encourage them to consider the people that they were attacking.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:46.520]   It was actually called Google's empathy lab.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.520]   Empathy lab.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.520]   That's fascinating.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:51.520]   Did it.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:55.520]   What was the I remember when they when they did this, I wonder what the thing of course,
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.480]   I'm sure Ruth Porat came along and said, screw you with empathy.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.680]   Get the empathy out of here.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.600]   I wonder what the make a lot of money.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.600]   That's the problem.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.160]   I wonder what the upshot of that that was.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.640]   You also have an effort by.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.520]   It's right, Matthew.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:15.680]   Eli Parrzer, author of the filter bubble, which as I've said on the show is pretty much
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.560]   the bunk, but he lies a great guy.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:22.200]   And Talia Stroud, a researcher at the University of Texas, who's just brilliant.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:30.240]   They have a project called Civic Signals where they're trying to come up with measurements
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.320]   for basically good behavior.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:33.840]   I have this discussion.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.360]   I talked to my old friend, David Weinberger, co-author of the Clutrain Manifesto.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:38.360]   Love.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:39.360]   Really?
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.360]   Clutrain Manifesto.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.360]   Yeah, David's brilliant.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:43.360]   And I had a quick Matthew.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:46.280]   This is a discussion I want to have with you too.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.440]   Offline as we say.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:52.720]   So I redefined journalism every couple of years because I have tenure and I can do that.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.200]   And I had one.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.360]   So it is Tucker Carlson, by the way.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.280]   Oh, you can't wait to get in.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.080]   It's our job to convene communities into, I first said civil, informative, productive
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.080]   conversation.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.360]   I realized civil was bad because it's a top down view of those in power, like the word
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.360]   objective.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.360]   So that I did respectful.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:14.560]   But no, respectful is also not a good word because it's something that gets imposed upon
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.560]   people.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:27.680]   And I don't have a word that simply describes the desire for a equitable, decent, fair,
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.640]   human conversation.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:35.040]   Inform is easy to define and productive is easy to define.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:43.360]   But I don't know how to define that quality of being decent to each other.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.160]   And then there's Burger King UK.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.320]   And then there's Burger King UK.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.240]   On International Women's Day.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:58.000]   Oh, tweeted, such good marketing women belong in the kitchen.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.640]   The problem is this was the beginning of something better.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:12.280]   But nobody theoretically anyway, nobody saw it because so many people were so upset
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:16.560]   about that.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.280]   Someone said in a tweet in an alternate universe.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:27.080]   They tweeted Burger Queen and they got 2 million new followers.
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:32.160]   Brianna was responsible to a Burger King was go F yourself.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.160]   Simple.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.160]   Simple.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.040]   It's just something their Twitter account did, but they took out a newspaper at like a full
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.040]   page.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:45.800]   It was a poorly unframed marketing plan.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:51.000]   Stuff like that happens and you know that's a marketing department, which means it has
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.440]   to go through a couple levels of approval.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.120]   Where are those approval people at?
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.560]   Well, they weren't women probably and all like me.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.320]   They're not working there anymore.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.240]   A bunch of guys.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.160]   It's such a.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.880]   They were trying to promote Burger King.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.320]   Well, they were trying to anybody sit and say, guys, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.320]   well, wait a minute.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.320]   Let me explain what they were thinking.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.320]   Not that it justifies it.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:20.000]   Burger King was, they were, plan was to announce their, her scholarship, H.E.R. helping equalize
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.720]   restaurants for female Burger King employees who want to pursue culinary careers.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:31.160]   So what they were saying is women belong in the kitchen, but it didn't really.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.160]   Look here.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.280]   No, no, in no way does it work.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.760]   It was kind of like, and we have scholarships so that women can get better jobs than the
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.760]   kitchen.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.760]   I don't know.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:47.640]   I guarantee after this happened, some marketing guy was like, but we got a lot of engagement.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.640]   Yes.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.640]   I can't guess.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.640]   22,000 retweets.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.640]   It's fine for Tucker Carlson.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.640]   Sad.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:01.880]   And it's exactly right.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:05.560]   You just really want a recording of that zoom meeting.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.560]   It seems like there's a good idea.
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.560]   Some approval.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.560]   Do you get it?
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.560]   We're doing it.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.560]   We're flipping it on its head.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:16.640]   We're giving women opportunity, but we're going to tweet it like it's some kind of sexist
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.640]   thing, but it's not.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   You get it?
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   We're flipping it on its head.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.640]   Because we look at the people.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.640]   That's what we do.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.640]   I don't need a story.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.640]   Just give me the facts.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.640]   That's all I want.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.440]   If you don't want a story, I'm going to go look at our top.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.440]   Tell me about the burgers.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.440]   But see, Steakums said product.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.280]   Tell me that bar really high.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.280]   That's the problem.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.040]   Steakums wasn't at all about the product.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.040]   But anyway.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.760]   Let's get back to Google.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.960]   Google's flock is a terrible idea.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.960]   Right?
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960]   It's the EFF.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.840]   We're going to talk about it next Tuesday on security now.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.360]   This is what Google is replacing the third party cookie.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.720]   We talked about last week.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:58.960]   They made a big and big lots of hay about how starting next year they're going to,
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.560]   Chrome won't support the third party cookie.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.800]   And Google said, we're not going to invest in any tracking technology.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.880]   So, their new technology, which has the worst acronym ever, Federated Learning of Co-Hards.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.440]   Can you imagine speaking of marketing?
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.880]   So, some guy, you're replacing a term called the cookie.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.320]   Well, we already know Google doesn't have marketing.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.520]   You're replacing a thing called the cookie, which everybody understands.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.520]   The flock.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.520]   They know what cookies are.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.960]   Yeah, let's call it Federated Learning of Co-Hards.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.280]   That's a great one.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:35.800]   I just commend the EFF for not using the obvious headline, flock you, Google.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.360]   But anyway, so what they-
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.760]   They're better than you, Leon.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.600]   I know, they are.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.680]   They always have been.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:48.680]   So the idea is, and actually, this isn't, in theory, this is not a bad idea.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:52.080]   It's something Apple does as well.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:05:00.240]   The idea is instead of following you directly, it aggregates information about you and your
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.640]   cohort so that it's not individualized information.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.200]   It boils your browsing down locally into a behavioral label.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:15.480]   And then that is the behavioral label is what gets shared with other websites and advertisers.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.200]   Which is the kind of behavioral stuff that people had.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.080]   There are companies-
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.080]   By zip code.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.080]   This is a doors person.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.080]   By zip code.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.080]   Well, not just that, but also other behaviors.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:28.080]   This is an outdoors person.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:32.400]   So you end up in an anonymized description, useful to advertisers, but doesn't violate
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   your privacy.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.400]   One helps.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.000]   So EFF writes, "We stand at the fork in the road.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.520]   Behind us is the era of the third party."
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.520]   The flock in the road.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.080]   No, you stand the flock in the road.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.960]   "Behind us is the era of the third party cookie, perhaps the web's biggest mistake.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.800]   Ahead of us are two pop-up possible futures."
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.520]   And I actually thought this was good.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:56.400]   In one, users get to decide what information to share with each site they choose to interact
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.400]   with.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.600]   This is what Tim Berners-Lee is advocating.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.560]   No one needs to worry their past browsing will be held against them or leveraged to manipulate
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.520]   them when the next open a tab.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:11.720]   In the other, Google's proposal, each user's behavior follows them from site to site as
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:18.440]   a label, inscrutable at a glance, but rich with meaning to those in the know.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.120]   Their recent history distilled into a few bits is democratized.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:26.480]   They put that in scare quotes and shared with dozens of nameless actors that take part
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.920]   in the service of each web page.
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:33.160]   Users in effect begin every interaction with a confession.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.520]   Here's what I've been up to this week.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.480]   Please treat me accordingly.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.560]   Now I'm starting to think this is a very, very bad idea.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:44.120]   And that's essentially what the EFF says.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.920]   It's going to introduce new privacy risks.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.560]   And there's all sorts of issues with it.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.920]   I mean, you're just asking one thing for another, right?
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:07:00.080]   Or the data streamed out onto the internet and companies sucked it up.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.280]   Now Google's saying, "Oh, well, just stay on your phone, except Google controls your
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.720]   phone and all the things you do on your phone."
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.960]   Well, the issue too, I think, is this.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:18.000]   And this is what Facebook ran across multiple, multiple times, right?
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.240]   If you want to, I'm trying to think of something that would be useful here.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.200]   Adult diapers.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.200]   Okay.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.360]   I should not have said that.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.360]   I'm really sorry.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.360]   Fine.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.360]   Okay.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.360]   Fine.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.360]   Fine.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.360]   Fine.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:39.680]   But you could do the negative of an ad, right?
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:50.640]   So if you want to start a campaign on equity and work aimed at poor people, for the best
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.480]   of reasons, that's good.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:56.880]   But then an advertiser can come along and exclude the poor people and only go to the rich people.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.880]   Right.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.880]   Bad example.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.880]   But stuff like that.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:04.720]   So the question is, what are the categorizations and how could they be misused and will they stay
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.720]   ahead of that?
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.360]   Otherwise, you know what the story is going to come up.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:15.640]   I tried to buy an ad for people, white men who are over 65 with white hair on podcasts
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.640]   buying adult diapers.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:20.400]   And I could do it, you know, because Google let me, right?
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.880]   And so any system that can be game will be game and be messed up.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.560]   Google's smarter about this.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.760]   It's history than Facebook has been.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.760]   So maybe they'll do it.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:35.920]   We still have to think about the regular consumer out there that is not going to take
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.560]   the time to go through and select what they want to share.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:45.280]   We're talking about the same people that tap except on every single app they install
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.920]   on your phone without knowing that it's saying, hey, I'm going to be listening to your microphone
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.280]   and tracking your location all day long.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.960]   This is why I donate to EFF every month.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.720]   They say, make no mistake, if Google does follow through on its plan to implement flock
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:09.760]   and crumb, which by the way it did or has, it's rolled out as a test in Chrome 89.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.400]   So millions of people have flock on their browser right now.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.720]   The system will probably be opt in for advertisers.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.800]   It will benefit it from it opt out for users to stand to be hurt.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.360]   Google will surely tout this as a step forward for transparency and user control.
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:28.160]   Just exactly what you're saying and knowing full well, the vast majority of its users
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:32.440]   will not understand how flock works and the, you know, the tyranny of the default.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.000]   Very few will go out of their way to turn it off.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.560]   Google will pat itself on the back for ushering in a new private era of the web free of the
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:45.760]   evil third party cookie, the technology that Google helped extend well past its shelf life,
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.640]   making billions of dollars in the process.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.200]   This is the paragraph I like the best.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.240]   It doesn't have to be that way.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:56.200]   The most important parts of the privacy sandbox like dropping third party identifiers and
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:00.600]   fighting fingerprinting will genuinely change the web for the better.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:05.760]   Google can choose to dismantle the old scaffolding for surveillance without replacing it with
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.440]   something new and uniquely harmful.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.960]   Google needs to learn the correct lessons from the era of third party tracking and design
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.600]   its browser to work for users, not advertisers.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.960]   And if they don't, by the way, people will just stop using Chrome.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.400]   They'll start using Brave or Edge or something that's de-googled.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.720]   But it's not just Google, Leo.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.320]   It's every single publisher, every single person advertising out there.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.320]   We're dealing with it.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:34.200]   Every advertiser wants us to put tracking somehow magically into podcasting.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.200]   Yep.
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:42.240]   I mean, we talked about this last week, but Google has first party data.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.880]   They'll probably do it OK.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:47.200]   I actually don't think that what happens there will be bad.
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.840]   What happened is the publishers demonize the cookie and be careful what you're lobbying
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.840]   for.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.800]   Now they don't have first party data.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.800]   They never got past having a mass relationship.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.880]   They use programmatic advertising.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880]   They're F'd.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.880]   They have themselves.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880]   All right.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.760]   You know, there were two ridiculous pieces this week.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:11.080]   I tweeted this morning, trying to blame Google for what the publishers didn't do.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.080]   Right?
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.760]   And so now Google is blamed for everything going behind us as well, because advertising
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.440]   doesn't work on the publisher sites.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.920]   Well, OK, but they could have made it work.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.200]   They could have had first party data.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.840]   They could have built relationships.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.840]   They didn't.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.440]   They just put up tabula and outbrain and programmatic ads.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.440]   Right.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.560]   So they became addicted to the cookie that they demonized.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.800]   And now when it gets pulled off underneath them, they've got nowhere to go.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.440]   So God knows what happens then.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.760]   It's going to be interesting.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.760]   Yep.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:50.800]   Google has found a unique solution to the tech tax being lobbied in France since 2019 and
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.840]   starting in Spain this year.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:58.480]   The tax, which quote covers a part of the cost of conforming the laws concerning taxes on
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:05.040]   digital services in France and Spain, it's really, it's really a tax.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.200]   It's a tax on Google because they're big in tech.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:15.280]   And so in France, it's a 3% tax on Google's French operations in Spain.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.280]   It's also 3%.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:22.920]   When Google's done though, is add to their ad rates by 2%.
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:27.200]   So that tax that Google's paying, they're going to pay 1% of it.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.840]   But guess who gets to pay the other 2%?
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.840]   Advertisers.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.240]   And guess who advertisers are going to pass that cost on to.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.560]   So this is a problem with taxes.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.560]   Yep.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.200]   Yeah, you have to consider where it ends up.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.200]   Yep.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.680]   And then you also have to consider where the taxes go.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.360]   This is my work with Australia is fine.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.200]   Let's say you do tax the platform is more.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.680]   Should it go to hedge fund owners or newspapers or should it go to internet access or should
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.680]   it go to help?
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.680]   Should it go to Rupert Murdoch?
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:01.000]   Yeah, I mean, French tax brought in 400 million euros in 2019 just to their general fund,
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   I assume.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.200]   They don't say it's earmarked for anything in particular.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:10.000]   But I think it's more just a, hey, how can we get in some of this Google money, basically?
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.640]   It's a deep pocket theory.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.800]   If you have money, I figure out a way to get some of it.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:16.800]   Google just says, yeah, fine.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.800]   Okay, we'll just pass the savings on to you.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:24.720]   Well, there was a story we didn't talk about last week that says that I think it's new
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.160]   head of treasury is open to now some international treaties about this.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.160]   Oh, interesting.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.160]   Would be really important because now what happens is every country says, no, Ireland
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.680]   says, put your headquarters here.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.680]   We're nice people.
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.680]   We have nice accents.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.680]   We have good beer.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.880]   What's not to love?
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:42.880]   Right.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.920]   And countries compete with each other the way cities do in the United States and Canada
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.280]   for factories and stuff like that.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:57.400]   So if you had some kind of regime across the countries that would eliminate the loopholes
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:02.240]   that countries create against each other, then they're actually fair tax Trump tried to
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.480]   get France to stop.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.040]   But it ineffectively, I think you're right.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.040]   I think it has to be broad multinational.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.200]   Has to be a great man.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.440]   You can't just say, hey, France, don't do that to our company.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.240]   That's not going to work.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.240]   You mentioned Ireland.
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.240]   I have to read this.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.240]   Then we're going to take a break.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.000]   It wasn't the best.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   It was the best.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.720]   It has nothing to do with Google.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.560]   But I'm going to read it anyway.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.560]   How did you find it?
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.720]   Because I didn't put it on the rundown.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.720]   I read it.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.760]   It was wonderful.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:32.360]   You know, probably found it on Twit.Social, which is our Mastodon instance.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.480]   I've been getting a lot of great links there from people.
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.600]   This is from the Irish Times.
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.600]   Patrick Frane.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:42.080]   He's writing about the Oprah interview with Harry and Meghan.
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.920]   The headline, "Harry and Meghan, the union of two great houses, the Windsor's and the
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.440]   celebrities is complete."
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:54.800]   After Harry and Meghan, the monarchy looks archaic and racist.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.160]   Well, duh.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.160]   But it's the lead that I love so much.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:02.280]   Having a monarchy next door, I should do this in an Irish accent.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:06.880]   Having a monarchy next door is a little like having a neighbor who's really into clowns
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:12.360]   and is dobed to their house with clown murals, displays clown dolls in each window, and has
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:18.040]   an insatiable desire to hear about and discuss clown-related news stories.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.920]   More specifically for the Irish, it's like having a neighbor who's really into clowns
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:27.320]   and also your grandfather was murdered by a clown.
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:30.080]   Beyond this, he writes, "It's the stuff of children's stories.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:36.440]   Having a queen as head of state is like having a pirate or a mermaid or an e-walk as head
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.440]   of state."
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.280]   What's the logic?
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.680]   Bees have queens, but the queen belays all the eggs in the hive.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.840]   The queen of the Britons has laid just four British eggs, and one of those is the sweatless
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:51.280]   creep Prince Andrew, so it's hardly deserving of applause.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.280]   That's all.
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.280]   Keep going.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.280]   There's more.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.280]   Keep going.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.280]   More all just keep going.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.280]   It's just so wonderful.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:58.360]   The contemporary royals have no real power.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.600]   They serve entirely to enshrine classism in the British non-constitution.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.040]   They live in high luxury and low autonomy, cosplaying as their ancestors.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.040]   Isn't that great line?
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040]   I love that one.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040]   Cosplaying.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.040]   And that's strong.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.040]   Is that beautiful?
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.040]   And the subject of constant psychosocial projection from people mourning the loss of
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.040]   empire.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.840]   They're basically a rorschach test that the tabloids hold up in order to gauge what level
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:31.680]   of historic bad-free their readers are capable of at any moment in time.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:36.480]   The most recent inner 19 struggles between the royal family and the newly disentangled
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:39.600]   Prince Harry and his wife, the former actor Meghan Markle.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.600]   Traditionally, us peasants would be nervously picking aside and retrieving our pikes from
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:45.600]   the fetch.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.600]   That's right.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:47.600]   That's beautiful.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.160]   And he does a callback later to the pikes.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:56.000]   Luckily, these days, the pitch battles happen in television interviews and he goes on.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.200]   We're regular rich folk Oprah, no different from you or Tom Hanks or Jeff Bezos.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.400]   The couple says.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.120]   We cut sporadically to the couple's own property where Oprah and the pair wander in
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:12.840]   hoodies, jeans, and anorax among rescue dogs and chickens, as if to say, we're just regular
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.640]   rich folk Oprah, no different from you or Tom Hanks or Jeff Bezos.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:23.000]   Arch Royalists will of course claim those dogs and chickens are crisis actors.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.400]   Oprah makes it clear from the start that the questions have not been vetted, although
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.480]   she reveals her cards when they start discussing the world wedding.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.920]   Oh, thanks for inviting me, by the way.
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.520]   Oprah describes their wedding as being akin to a fairy tale.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.360]   Meghan says it was an out of body experience.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:45.400]   And in fact, they had a small private ceremony a few days earlier.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.600]   I didn't know that.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:50.440]   Meghan admits she was a bit I didn't watch the interview.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:54.640]   I'm getting the best of it right now.
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.200]   Did you blindside the queen, as Oprah conjuring up an image of Harry sucker punching her with
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.680]   a karate chop?
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:05.280]   I picture the wily known engineering counter punching with the royal dagger between her
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.280]   teeth.
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.080]   Anyway, it goes on.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.320]   Did she bully staff?
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.480]   Well, no.
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:14.200]   Also isn't bullying staff part of what being a royal has traditionally been about?
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.640]   The Irish have no love for the royal family.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.800]   I take it and I don't blame them.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.800]   No, right.
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:20.800]   For good reason.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.440]   That was so funny.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.400]   The potential union of two great houses, the Windsor's and the Californian celebrity.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.800]   Do we mention the authors?
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:30.800]   We should.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.800]   Patrick frame.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.800]   I did say his name.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:33.800]   Okay, good.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:35.800]   Patrick.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:36.800]   He's really, really done.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.800]   R.E.Y.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.800]   And it is wonderful.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.800]   It is wonderful from the Irish times.
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.640]   And I apologize for my bad Irish accent, but I had to read it like that.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.640]   Let's take a break.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.640]   Come back.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.880]   More news, change log still to come.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:52.000]   Matthew Ingram joining us, filling in for Stacy who I don't know if she's really in the
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.520]   chat room or just somebody doing some Stacy cosplay, but Stacy.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.920]   Queen Stacy to you.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:18:59.920]   Queen's.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.240]   Queen Miss you, Stacy.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.120]   Come back soon.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.080]   But we're glad to have Matthew here from the Columbia Journalism Review.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.280]   And actually, it's a good time to have you.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:13.480]   Although your former colleague at Gigome, is that a Gigome t-shirt you're wearing?
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.480]   Sure.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.800]   I wonder if Stacy has a Gigome t-shirt.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.800]   That's nice.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:18.800]   Thank you.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:19.800]   You're a muted Matthew.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.800]   Look at that.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.120]   I'm running shirt that we got.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.120]   Oh, nice.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.320]   I'm pretty good, but I'm no Stacy.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.880]   Well, you're both two of my faves.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.200]   I miss Gigome and I miss Ohm for that matter too.
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.200]   Should we have--
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.440]   Oh, I feel like we should have been great.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.440]   We'll get Ohm.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.240]   I had a piece on the rundown last week.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.240]   His blog is great.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.040]   His blog was "Contemplating Reality."
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:50.360]   His blog is a really nice combination of articles about technology and deep philosophical
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.800]   thinking and watches in photography.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.880]   He's really good.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.160]   I miss Ohm.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.720]   So we'll have one soon.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.440]   The Yoda of Tech.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.520]   We except he doesn't talk backwards.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:11.920]   We also have Jeff Jarvis here from the famous Craig Newmark, etc.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:12.920]   Graduate of Germs.
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:13.920]   Graduate of Germs.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.920]   Graduate of Germs.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:19.480]   And of course from hands on photography and Pruitt.
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.480]   The anti-antipruit.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.440]   It's fun to have Trey on.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.760]   Wasn't that talk about a little bit about photography?
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:25.760]   I love that guy.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.760]   So cool.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.200]   And so just Zen.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.200]   He's very Zen.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.800]   He's very Zen.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.360]   He is Zenner than Zen.
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:44.760]   Our show today brought to you by the folks at ITPro, TV Old Friends, who do an amazing
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.760]   job.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.240]   If you're looking to get into IT.
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:49.240]   And you won't.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.800]   You know this, and you worked in IT.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:55.480]   If you don't have any experience in IT, it's hard to talk your way into an IT job.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.680]   The easiest way to get that first job is with the certifications.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.200]   That's why the cert system exists.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:06.200]   Certifications like CompTIA's A+ cert or Network+ cert or Security+ cert.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:09.360]   Those show you have the baseline of knowledge that gets you in the door.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:13.440]   And then once you're in an IT, and we have so many people I know who watch the show or
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:18.080]   participate in the show, who are IT professionals, you know it's part of the thing that makes
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.280]   the job great is that it's constantly changing.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.560]   There's always new stuff, new versions of the programs, new things to learn.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:30.080]   ITPro TV is for both people who want to get into IT, but people also who want to brush
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.400]   up on their IT skills.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:38.080]   And they have amazing trainers.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:42.720]   Even a seasoned IT professional can respect because they are people working in the field.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.320]   They're not hired for their good looks.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.040]   Although they're good looking, they're not hired for their fun entertaining, demeanious
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.480]   demeanor, although they're fun and entertaining.
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.560]   They're hired because of their knowledge.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:55.280]   But combine the three and you've got the best online IT training platform.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.720]   They do it kind of like we do.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.320]   They've seven studios in their Gainesville facility.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.880]   They're open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:05.880]   Cranking out content.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.280]   The reason they do that is because everything's always changing.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.420]   So their content has always kept fresh.
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:16.480]   But there's always at least 5,800 hours of fresh engaging video training online on demand
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.480]   for you.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.200]   You can watch on demand.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:23.680]   IT Pro TV works on your laptop, on your Android or iOS device.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.880]   They've got a Fire TV, a Roku, an Apple TV app.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.720]   So you can watch it or listen to it wherever you are.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.880]   IT Pro's business platform is awesome.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:38.880]   For anybody like us who want to support online IT training for their IT leaders and employees.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:43.520]   It's part of the ACI learning portfolio of audit, cyber and IT learning solutions for
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:46.360]   consumers and enterprises.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:49.200]   You get courses on every topic, malware detection.
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.960]   You kind of stay up on that, right?
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:55.040]   Cryptography, pen testing, and user security awareness.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.880]   How do you train your users not to get you in trouble?
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.320]   IT Pro TV is the only official video training partner for CompTIA.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.080]   You know you're in the right place for getting the right certs.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.200]   This month, Cisco month at IT Pro TV.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:14.520]   12 Cisco courses, CCNA, CCN, PCCT, Encore, Sled and RC.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:15.760]   I mean, they got them all.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:21.000]   They're also hosting a live webinar tomorrow with Cisco award winner David Bomball.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.280]   It's called Get Hands On with Cisco.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.320]   You can watch that March 11th.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:29.680]   But even if you're not around for the live event, you can watch on demand thereafter
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.640]   at IT Pro.tv/webinars.
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.600]   You'll see a lot of great webinars there.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.920]   And don't forget Don Pazette's.
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:39.640]   He's one of the founder's great podcast, Technado, featuring industry guests, IT News
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   Recaps.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.640]   That's free.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.600]   Everybody can listen to get a deep dive into the IT realm.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:49.920]   So IT Pro, I like to put this in because these guys are doing not only a great job for their
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.760]   customers, but for their community.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:59.480]   Last year they served 30 plus COVID impacted educational institutions with free training.
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.520]   So you know, that's one of the things they can do.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.520]   Isn't that great?
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.040]   That's one of the things they know how to do and they helped them out.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.160]   There's 225,000 members now at IT Pro TV.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:10.080]   And I think we could take a little bit of credit for that.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:13.560]   We've been sending people there since they started it in 2013.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:16.800]   IT Pro TV, here's how we're going to get you involved.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.800]   You've been thinking about it.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.800]   I know you have.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.920]   All you have to do is go to IT Pro.tv/twit.

[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.920]   I don't know if we're going to get to all of them.
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:04.600]   Google has announced the cloud next conference will be coming up in October.
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.560]   In real life or digital?
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.040]   They haven't decided.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.440]   They don't know yet.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.800]   It's interesting if you're talking about this earlier today, with Paul and Mary John on
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:15.920]   Windows Weekly.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.080]   Microsoft isn't as it was leaked.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:23.360]   Maybe it's not official, but leaked a slate of all our events.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:27.840]   They're going to continue to be virtual at least through March of next year.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.840]   And why not?
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.840]   Why not?
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.320]   Meanwhile, Mobile World Congress says they're going to be in person.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.320]   They did that last year.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.320]   Do you remember that?
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.040]   They did the same thing last year.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:40.560]   And then at the last minute, they said, yeah, no.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.760]   Everybody bailed too.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.280]   Yeah, and I'm just going to go to Barcelona right now.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.280]   No.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.280]   Maybe--
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.280]   Barcelona was what anybody right now?
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.280]   I want Barcelona.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:49.280]   I miss Barcelona, but--
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.280]   Yeah, I know.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.280]   Me too.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:55.480]   That's-- I think I have the reason people went to Mobile World Congress is how many
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.480]   bad it go.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.560]   For Matthew and me, it's perusion we can't--
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.560]   I know.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:01.960]   Are you going to get to do perusion this year?
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:02.960]   Not this year.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.960]   No, not this year.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.960]   Well, this year, no.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:05.960]   They've canceled.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.280]   It's going to be about now.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:13.200]   It's a big journalism conference in one of the most beautiful medieval towns of Italy.
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:14.200]   On Annabelle.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.680]   What's the dish there that I love and I learned to love there?
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:17.680]   Kat Choi, baby.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:18.680]   Oh, baby.
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:19.680]   No.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:22.080]   By the way, ever since you started talking about that, I had never heard of it to you
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.080]   mention it.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.080]   Now I see recipes for--
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.080]   Everywhere.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.080]   Everywhere.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.080]   Everywhere.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.080]   It's suddenly like the thing.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:30.080]   It's the first time we went.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.080]   It's wonderful.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.320]   The first time we went, I read and watched a bunch of Anthony Bournein.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.960]   And the first thing he said was to go out and find a tiny little tragedy somewhere in
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:44.600]   the neighborhood far away from everywhere and have some catchy paper.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.600]   Anthony Bournein.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.600]   So we did that.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:47.600]   So smart, such a big guy.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:50.480]   By the way, another guy, Trey Radcliffe, knew well.
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.480]   What?
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:52.480]   Yes.
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:53.480]   That damage.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:54.480]   I know.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:27:01.680]   Speaking of the wonderful, talented, brilliant, perspicacious, ubiquitous journalist, capital
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:08.360]   J journalist Taylor Lawrence, today in the New York Times article about a new app which
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:12.160]   I immediately downloaded called NuNu.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:22.040]   In the app, you as a contributor to a digital creator get to tell them what to do.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:25.200]   You get to the creator--
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.680]   It's not sex, right?
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:29.280]   Well, I'm not sure.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.280]   Well, yeah.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:34.040]   It describes his product as creating a human stock market.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:37.400]   I don't know if that's stock as inequities or stock as in cows.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:43.720]   On the app, fans pay to vote in polls to control some of a creator's day-to-day decisions.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:44.720]   A creator can use--
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.720]   It's so dystopian.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.400]   This is like Black Mirror.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.400]   It's like--
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.400]   It's the logical conclusion.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.040]   A lot of TikTok stars are on it.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.120]   It's just like a circus.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.400]   It's just like going on the--
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.960]   It's worse.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:56.960]   It's worse.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.840]   A creator can use NuNu to post a poll asking which sweater they should wear today or who
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:04.120]   they should hang out with, where they should go.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:10.120]   Fans purchase voting power on NuNu's platform to participate in the polls with enough voting
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:11.120]   power.
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.480]   You spend enough money.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:16.800]   You get to watch their favorite influencer live, live out their wishes.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.760]   It's a real life, choose your own adventure.
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.960]   So I opened NuNu.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.240]   Don't zoom in too close on this.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.160]   What could I always get?
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:33.200]   I started-- NuNu is very much like TikTok, right?
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.040]   So you swipe up.
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.040]   Let me see.
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:37.040]   This is trending.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:43.360]   And when I realized that a lot of what NuNu is, is people shaking their tuckuses for money.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.600]   It's pretty much what TikTok has turned into.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.080]   Oh, under age too much.
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.520]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.000]   No, no, no, no.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.560]   I don't understand it.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.880]   Maybe Cameron was.
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.360]   Not voting power to unlock.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.520]   See what Cameron's going to do.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.320]   See, I haven't gotten any voting power, so I can't unlock what live Cameron's going to
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.320]   do next.
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.320]   You do that with money, right?
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.560]   Yeah, real money.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:06.560]   Not even Bitcoin.
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.560]   Is it Bitcoin?
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.360]   No, actual money.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.360]   Don't do it.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.360]   I always try to get you to buy it.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:13.360]   No, I'm not going to do it.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.360]   Don't buy it.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.360]   Don't buy it now.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:19.800]   I just assume, I assume somewhere there's an app that's like that, but it's just for
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:23.560]   paying to watch people eat or something weird like that.
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.560]   It was called Justin.tv.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.560]   It's not Twitch.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:33.640]   I think really honestly, do you tell me, when you do a Twitch channel, I know Chad Johnson,
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:39.120]   OMG Chad told me this, as you're doing stuff, people in your channel can contribute and
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.360]   give you money.
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:43.560]   And for a lot of Twitch creators, it could be a lot of money.
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.560]   Right.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.040]   I do it on YouTube live.
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.360]   They have what they call super chats.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:52.760]   And basically, if they donate, their chat comment pushes up to the time.
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:55.440]   It gives me a little notification so I could see it right there.
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.880]   So it's not so different.
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:59.640]   Has anybody asked for anything weird?
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:04.800]   Yeah, one of the weirdest things for me is this Wacom tablet.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.720]   It's one of those, you know, touch things you can draw with.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.000]   People like this right here.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000]   Really?
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000]   ASMR.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   Oh, the ASMR.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000]   It's...
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.720]   They like that because I use that while I'm doing my post-processing on servers.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:24.720]   Just do it ASMR.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:27.720]   Just do it for us.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720]   Just do it.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720]   That's amazing.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:30.720]   Just do it.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.720]   That's amazing.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.720]   That's amazing.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.720]   That's amazing.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:34.720]   That's amazing.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.720]   That's amazing.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:36.720]   Does nothing for me.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.720]   Yes, listen.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:38.720]   Get it.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.720]   Out here, damn thing.
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.720]   Get it closer.
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:41.720]   Get it above the mic.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.720]   Out here.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.720]   No.
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:44.720]   No.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:46.720]   It's making me hot.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:50.720]   I'm going to stop now.
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:51.720]   Thank you.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.720]   Thank you.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.720]   Anyway, new new.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:57.720]   Taylor Rower.
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.720]   See, this is why they mock her because she writes about these trends.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.720]   But you know what?
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.720]   That's because they're old, stupid, old, young.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:05.720]   She didn't make it.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:06.720]   She's just saying it's going on.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:07.720]   And it is going on.
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:08.720]   And it's a big...
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:12.720]   And it's part of this changing world, but the youngs understand that.
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:13.720]   Right.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.720]   Taylor also got...
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.720]   Go ahead, Matthew.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:21.320]   I was just going to say, everything new that I've ever found out about has been from a Taylor
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:22.320]   Lawrence story.
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.320]   Oh, I agree.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.320]   They call the hype houses and all of that stuff.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:26.320]   That's all her life.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:27.320]   Yeah, she's brilliant.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.120]   Yeah, she covers that stuff like nobody.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:34.720]   She also suffered from male abuse on clubhouse.
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:36.720]   And after God inside.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:38.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:41.720]   Well, and a lot of that was pushed by some pretty prominent people.
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:47.720]   Because she created a burner account to get into rooms that work in recent block journalism.
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.720]   She was doing journalism.
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:50.720]   Right?
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.720]   That's called doing journalism.
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.720]   I mean, is there an ethical consideration there?
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.720]   Pretend it's a bit of one.
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:31:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.720]   If you're going to cover something, you should always go in as a...
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:03.720]   You should go in as a journal.
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.720]   With a fedora, with a cis press in it.
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:06.720]   Yeah, right.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:15.320]   People do do undercover journalism, but you have to be justified by what you are reporting
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.320]   on it.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:19.320]   So if it's child trafficking, then most people will say, "Okay, sure.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.320]   Go undercover."
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:28.000]   And proving that there was a great case where the struggle sometimes bought a bar just so
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.240]   that they could get hit up for bribery by the police and the city.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.240]   Right?
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.240]   Wow.
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.400]   So they didn't have a sign outside saying, "Sometimes bar.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:37.400]   I'd be here."
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:41.400]   You know, because otherwise they couldn't have gotten the story and it was a great story.
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.400]   More of the classics.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.480]   Another bit from this Taylor Lawrence piece.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:48.200]   It's in the style section, so okay.
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:53.440]   There's a potential to huge... earn a huge amount of money, said Joshua Wanders, 30, a
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.560]   YouTube creator with more than 8.7 million subscribers.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:01.000]   He said, "It's pretty much 100% profit driven by mania.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.160]   This week, Mr. Wanders.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.720]   I love how the Times gives you the...
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.200]   Mr. The Honorary.
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:08.200]   Mr. Wanders...
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.200]   Mr. Lo.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:14.560]   Mr. Wanders and four other creators will release photos of their feet as NFTs.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.560]   Go right.
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:20.240]   And so is it anything that you wrote about there any dumber than NFTs?
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.240]   Oh.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.240]   No.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.240]   No.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.080]   The creators will upload their feet photos onto an auction site and livestream the bidding.
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:27.800]   The livestream will also be monetized.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:30.320]   You have to pay to get in.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:33.440]   The Internet of Feet is a very powerful phenomenon.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.440]   Don't...
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.440]   I don't want to know about it.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.440]   Don't look into it.
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:40.320]   You then explain a lot because I constantly see TikToks.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.320]   I'm not going to...
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.000]   I'm going to stop using TikTok because it's been taken over now by young women who want
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000]   to show their assets.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]   But there's constant TikToks.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000]   Show us your toes.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000]   Show us your toes.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000]   Is that why?
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   So, yeah.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:00.120]   And in fact, many women who just post normal photos on Instagram and other people, things
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.120]   like that.
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:05.400]   If there are feet in it, you will get bombarded with messages from them.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:10.320]   I've heard of foot fetishism, but it must be...
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:11.320]   It's widespread or...
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:13.080]   I think maybe they're just more vocal.
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.080]   I don't know.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.080]   They just attack.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.720]   Something about TikTok.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:22.120]   Well, it's the great Clay Shurkey story about the beginnings of Meetup.
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:25.960]   After they kind of opened it up to any Meetup, the trendy Meetup was witches.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:27.960]   Because they had nowhere else to meet.
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.960]   So, where are you going to go to a place to meet?
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:31.960]   Right.
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:32.960]   Right.
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:33.960]   So...
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:36.160]   Stacey's putting articles in here.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:38.080]   Man, Stacey's in the chatroom.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.080]   She's putting articles in.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:40.080]   She can't keep away.
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:41.080]   She's just kids.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.360]   Or maybe just John didn't give her the Zoom.
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.360]   Is that what it was, John?
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.360]   No, no, no.
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.360]   She's calm and sick.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.360]   That's a joke because I couldn't get it in the Zoom.
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:50.360]   Fuck, that's what it was.
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:51.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.360]   By the way, it's working.
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.360]   You look great.
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:54.360]   It was working.
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:55.360]   Yeah, you do.
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.920]   I think I tried to tell you to do a Zoom a year ago.
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.240]   Oh, I'm sure you did.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.360]   I'm sure it was completely wrong.
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.560]   I think we're now looking at getting...
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:07.360]   Because of Alex Lindsey on MacPrick Weekly yesterday saying, "There's no better solution
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:08.360]   than Zoom."
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.360]   And he does this like you.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.560]   But he does it for a living.
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.560]   Well, I do too.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:12.560]   Well, I do too.
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.960]   Is the audio better?
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:17.760]   Yeah, they've actually improved their audio.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.760]   They've added new features.
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:21.480]   I'm very worried that Skype is drifting off.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:23.680]   Microsoft's already said we're going to merge it into Teams.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.440]   The last thing I want to do is use Teams.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.440]   Oh, no.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.440]   No.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:31.120]   OBS Ninja, which we had high hopes for because it's open source web RTC seems to have trouble
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.480]   with our network configuration.
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:37.360]   I'm going to talk to our network guy about that Russell.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:41.040]   But Zoom's doing all the things right and everything.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:44.640]   Maybe everything's optimized for Zoom.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.320]   What's the other...
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:49.000]   There was a story in here where I saw the origin story.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000]   Blue jeans.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.280]   Well, blue jeans, Facebook used to use it because they weren't allowed to use anything
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.280]   that was Google.
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:57.280]   Yeah, it's funny.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:58.280]   I remember blue jeans.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:35:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:00.280]   Blue jeans was really good.
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:02.280]   You know, there were sort of open source.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.280]   Hop in.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.920]   I can't remember the name of it.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:07.200]   So hop in just got around.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:11.000]   And I forget what makes hop in different.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.800]   Because you can hop into it.
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:16.920]   The founders said that he was diagnosed with a serious health condition, prevented him
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.680]   from venturing outside my home.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.160]   I was unable to meet people at 10 events and conferences while in the question.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.560]   You're like, sound familiar?
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:26.720]   So he made hop in.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.720]   So he's...
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.240]   Stacey, why don't let's have close.
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:31.840]   Did you remember clout?
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.280]   Oh, clout was terrible.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:40.320]   With a K, clout with a K that was to somehow raise your social network.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.880]   Yeah, measuring your value on Twitter.
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:44.960]   I met the guy who started it.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:47.400]   And he started it because he...
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.520]   I think had jaw surgery or something.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.320]   So his jaw was wired shut.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.880]   And so he basically had to stay home and couldn't think of anything to do.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:56.880]   So he created clout.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:57.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:58.880]   Let me drive people crazy.
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:36:59.880]   I'll make fun.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:04.400]   So Stacey, here's the note.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.040]   Stacey isn't going to be here but wanted us to talk about this because...
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:09.040]   Yes.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.000]   ...once y'all to talk about this.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000]   Yes.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000]   Because it's terrible.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000]   Amazon.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000]   Right.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.080]   So there's a great tradition in this country going back to Ben freaking Franklin.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.080]   Ben Franklin.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.080]   Ben Franklin.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:24.080]   That...
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.080]   The Public Library.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:30.640]   It's a great institution where when a book is published, the library buys some copy so
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:33.880]   they can lend them out to customers.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:38.800]   Used to be there was a library in every town.
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.680]   But of course, as we enter the digital world, times have changed.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.160]   Libraries want to lend e-books.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.200]   And there are ways to do that.
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:47.200]   There are platforms to do that.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.880]   The limit, the number of people who can borrow it at any one time, you still have to check
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:50.880]   it out.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:53.200]   You get it for a limited amount of time.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:56.560]   Just like borrowing a regular book, two weeks or whatever and there's only a certain number
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.240]   of copies.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.000]   The publishers seem okay with that but guess who's not?
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.440]   They weren't crazy about it but they came to pieces.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:05.440]   Publishers hate it.
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:06.440]   Yeah, they hate it.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.440]   That's a better way to play it.
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:11.640]   There's no way libraries would be created now if you tried to create the library system
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:12.640]   now.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:15.240]   Which is too bad because it's a great public benefit, isn't it?
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:16.240]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:22.320]   So as part of the culture to decide what those are, those are the libraries.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:28.180]   So thousands of public libraries offer e-books and audiobooks free just like they would
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:30.040]   regular books.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:31.560]   There are various platforms.
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:32.960]   One of the biggest is Libby.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:36.360]   Libby app.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:40.400]   And with the Libby app, the first thing it says is do you have a library card and it then
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:44.640]   says here's your closest library.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:45.960]   Use my location Libby.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.320]   Allow location access.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.920]   Here Libby's found my library.
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:51.400]   Okay, good.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.400]   Here's my library.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.280]   Snoma County Petaluma Library.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:58.800]   Yes, this is my library.
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:03.640]   And then I can use my library card to borrow books.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.120]   Except digital books.
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.840]   Except if it's from Amazon.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:09.840]   Because it turns out--
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:10.840]   The Amazon is the publisher.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:11.840]   If Amazon is the publisher.
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.760]   Yeah, because in most cases it's random houses or Simon and Schuster or somebody else.
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:16.760]   But Amazon does publish--
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:21.000]   Well that's one company now, but yes.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.760]   It's all pretty much Random House now.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:23.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:26.440]   Who publishes Dr. Seuss?
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.440]   Random House?
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:28.440]   I think it's--
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:29.440]   No, that's--
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:30.440]   Okay, question.
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:31.440]   Oh well, we'll talk about that.
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.920]   That's how it says estate.
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:33.920]   Oh, maybe.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:34.920]   Well they own the rights.
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.760]   But I don't know if that's the publisher.
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:39.120]   Yeah, anyway, Amazon has decided--
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.680]   Penguin Random House, yes, same one.
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:41.680]   It's Random House.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:42.680]   Same place.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:43.680]   Yeah, it's random house.
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.680]   Which should be--
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:46.520]   Because they have these imprints, Penguin-- you think Penguin's Penguin books?
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:47.520]   Can I remember it when I first went--
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:48.520]   It was a time in Schuster.
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:52.320]   As a kid I went to Europe and oh, we're in England, we can get Penguin books.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.800]   They were the best paperbacks.
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.800]   Remember Penguin paperbacks?
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:40:00.560]   The name of the company should be Random Penguin House, would you not agree?
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.560]   Yes.
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.880]   They're missing a good bet.
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:06.880]   Wanna borrow that e-book from the library?
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:10.600]   This is in the Washington Post, Jeffrey Fowler.
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:14.440]   Sorry, Amazon won't let you.
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.280]   He starts by talking about Mindy Kaling's book.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:19.400]   It's gone missing from the library.
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:24.840]   Her new story collection, Nothing Like I Imagine, isn't in there because she switched
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.960]   to Amazon as her publisher.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:28.520]   Probably gets a bigger cut, right?
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.680]   Because she's going with Amazon.
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:36.160]   And it says it's not going to sell downloadable versions of its more than 10,000 e-books or
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.120]   tens of thousands of audio books.
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:42.440]   I wonder if this includes Audible, which yet it does, because Audible's a publisher of
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.640]   audio books as well.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.960]   The libraries.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.960]   They don't believe in libraries.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:51.080]   Apparently they've been talking about it.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:55.880]   Because people can also use the library to decide if they want to purchase a book.
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:56.880]   Yes.
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:57.880]   Not just to borrow it.
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:03.360]   Yeah, but the main reason you use the library is so you don't have to buy it, right?
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:08.000]   Well, the main reason you use the library is so you don't have to buy it because you probably
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000]   can't afford it.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000]   But that's right.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000]   Right.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.920]   But then there's some people that they love to read, but they've been burned a few times
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:22.920]   by buying a book that's stunk out loud and, you know, they get the bar and read a couple
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:25.400]   chapters and say, "Huh, maybe I should affect this."
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:30.480]   The often the case that I'll buy an audio book from Audible or a Kindle book from Amazon
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:33.000]   and then end up buying a hardcover.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000]   But I can afford that.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.640]   And so the whole point of a public library is to bring education to everybody regardless
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:41.640]   of whether they can afford it.
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:42.640]   Right.
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.640]   Prepare the Amazon policy.
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.640]   What's Audible's policy?
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:46.640]   Return a book.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.280]   I get a chapter in the book and say, "I just hate this and return it."
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:54.400]   But you won't find Audible in the library because I just found out, reading Jeffrey's
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.440]   article, that it is also not going to the library.
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:02.480]   Amazon publishes audiobooks and audiobooks under its own brands, including, I didn't
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:04.480]   know this, Lake Union.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.360]   Amazon loves doing this.
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:09.520]   Making up these fake brands and have some snooty names.
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:11.520]   And it's like Walmart, those.
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.160]   Like Thomas and Mercer.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:15.560]   That sounds like a nice English company, right?
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:16.560]   Some guy.
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:18.400]   In business in 1746, I think.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:19.400]   Yes.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:20.400]   Tweed suit.
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.280]   Mr. Mercer has passed, but I still run the company.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.280]   No, no.
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.280]   Jeff Bezos.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.080]   He costs play.
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:28.480]   Audible.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.760]   So those aren't going to go in there either.
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:33.720]   So can I give you a contrast to this?
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:34.720]   Yes.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:38.240]   So I talked to David Weinberg today, just because we hadn't talked too long.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:39.240]   And I didn't know this.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:43.880]   He edits a series at MIT called Strong Ideas.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.720]   And here's the fascinating, and I was trying to think about whether to try to do something
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.000]   like this with my book.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.640]   They sell print editions of the books in the bookstores, but they also are digital open
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:57.720]   access available on the Pub/Pub platform.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:58.720]   So you could print it.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:06.400]   I just, this is, this is to your point, Ant, and Leo.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:07.400]   It's a sales pitch.
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:10.920]   There's a new book out called How Humans Judge Machines.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.840]   So I thought, I said, wow, it's open access.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:14.920]   I could download the entire PDF.
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:15.920]   I did.
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:18.560]   I read a few pages and I said, man, I got to mark this up.
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:19.560]   I bought the 30 bucks.
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.560]   I bought the hardcover.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:24.880]   Well, same thing with speaking of Jochi Benkler.
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.120]   He did the same thing with MIT and his Wealth of Networks.
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.160]   And I did download it and I did buy it.
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.160]   So that's your point.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.880]   And he did it with Network Propaganda too.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:35.880]   Did he?
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:38.120]   Yeah, I think this is his moment.
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:45.240]   People like Corey Doctorow, Benkler are deep believers in this idea of open access.
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:48.160]   And Corey has always said, Corey publishes everything for free digitally.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.360]   He's always said, I do just fine.
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:51.360]   Thank you.
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:53.520]   People will buy my books.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.680]   And if I offer them for free, people will buy them.
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.880]   I talked to the publisher, Benkler.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:04.640]   And Corey does drive them nuts because he wants to be Corey Way.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.680]   But he's so popular and so good.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:07.680]   He can do it.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:09.920]   Yeah, he can do it.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:12.680]   And thank goodness there are authors, because there's a lot of authors who don't have that
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.840]   clout, who just have to go along.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:18.160]   Thank goodness authors like Corey, who have the clout and all the incentive in the world
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.920]   to not make it freely available, still do.
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:28.200]   So I would love to do a, I might try to do it if they'll take it.
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.600]   But that, because an author wants two things, right?
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:36.360]   An author wants some money, but an author also wants to get ideas out there.
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.360]   Why do I blog?
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:43.400]   Some would argue the brain will be the second book as well.
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.440]   That second book, second book deal.
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.720]   There's a certain amount of faith.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:50.120]   It wasn't Apollo Coelho who published The Alchemist.
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:55.840]   He may have been the first to really embrace this a long time ago.
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:57.840]   I interviewed him about this.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:58.840]   He was my book.
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:44:59.840]   Oh.
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.880]   And, and, and he got caught by his publisher.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:05.480]   He pirated his own books.
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:10.120]   He uploaded the book to Japan in some languages.
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:12.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.120]   But it worked.
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:14.120]   In Germany.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.200]   He did it in Germany in particular.
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.920]   And he said that he, it was someone said, but people will steal your books.
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:22.960]   And he said, most of those people weren't going to buy my books anyway.
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:24.320]   Good point.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.520]   That's always the point I've made about game piracy is those aren't people going to buy
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.160]   the game.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:37.400]   So the Alchemist, you know, initial print run was 900 copies through a small Brazilian
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:40.680]   publisher and they decided, yeah, that's, they didn't reprint it.
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:43.120]   That was it.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:47.320]   So he had another book which did well.
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:53.920]   The Alchemist took off, but a lot of it because he, he gave it away and he's a believer in
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:54.920]   that.
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:59.280]   And it really has made him a star, a celebrity, a novel.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.280]   He is sold.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:01.800]   Do you want to guess how many books he has sold?
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:03.800]   How many copies he's sold?
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.520]   Three hundred fifty million.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:07.520]   Wow.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:10.680]   Paul knows how what he's doing.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.240]   However, so I saw him that part of me for this is I don't do it anymore, but you can
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:15.240]   be fun of me still.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:16.440]   What Davos.
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:24.520]   So Paolo and I were at the same dinner with Sergei, Bryn, and my publisher had sent over
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:26.720]   a box of what would Google do.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:30.440]   So I was giving them away and and Paolo said, don't give him away.
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.040]   Suddenly people were rich.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:36.960]   No, he got mad at me for that.
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:39.240]   The guy who's given his own book away.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.240]   Exactly.
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:42.600]   He said, no, no, no, you know, you're doing for about the reasons I do it.
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:45.120]   But when it comes to selling the hardcover books, you sell them.
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:47.200]   Take the rich, take the rich.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:49.200]   Yeah.
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:50.200]   So what's going on at Twitter?
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:55.480]   It really feels like Twitter is kind of reinventing itself.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:00.080]   They've talked about super follows as a way to build revenue.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:06.080]   Apparently they're working on a big overhaul of TweetDeck and considering making it a
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.440]   paid service.
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:12.600]   That would, you know, I have mixed feelings about that because I love Tweet.
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:17.200]   It's the only way I use Twitter's TweetDeck.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:19.920]   But TweetDeck hasn't really been kept up to date for a long time.
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:24.040]   In fact, this is all stuff they should have done five years ago.
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.040]   Well, they build gross.
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.680]   I don't know if this is known or not.
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:29.080]   I don't think you'd be objecting me saying this.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.680]   Bill Gross was an inch away from buying TweetDeck.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:32.680]   Bill of ideal.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:34.680]   Oh, no, this is well, though.
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:38.480]   I loved Twitter, absolutely loved Twitter and saw the potential and wanted to do things
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.560]   around it.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:43.840]   And so he was inch away from buying TweetDeck and then Twitter came in and scooped in underneath
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:44.840]   them.
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:45.840]   Yep.
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:50.520]   Basically, the threat was no API for you.
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:52.200]   And so we lost it.
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:55.320]   And then Twitter just sat on it and didn't do anything with it.
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.080]   Eli Patel had a big article yesterday.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:58.920]   He was going to start an ad network.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.920]   Yeah.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:00.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:02.080]   Twitter didn't want him to do that.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:04.400]   But they didn't want any of the third party clients to succeed.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:07.800]   They really wanted it all to be first party.
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:13.880]   Big interview with KVON BAKEPOR, who is Twitter's head of consumer product.
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:17.320]   Eli Patel yesterday on the Verge.
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:20.120]   Lots of information about what Twitter's planning.
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:23.160]   There's Twitter Spaces, which is basically their clubhouse.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.200]   Fleets we know about.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:25.840]   We've talked about that.
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.320]   They bought review recently.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:31.960]   We talked about that too, which is a substack style newsletter publisher.
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:36.760]   Super follows, which will let people pay creators on Twitter for special content.
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:38.760]   I should try it with pictures of my feet.
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:40.760]   Dude, please, no.
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:41.760]   Please, no.
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.760]   Can I pay you?
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:44.760]   What if they pay not to do that?
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:45.760]   I'll pay you no.
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.760]   That's a great idea.
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:48.840]   So do that.
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:53.760]   I start tweeting pictures of my feet and say, if you don't want to see pictures of my feet,
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:54.760]   pay me.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:55.760]   Subscribe here.
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.760]   That's eight.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:57.760]   That's eight.
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:58.760]   Brilliant.
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:00.160]   Pay me not to say moral panic.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.160]   Oh, okay.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:02.680]   I'd pay you not to say moral panic.
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:05.640]   I really want to stay so you pay more.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:11.640]   I think a lot of these things that Twitter is trying started with what's the name?
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.640]   Elliot management, the hedge fund.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:17.720]   I think they're really put a fear into Jack.
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:21.280]   Because they're one of those activist investors who pressures.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:24.880]   They got into product ideas or just know you need to innovate.
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:28.280]   No, I think they basically said you need to make some cash.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:30.880]   Oh, you need to do some stuff.
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:32.280]   We need you to do some stuff.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:34.280]   Make some money.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.680]   You need to get those daily active users.
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:36.840]   We don't care what it is.
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:37.840]   We don't care how.
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:38.840]   Just do.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:40.840]   You need some revenue.
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.520]   Put that undo option in there.
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:43.520]   I saw their finally.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:44.520]   Pay for that.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:45.520]   Starting to test that out.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:46.520]   You get it?
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:47.520]   Do you have it?
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:48.520]   I don't have it yet.
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.520]   I just saw that.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.080]   They never let me use any of those things.
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:56.960]   I did get pulled into spaces.
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:57.960]   Is that what it's called?
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:49:59.960]   They're audio.
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:00.960]   Yeah, they don't have them.
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.200]   No, I got pulled into someone else's because I didn't really request it.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:06.040]   I didn't care to.
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:11.360]   But it was pretty neat to hop in and just chat and share information with other folks
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:15.680]   and see other people popping in and joining and leaving feedback.
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:17.040]   It was pretty neat.
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:21.600]   But at the same time, I'm thinking about clubhouse and all of the benefits there, but
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.960]   it's still, it's just closed off.
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:26.440]   If you don't have an iPhone, you're out of luck.
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.440]   I don't like that idea.
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:30.440]   Me neither.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:33.280]   Anyway, we're reading the interview.
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:35.720]   It's long.
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:39.120]   If there were anything like, "Oh, they're about to do this," I would say it, but it's
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:42.040]   not immediately clear what they're...
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:44.280]   They can create spaces.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:46.520]   They can create a new email newsletter.
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:47.600]   They can go to the moon.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:50.880]   They can go to the Mars, but they can't give us an edit button.
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:51.880]   Right.
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:52.880]   Undo edit something.
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:59.400]   I believe all the way to get your tweet back is if you curse in it or something, right?
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:01.880]   If you put a next tweet in your tweet...
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:05.080]   Well, hell, then I can get rid of all mine.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:08.640]   I believe we tried it out on Twig.
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:11.360]   Not too long ago, Mr. LaPorte said something pretty...
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.640]   He said it something bad to me, didn't he?
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:14.880]   Pretty kind to you.
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:17.080]   I'll just say that.
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.960]   I couldn't take it back.
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.880]   Wait, I missed it.
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:26.200]   So, Twitter is testing an undo option after sending tweets.
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:27.200]   You can kill it.
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:31.120]   The way it works is with the progress bar and I suspect that what they're really doing
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:34.080]   is not sending the tweet for a period of time.
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:35.440]   It's almost same as Gmail.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:36.440]   Same as Gmail.
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:37.440]   Just like Gmail.
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:38.440]   Like Gmail does.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:42.240]   Because the same problem, Twitter has the same problem, is that as soon as it's published,
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:44.560]   that tweet goes out into a lot of different places.
[01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:45.560]   You can't take it back.
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:46.560]   Right.
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:47.560]   You can't take it back.
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.560]   And just why the edit is a problem because it's RSS basically.
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:50.560]   Yes, it's difficult.
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:54.000]   Or do you can settle down your Twitter by living in Russia?
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:57.080]   They don't like what people are saying on Twitter.
[01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:02.760]   So they've slowed it down with the threat of closing it down.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:05.920]   I think is this about the Navalny protests?
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:10.800]   Well, yeah, Rod Twitter didn't take down protest content.
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:11.800]   So they're slowing it down.
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:16.000]   Then they tried to slow down a bunch of other services I saw on, you know, I was using Google
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.800]   Translate on Twitter.
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:22.560]   And evidently the government, I think, accidentally kind of slowed down their own sites.
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:23.560]   So it didn't work so well.
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:24.640]   Well, and we've mentioned.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:30.080]   I think we mentioned, maybe not, mentioned on Sunday that India is threatening to arrest
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:37.680]   executives of Twitter and Facebook for allowing posts about the farm protests.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:42.760]   India had required that these companies have in-country executives they could talk to if
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:45.400]   there were issues with the content.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:47.360]   And that's how they're going to talk to them.
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:52.560]   Well, India's new regulation says that they're going to, all the platform is going to have
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:57.840]   to take down things that are false or that threaten government unity.
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:01.280]   Align 116 pages four and five.
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:05.920]   You'll see a long list of things that they're going to require.
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:09.120]   And what do you do with the platform?
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:17.040]   According to Andre Soldotov, Russia's slowing down of Twitter caused the outage of some
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:18.680]   government websites.
[01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:24.640]   It was meant to be a nationwide test of the sovereign runette infrastructure, partly
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:30.240]   a warning to global platforms and partly a soothing message to Putin getting emotional
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:32.520]   and it failed on all fronts.
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:39.200]   So I guess when you build a great firewall, sometimes it has consequences beyond the people
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:40.200]   you're targeting.
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:41.760]   It's like a Death Star.
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:43.600]   You know, when you kill a planet, it all goes.
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:46.600]   There's nothing much you could do.
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:53.040]   Twitter is suing Texas according to Fox Business.
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:58.280]   They allege that the Texas Attorney General is seeking to punish Twitter for taking Trump's
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:06.840]   account offline, Paxton, Ken Paxton, the beloved Attorney General of Texas, announced
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:10.360]   that he's being investigated himself for bribery, announced an investor.
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:11.640]   Is it bribery or corruption?
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:12.640]   I can never.
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.560]   I can never keep a story.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:18.520]   And now it's an investigation at Twitter and further major technology companies for what
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.040]   he called the quote, seemingly coordinated de-platforming of the president.
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.600]   Yeah, it's coordinated.
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:27.600]   Oh, Lord.
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:28.600]   Be well.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:35.440]   Well, line 122 similar story that governor is trying to get on the act now.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:38.760]   So people forget about the fact that they couldn't drink any water.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:45.480]   He wants to ban social media, wants to ban Facebook and Twitter from banning where they're
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:51.480]   banned from banning big tech efforts to censor conservative viewpoints is un-American and
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:53.680]   we're not going to allow it in the Lone Star state.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:57.680]   Y'all says Greg Abbott.
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:06.040]   You know, it's not as bad as Modi's India, but it's a slippery slope.
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:11.560]   At least we have a First Amendment that we can go to court on and say, no, no, you can't
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:12.560]   do that.
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:13.560]   No.
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:17.640]   Sorry, Matthew.
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:21.320]   If you thought maybe the Biden administration would take it easy on big tech, we mentioned
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:28.200]   Tim Wu is going to the National Economic Council, but there is another appointment.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.200]   This doesn't mention it.
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:31.000]   I should find that story.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.920]   Tim Wu who wrote a journal article some years ago asking whether the First Amendment is
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:35.920]   obsolete.
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:36.920]   I just want to add that.
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:37.920]   You just want to throw that in.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:38.920]   You know that.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:39.920]   What?
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:40.920]   Yeah.
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:41.920]   Maybe he was just talking.
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:42.920]   He was just talking.
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:44.200]   Well, I think Wu says some good things.
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:48.880]   I like the kill switch and some attention merchants, but in fact, I think we interviewed
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.840]   him for triangulation as I remember on the attention merchants, but he also is widely
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:57.920]   quoted for wanting to break up Facebook.
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:59.360]   More panic.
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:01.360]   I didn't say that.
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:09.680]   And now Lena Kahn, who's another Columbia University scholar, is nominated to the Federal
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:12.280]   Trade Commission.
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:20.200]   She is also kind of known for her anti-big tech stance.
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:25.360]   You know, Wu was in the Obama administration and says he regrets allowing the Facebook
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:31.200]   mergers, all the big tech mergers that the Obama antitrust, you know, the FTC and so forth.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.200]   Michael was up to him.
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:34.760]   Well, he was an advisor.
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.440]   He was an advisor at the time.
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:37.440]   He said, "I regret it.
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:40.480]   I think we should have been harder on that."
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:47.480]   So it's going to be interesting to see if this is a...
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:50.360]   He's a pretty thoughtful guy.
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:56.560]   But at the same time, you know, I mean, I think more and more people in the Biden administration
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:04.800]   who are, you know, on record as being kind of, you know, let's break up big tech.
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:06.960]   They're too powerful.
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:07.960]   This is a...
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:08.960]   Is it I think a signal?
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:09.960]   Well, there's a hearing.
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:14.400]   I just sent to a representative a statement for...
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:21.160]   I got called for a hearing this Friday from Judiciary's Antitrust Subcommittee to see whether
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:24.760]   I would be a likely witness than I told him what I thought.
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:26.760]   And they said, "No."
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:27.760]   I think not.
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:30.640]   I mean, there were Republicans who'll get you in there.
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:34.000]   Well, no, I mean, no, I don't agree with them either.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.080]   But I wrote a statement.
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:38.120]   I'll put it up online probably Friday when the hearing knows.
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:41.200]   So they actually said, "Well, what are your feelings I'm breaking up big tech?"
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:44.800]   And when you told them, they said, "Oh, we're not going to have you."
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:48.000]   Well, no, it was a very nice, nice, wonderful...
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.320]   But they don't want somebody who's defending big tech up on this.
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:55.880]   Well, not to defending big tech, I'm ridiculing stupid regulation.
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:56.880]   Oh, okay.
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:57.880]   That's worse.
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:58.880]   Yeah.
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:57:59.880]   Yeah, because that's kind of that homin.
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:00.880]   Because they want to...
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:01.880]   You know, Australia, that sounds interesting.
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:02.880]   No.
[01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:05.640]   I mean, try your way of stocks.
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:06.640]   No.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:07.640]   No.
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:11.560]   Let us play the drums, bang the gong.
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.160]   It's time for the Google change.
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:14.160]   Jason added some.
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:16.320]   Last time I looked, it was three things here.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:18.440]   Oh, Jason worked hard.
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:19.440]   Jason's working.
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:20.440]   Oh, it's...
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:22.440]   Keyboard statement.
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:24.000]   Yes.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.600]   [laughter]
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:30.700]   New things coming your way from the big goog.
[01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:35.720]   Camera-based Google Fit, heart and respiratory rate tracking, which we've talked about before,
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:42.680]   was announced last month, is now rolling out with version 2.51.19 of Google Fit.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:46.280]   There'll be a new check your heart rate and track your respiratory rate.
[01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:48.040]   If you have a pixel, I do somewhere.
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:54.080]   I shall have to check and see if my Google Fit is updated.
[01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:55.640]   I'm checking my version now.
[01:58:55.640 --> 01:58:57.680]   I should see because I'm not on 2.51.
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:58:58.680]   I'm still on 2.50.
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:03.080]   That'd be kind of cool if I could demo it.
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:06.520]   I'll turn it on and we'll see if we can get it working here.
[01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:10.160]   Google Voice is going to stop forwarding text.
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:13.800]   This is really a problem for me.
[01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:16.800]   Using Google Voice must be torture because it's just bit by bit.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:22.280]   They take off one finger this week and then they take off the one-toe next week.
[01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:26.440]   So I'm not sure if this is going to affect me or not.
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:36.480]   This is a feature I used all the time, which would forward text messages to my linked numbers.
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:40.880]   This is the notice that you'll get on that setting in your Google Voice.
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:44.800]   Important message forwarding to linked numbers will stop soon because mobile carriers have
[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:47.360]   started to block these messages.
[01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:50.120]   That's always been the problem with Google Voice is that that phone number has never
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:52.160]   been treated like a real phone number.
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:53.160]   All right.
[01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:54.760]   It's all looked like spammy.
[01:59:54.760 --> 02:00:01.320]   Well, or just like you try to use that Google Voice number as a for text updates and stuff
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:03.520]   and people say, "I can't use that."
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:06.240]   So carriers, I don't think like that.
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:08.040]   They don't like the gateway or whatever.
[02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:11.200]   So SMS forwarding about to go away.
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:14.640]   Just a word of warning.
[02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:18.920]   Happy birthday, by the way, to Chromebooks, 10 years old.
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:19.920]   Yay!
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:21.920]   Happy birthday to us.
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:28.960]   Happy birthday to the best inexpensive, wonderful laptop you can have without any problems.
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:29.960]   Happy birthday to us.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:32.440]   Is it a party if only one person goes in?
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:33.440]   Yeah.
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:34.440]   Yay.
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:35.440]   No.
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:37.440]   I like Chromebooks.
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:40.600]   Google is linking Android phones to Chromebooks with a new phone up feature.
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:45.880]   There's a feature that Microsoft touted the your phone feature on Windows.
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:51.800]   You'd think there'd be better integration between your Chrome OS and your--
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:53.480]   That require a Microsoft phone?
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:54.480]   No.
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:55.480]   No, isn't that funny?
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:56.480]   An Android phone.
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:01.600]   No, actually, your phone works really nice on Windows with, say, a Samsung.
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:05.120]   Chrome OS is getting a bunch of features to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:08.880]   The biggest edition, according to the Verge, a new phone hub feature that connects an Android
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:15.080]   phone to a Chromebook, allows Chrome OS users to respond to texts, check a phone's battery
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:18.960]   life, enable its Wi-Fi hotspot, and locate a device easily.
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:19.960]   This is not-- I don't know.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:21.720]   Do you use your Pixel to log into your Chromebook?
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:23.200]   That's a nice feature.
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.840]   I use that.
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:29.120]   But this will go a step farther, which is kind of cool.
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:31.760]   My Pixel isn't logged in all the time.
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:36.800]   I've complained about this on the show because Google Maps doesn't know this spot on Earth.
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:37.800]   Oh.
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:38.800]   Oh, really?
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:42.800]   I have to-- every single time I use my phone in my own home, I have to--
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:44.240]   You don't exist here.
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:49.080]   Well, stop living in a bunker.
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:51.840]   If you were me too, man, you might have to.
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:56.640]   It's enlightened self-interest, man.
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:59.360]   Let me just see if I have an update for my Google Fit.
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:01.400]   I have a lot of updates.
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:03.320]   There's so many updates.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:05.600]   I haven't updated in a while, obviously.
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:07.080]   Aren't they supposed to happen automatically?
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:11.120]   Seems like sometimes I'll go in there and there's 50 updates.
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:12.080]   Well, I'll let those--
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:14.040]   I'll let those turn that off.
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:15.440]   Yeah, it's probably something you did.
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:17.040]   Yeah, probably.
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:18.480]   Oh, Google, update me.
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:19.000]   Uh-oh.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:26.080]   You'll find the phone hub in a taskbar widget that expands to show you recent Chrome
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:27.600]   tabs you've been browsing on your phone.
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:28.920]   That's nice.
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:31.600]   So some real nice-- this is good.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:33.720]   This is the kind of thing Apple does with the iPhone.
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:37.400]   Microsoft even does with Android phones now, it's on Chrome OS.
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:40.840]   Chrome OS is also going to add nearby share between Chromebooks
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:46.080]   and other Android and Chrome OS devices, kind of like AirDrop for Chrome OS.
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:49.440]   It'll let people send and receive files between devices.
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:53.080]   This is going to arrive in the coming months.
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:57.080]   New screen capture tool will be in the Quick Settings menu on Chrome OS.
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:01.120]   It'll let you record your screen as well as take screenshots.
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:08.960]   And you can access them quickly in a space that is called tote.
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:11.480]   Like everybody knows what a tote is.
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:13.760]   Tote your flocks.
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:16.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:17.080]   Tote.
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:19.880]   They couldn't call it something like, you know, I don't know, screenshots.
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:21.920]   They call it tote.
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:23.000]   OK.
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.840]   I hear that word, and I can hear my grandmother asking me to to tote the groceries.
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:31.080]   Tote the groceries, and the clipboard is also being improved in Chrome OS.
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:34.960]   You can save five recent items to paste elsewhere without switching windows.
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:38.880]   The launcher key will provide access to this updated clipboard experience.
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:40.160]   Quick answers.
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:45.280]   Let's you right click a word in Chrome OS to get a definition, translation, or unit conversion.
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:49.400]   Again, the feature Mac OS has had for years.
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:04:01.480]   The virtual desktop, do you ever use your Chrome OS virtual desktops?
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:02.480]   I think that's a nice feature.
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:03.480]   It's called desks.
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:08.480]   When you reboot a Chromebook, it will now restore all windows to their correct virtual
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:09.480]   desktops.
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:12.960]   So you can get it all set up, get it all looking good, and it'll remember it.
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:13.960]   That's cool.
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:14.880]   You can even right click on the on the title bar and send a window to another work space.
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.520]   So that's cool.
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:17.600]   I have to play with that.
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:23.040]   Because I live on workspaces, both in Linux and on Macintosh.
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:25.560]   Like, well, here I could show you.
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:27.080]   I've got this is the article.
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:28.320]   This is the chat room.
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:29.320]   This is our ad.
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:32.320]   I've got multiple workspaces set up.
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:35.920]   Because I like to go full screen, so it makes it very easy.
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:38.520]   This is Linux, but Mac has something very similar.
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:40.920]   Windows does to it.
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:44.800]   I really like to work that way because maybe the iPad's influenced me.
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:45.800]   I like full screen.
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:48.360]   I like to do that, but I don't do it as much now.
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:54.000]   But it was nice to be able to separate projects on a different environment.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:58.160]   And it really nice if it remembers that between boots, right?
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:04:59.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:00.440]   Really nice.
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:04.440]   So that's going to be a good selling point for Chrome OS.
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:07.240]   Happy birthday.
[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:10.520]   Chrome OS, 10 years old.
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:13.240]   I guess it was about 10 years ago.
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:15.360]   Jeff, we got our little black CR 40.
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:17.600]   You got your CR 48 side wasn't there that year.
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:18.600]   Oh, you weren't.
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:19.600]   I was jealous.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:22.280]   Yeah, Google I/O they handed them out.
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:27.000]   Google Chrome is moving to a four week update cycle.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.880]   They were on a, I think, a six week update cycle.
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:34.640]   So major versions now are released every six weeks with smaller security updates every
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:36.200]   other week.
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:42.960]   This year, Google is going to move to a four week rotation.
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:44.920]   So I think that's probably a good idea.
[02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:45.920]   They say as we've improved.
[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:46.920]   We've improved 30.
[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:47.920]   Yeah, probably.
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:51.920]   As we've improved our testing and release processes for Chrome and deployed bi-weekly
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:56.680]   security updates to improve our patch gap, it became clear we could shorten our release
[02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:59.800]   cycle and deliver new features more quickly.
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:03.120]   So it isn't for security because you're getting those security updates bi-weekly.
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:06.600]   It's for feature updates.
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:09.520]   There is, they've fixed the patch gap.
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:12.360]   That's the good news.
[02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:14.840]   Whatever you've heard, there is no patch gap.
[02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:20.800]   You might be interested in this, and according to XDA developers, Google Photos is starting
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:23.280]   to roll out the advanced video editor.
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.280]   I don't know.
[02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:25.280]   I'm waiting.
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:28.200]   I keep checking for the update and I still haven't gotten it.
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:31.840]   It's in the March feature drop.
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:33.840]   I don't know if you have to be a Google One customer.
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:36.840]   You know that some of the features of Photos, you have to be a Google One customer.
[02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:37.840]   Right.
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:38.840]   I am.
[02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:42.120]   Yeah, I am too.
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:48.560]   I know exactly because it's a staggered rollout, but you're expected to go wide this month.
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:50.800]   It's just like waiting for your COVID shot.
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:51.800]   Yeah.
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:53.000]   You have both of them now, Jeff?
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000]   Yeah.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.000]   Yeah.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.000]   Yeah.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000]   He's good to go.
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000]   Good.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000]   I got one.
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000]   You got one?
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.000]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000]   All right.
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000]   And you have an appointment for the other one?
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000]   No, we're like good ones.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000]   You got one of the good ones?
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000]   They're all good.
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.400]   You know, as far as I'm concerned, if you avoid death, that's good.
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:09.400]   Yeah.
[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:10.400]   No, I'm.
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:13.120]   I got that'll keep me from getting seriously ill or dying.
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:14.120]   That's good.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:16.120]   That's a good start.
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:21.680]   Google Meet breakout rooms can now be set up before the call using your Google calendar.
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:24.280]   That's all I have to say about that stuff.
[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:25.280]   Yeah.
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:31.080]   Google TV Kids Profiles arriving on the Chromecast this month with parental controls and time
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:32.560]   limits.
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:33.560]   So that's nice.
[02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:38.200]   If you have that new Chromecast with Google TV, a couple of nice features for parents.
[02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:44.280]   And finally, Android Auto, and I have it, although I can't use it because my Ford has
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:49.080]   a some sort of incompatibility with Android Auto and causes a boot loop.
[02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:50.080]   Yeah.
[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:51.720]   Every time I go boy, really?
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:52.720]   Come on.
[02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:53.720]   It says it's fixing it.
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:55.440]   There's going to be an update coming out soon.
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.600]   So I just use my iPhone.
[02:07:56.600 --> 02:07:58.520]   But must be frustrated.
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:00.480]   People were Android, you know, only boy.
[02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:01.480]   Yeah.
[02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:02.480]   Yeah.
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:06.000]   It's wireless car play, which is awesome.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:12.120]   You're just getting the car and all of a sudden the big screen is car play and I can't wait.
[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:14.920]   Android Auto, I think in some ways is better than car play.
[02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:19.640]   And now they're going to add split screen support for wide screen displays.
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:20.640]   You don't have wide screen.
[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:21.640]   You have tall screen, right?
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:22.640]   I have wide and tall.
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:23.640]   I'm big and tall.
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:24.640]   Okay.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:27.640]   I don't know about the tall part.
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:29.680]   Not compared.
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:32.400]   I'm not in either big nor tall compared to Mr. Pruitt.
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:34.280]   But I'm sorry.
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:35.280]   Do it.
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:38.000]   Should I call you Mr. Ant?
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.160]   You can just call me Ant.
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:45.920]   So I love it that everybody you talk about, you say, Miss Lisa, Mr. Jeff.
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:48.600]   That's a that's a southern thing, isn't it?
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:51.800]   No, it's probably more like a mother Pruitt thing.
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:53.880]   It was beaten to you as a yes.
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:55.440]   That's right.
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:56.440]   You're very polite.
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:57.440]   I love that.
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:58.440]   It's wonderful.
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.040]   So I'll call you Mr. Ant.
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:01.040]   Okay, Mr.
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:06.560]   Ant. Brand new split screen options starting to become available for Android auto users
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:13.040]   out there, limited to those with large or wide in car head units or dashboards.
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:18.280]   But if you've got the split screen, whatever your primary app is, we'll take up a bigger
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:19.480]   left portion.
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:22.040]   Here's an example of the Android out of display.
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:23.040]   So there's your music.
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:28.520]   And then I don't know how your place is, but here's the little inset with the map in
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:32.680]   it, the smaller right hand section will play us to your secondary application.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:35.400]   So music and maps would be a good.
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:37.600]   And I would presume there's some way to swap those.
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:38.600]   Swap it out.
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:39.600]   Right.
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:40.600]   Yeah.
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:41.600]   Yeah, that's pretty slick.
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:42.600]   It's kind of extreme.
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:49.440]   It's more like 70 30 60 40 might be better because it's a little tiny little wedge on
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:51.320]   the on the right.
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:54.360]   And it's also now it's now it's just a little bar on the bottom.
[02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:55.360]   Right.
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:03.080]   So it's 70 30 just because of the safety aspect of driving and also screens are a little more
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:04.080]   restate.
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:08.920]   Let's give you a little more real estate.
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:14.080]   Other users have received the update or suggesting that split screen mode is forced when enabled,
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:18.320]   meaning you can't switch between UIs or switch apps from one side to the other.
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:22.520]   Oh, no matter what Android Auto head unit you have.
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:27.200]   So once it's enabled, you know, you don't have to enable it.
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:31.760]   Once it's enabled, you don't really have a lot of control over how it how it does that.
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:38.920]   And that thank you, Jason for filling that up is the Google change log.
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:43.520]   Oh, here's the hop in.
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:46.360]   Here's the I found the hop in it was down under other.
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:47.360]   Yeah.
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:50.080]   Well, where else would I was I put it?
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:51.960]   I don't know.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:53.960]   I guess I'll hop in section.
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:11:06.640]   I'm going to let you guys pick from these because there's a whole bunch of these little
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:08.400]   stories.
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:12.920]   Apple podcast is going to it's both give it and take it away.
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:19.440]   It is for most podcasts, the number one tool people use for us.
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:22.960]   I think it's pocket cast, but it's but Apple podcast is right up there.
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:26.640]   And it's always bugged me that the button says subscribe because I think most people
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:31.040]   think subscribe means pay like subscribe magazine.
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:35.560]   And I don't know if you remember, but for years I said it's free, but press the subscribe
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:37.000]   button things like that.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.040]   I finally just gave up on that.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:42.400]   It turns out for medicine research, like you try not to use the word podcast.
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:44.640]   Yeah, you know, I fight these fights.
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:46.640]   There's a cast from people you love.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:48.840]   Man, we dropped that one too.
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:53.760]   According to all it wasn't wrong though, according to Edison research, 47% of new podcast listeners
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:56.440]   think that when they press the subscribe button, they're going to be charged.
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:11:58.600]   I never thought of that.
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:00.200]   Yeah.
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:03.600]   So good news.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:05.160]   Apple is going to start using the word.
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:06.640]   I don't know if I like this.
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:10.000]   Follow instead of subscribe.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.200]   It's a very social.
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:13.200]   Twitter word.
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:14.200]   Modern.
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:15.200]   Yeah.
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:19.240]   Moderns, except they're also changing the behavior when you follow a podcast.
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:22.720]   It isn't automatically downloaded anymore.
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:28.720]   Oh, because Apple has decided that most people are streaming, not downloading and listening
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:30.800]   later.
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:31.920]   So I can see that.
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:40.200]   There's some concern in the podcast world that could cause a drop in revenue maybe even
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:48.640]   because people may just stop listening or I don't know.
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:50.720]   So anyway, that's going to be a big change.
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:51.720]   We'll see if that affects us.
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:56.040]   I would suspect, you know, we always tell people to subscribe because then you've got
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:57.040]   it.
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:59.440]   Maybe you don't listen to it, at least you downloaded it.
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:03.360]   If you have to press a button and stream it, I think there may be that may impact listenership.
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:04.960]   We'll see.
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:08.760]   We shall see.
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:13.160]   I miss that you want to talk about.
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:16.000]   Do you know about Internet Archive Scholar Scholar?
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.680]   This is good for me.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:19.680]   Yeah.
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:21.440]   Google has a Google Scholar.
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:24.080]   This is now from the Internet Archive.
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:31.880]   The full text search index of over 25 million research articles and other scholarly documents
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:33.600]   in the Internet Archive.
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:34.800]   So they have to already be there.
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:40.680]   The collection spans digital digitized copies from 18th century journals, the latest open
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:45.240]   access conference proceedings and preprints that they crawl from the worldwide web.
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:48.520]   Before the show, I went in and searched, of course, for Gutenberg.
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:49.520]   Yeah.
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:52.360]   Did you find anything interesting that you didn't know?
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:53.360]   Yeah, I did.
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:55.040]   How about Gutenberg and Cicero?
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:56.280]   It's in German.
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:02.320]   Novell du Gutenberg from the Cayé Gutenberg in French.
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:08.920]   The Gutenberg variations, a rare journal of rare book manuscripts and cultural heritage.
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:16.040]   Roll over Gutenberg from Nature Magazine, 1999.
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:17.200]   And they're all here, which is nice.
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:23.480]   I mean, not only do you do the search, but you can actually read these, right?
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:24.480]   Yes.
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:25.920]   Farewell to Gutenberg.
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:28.840]   2000 sexually transmitted infections.
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:31.320]   There's another Gutenberg biological.
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:32.320]   Oh, OK.
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:35.560]   I was going to say that's a usage of Gutenberg.
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:38.960]   Here's Will Xerox kill Gutenberg in 1977.
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:42.440]   Look at that from G. Harden Science Magazine.
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:43.440]   Wow.
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:44.440]   Did it?
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:45.440]   Not really.
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:46.440]   No.
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:49.440]   McLuhan thought it would.
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:52.320]   McLuhan thought that this was the...
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:56.520]   Imagine what McLuhan would have thought when he heard about digital copies of...
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:57.520]   For NFTs.
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:14:58.520]   Or NFTs.
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:00.320]   He's the one person who would have understood NFTs.
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:02.320]   Oh, I guess...
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:03.320]   Oh, I guess...
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:05.720]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:06.960]   This was from the AAAS.
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:13.320]   This was all about students Xeroxing books instead of buying the books in school.
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:14.320]   Yeah.
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.320]   Yeah.
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:20.000]   We got a lot of our reading materials in college where Xeroxed even back then.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:21.920]   Back in the day...
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:25.240]   Ah, do do do do do do do do do...
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:31.240]   I think Mr. Jarvis put this in, that Stanford AI index on line 165.
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:33.240]   Does that sound like way to...
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:36.240]   I put it in there indeed, but I didn't read it.
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:43.880]   It was pretty fascinating because it's looking at the effects of COVID from 2020 and some
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:45.120]   of the developments around.
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:48.640]   And if you just look at those takeaways, it makes you...
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.120]   Just sort of makes you think.
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:58.000]   Well, for instance, the greatest amount of private AI investment in 2020, $13.8 billion,
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.360]   $4.5 times higher than 2019, went into what?
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:02.360]   What do you think?
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:04.360]   Drugs, cancer, molecular and drug discovery.
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:05.360]   Good.
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:07.840]   Actually, I think you can credit AI a little bit.
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:09.600]   Can't you with the mRNA vaccines?
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:10.600]   I think so.
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:11.600]   I agree.
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:12.600]   I think that...
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:13.600]   AI was...
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:14.600]   The weekend...
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:19.000]   Right, within a weekend they were able to gen... genomically sequence COVID-19 and come up
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.040]   with a potential vaccine, which as it turns out is the one you just got stuck into your
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:25.640]   arm, Matt.
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:34.440]   I think it's fascinating that the woman who proposed mRNA vaccines was ridiculed by her
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:35.440]   colleagues.
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:37.680]   That's academia for you in a nutshell.
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:39.320]   Yep.
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:41.640]   Something new, we all like it.
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:45.720]   You'll never make that work.
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:54.120]   I mean, all science, all science only makes headway because you fight against the prevailing
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:55.120]   notion, right?
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:56.120]   Right.
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:16:59.240]   All progress depends on the unreasonable man.
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:00.240]   And test the test.
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:02.560]   You just did seven words.
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:05.400]   Put what I tried to say in a paragraph.
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:07.200]   Perfect.
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:09.000]   The industry shift continues.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:12.640]   Again, the Stanford AI report.
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:21.040]   In 2019, 65% of graduating North American PhDs in AI went into industry up from 44%
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:23.360]   10 years earlier.
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:26.960]   Everybody's going into industry.
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:28.920]   This is something Stacey would love to talk about.
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:32.760]   She always talks about generative neural networks, right?
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:38.440]   AI systems can now compose text, audio and images to a sufficiently high standard that
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:41.640]   humans have a hard time telling the difference.
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:45.640]   AI has a diversity challenge.
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:46.640]   Mm hmm.
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:47.640]   Yeah.
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:49.640]   Especially Google.
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:56.560]   45% of new US resident AI PhD graduates are white.
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:01.880]   2.4% African American, 3.2% Hispanic.
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:03.360]   We got to fix that.
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:04.360]   Yep.
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:05.360]   Not just lip service.
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:09.320]   I was thinking the other day.
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:11.680]   Is artificial intelligence just a really bad name?
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:13.200]   Oh, it's a terrible name.
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:15.480]   What would you name it instead?
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:16.480]   Machine learning is better.
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:17.480]   Yeah.
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:20.360]   Machine learning is still not there.
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:21.360]   What is it?
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:24.760]   Machine learning is a little too rigid for the regular normal folks.
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:25.760]   Yes.
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:26.760]   Well, and it comes down to how you talk about computers.
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:31.440]   Yeah, what you define this as, see, because I am of the strong opinion that all people
[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:35.160]   often think, you know, AI is just a computer program.
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:37.960]   Computer programs, normal computer programs are deterministic.
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:41.000]   Some programmers said, if this happens to do that, if that happens to do that.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.000]   Yep.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.080]   And there's no, you know, you can't think outside those lines.
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:52.120]   The whole point of AI is thanks to machine learning, a computer can adapt itself by learning
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:53.400]   about the real world.
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:54.760]   No programmer writes it.
[02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:58.080]   In fact, often with AI, no programmer could read it.
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:03.720]   They have no idea how the computer decides this looks like cancer, this doesn't.
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:06.000]   That to me is true AI and it starts with machine learning.
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:10.400]   I mean, that's the, to me, that's what distinguishes it from just pure old programs.
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:11.400]   I don't know.
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:13.520]   We need a better, we need a better name.
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:14.520]   I agree with you.
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:16.800]   I don't know what it would be.
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:23.440]   The problem with AI, just like Tesla calling its adaptive cruise control autopilot is it
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:28.000]   implies a lot more capability than actually exists.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:33.120]   I mean, you know, there couldn't have been a more innocent name imagined than cookie.
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:34.120]   Yeah.
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:35.120]   And it became demonized.
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:36.120]   Well, it kind of doesn't matter.
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:41.100]   The real name for cookies and you'll see why they named it cookies is persistent client
[02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:48.040]   side state information, which PC SSI could have been Pixies, which I think would have
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:49.880]   been better than cookies.
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:50.880]   Might well have been.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:51.880]   Yeah.
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:53.680]   Those little Pixies are following me everywhere.
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:54.680]   Yeah.
[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:55.680]   Right?
[02:19:55.680 --> 02:19:56.680]   Isn't that better than cookies?
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:19:57.680]   Pixies.
[02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:01.040]   Anyway, again, like net guests.
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:07.000]   I'm just tilting against when Mills here.
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:11.120]   When I started at an interview weekly, I insisted to the staff they couldn't abbreviate it.
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:12.120]   They couldn't call it E.W.
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:13.120]   Oh, but they did.
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:14.120]   And it's great.
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:15.120]   They did.
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:16.120]   E.W.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:17.120]   I gave up.
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:18.120]   Yeah.
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:19.120]   E.W.
[02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:20.120]   So great.
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:21.120]   Finally, I'll wrap it up with this.
[02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:22.120]   Thanks to science.
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:23.680]   I think it's science.
[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:27.960]   Arby's has an answer to all that plant based meat.
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:32.360]   You see it other fast food chains, a meat based carrot.
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:33.360]   Yes.
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:36.960]   Arby says, we'll never have artificial meat.
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:38.680]   We only have meat meat.
[02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:44.040]   So they've unveiled a product a carrot made from turkey.
[02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:45.840]   Would you like to watch it being made?
[02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:47.320]   Oh, no, thank you.
[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:49.000]   They call it the merit.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.920]   I want to see how the sausage is made, Matthew.
[02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:52.920]   We can make veggies from meat.
[02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:55.400]   Come on, Matthew.
[02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:59.680]   Like the first ever meditable, the merit.
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:01.400]   Looks just like a carrot, doesn't it?
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.880]   Take some turkey breasts.
[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:05.040]   Arby's you have won me over.
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:06.440]   Salt and white pepper.
[02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:07.440]   This is a great tic-tac.
[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:09.760]   It's the opposite of the Burger King thing.
[02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:13.120]   Wrap it up in cheesecloth and plastic wrap.
[02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:14.280]   Tie it on.
[02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:15.840]   Then dip it in the deep fat fryer.
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:16.840]   Now notice they tied it.
[02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:18.840]   So I'm sorry, they're subeding it.
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:19.840]   Subeding it.
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:21.480]   They made it a carrot shape.
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:22.480]   So it's seweded.
[02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:24.560]   Now you're putting dried carrot cheese powder all over it.
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:25.560]   So it's authentic.
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:26.560]   It's pretty cheating, I think.
[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:27.560]   Let it rest.
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:29.600]   And then oven roasted for one hour.
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:31.160]   What do you think it tastes like?
[02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:32.160]   Turkey.
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:33.160]   Turkey.
[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:35.160]   Oh, that looks delicious.
[02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:36.160]   Oh, geez.
[02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:37.160]   That is bad.
[02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:38.160]   Oh, man.
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:39.160]   So it's turkey.
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:40.160]   It's a terrible type of arby.
[02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:42.240]   It tastes like chicken.
[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:43.440]   I don't know if...
[02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:44.440]   They're not so bad.
[02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:49.160]   No, arby's insists the merit is not a stunt.
[02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:54.320]   We're actively determining this is the problem, whether or not we can scale it.
[02:21:54.320 --> 02:21:57.840]   They say it's about 50/50 that they can...
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:21:58.840]   So this is a...
[02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:01.160]   They're testing it in the test kitchens.
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:03.600]   And they hope someday to be involved.
[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:07.960]   I would buy a merit when you go to Arby's just to get a merit.
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:09.480]   I'd go after the show.
[02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:12.200]   Yeah, right now.
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:13.440]   Chatteram's giving Arby's...
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:17.480]   I'm sorry, it's Burke giving Arby's B+ for effort.
[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:18.480]   Great.
[02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:22.160]   Great lukewarm grade.
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:27.240]   Very lukewarm grade.
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:31.960]   I like the idea of a meat-based plant.
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:38.000]   You know, okay, if you could work in one fast food test kitchen, which chain would you
[02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000]   want to work in?
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:41.720]   That's it.
[02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:42.720]   You go by.
[02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:43.720]   Yes.
[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:44.720]   Popeyes.
[02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:45.720]   No.
[02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:46.720]   Oh no.
[02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:47.720]   Taco Bell.
[02:22:47.720 --> 02:22:48.720]   Taco Bell.
[02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:50.800]   Yeah, I thought you'd give it up on Taco Bell.
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:51.800]   Taco Bell.
[02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:52.800]   I know, Matthew.
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:55.800]   I don't even want to go in there.
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:57.640]   No, I don't blame you.
[02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:00.880]   It would have to be Chipotle even though I don't eat there.
[02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:01.880]   Really?
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:04.560]   But it seems like they would have a better round of things.
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:08.840]   I think Jack in the box, because of all the fast food chains, they have the most menu
[02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:11.280]   items and the weirdest menu items.
[02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:12.280]   Right.
[02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:16.040]   They're always trying something bizarre and weird.
[02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:18.280]   I mean, they have a new product every month, it seems like.
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:19.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:20.840]   Maybe you have five guys, maybe.
[02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:23.240]   Five guys, but they don't see that it's always there's not.
[02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:24.240]   There's not.
[02:23:24.240 --> 02:23:25.240]   There's a fries.
[02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:26.240]   What are you going to test?
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:27.240]   Merits.
[02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:28.240]   But still, what do you mean?
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:29.240]   It's burgers and fries.
[02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:30.240]   What's wrong with that?
[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:32.240]   I didn't think you were on meat.
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:33.240]   Best.
[02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:40.200]   Best summer I ever spent in college was working in the Yale University test kitchen.
[02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:46.480]   They bring in a fancy chef, a French, he was a Frenchman, to create and test recipes
[02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:51.160]   for the dining halls for the upcoming school year.
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:53.640]   And I was the pot scrubber, but he was great.
[02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:57.480]   He was very fries at Leo.
[02:23:57.480 --> 02:23:58.960]   This was the only thing I remember.
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:00.360]   He gave me his wisdom.
[02:24:00.360 --> 02:24:03.720]   Leo, an onion is like a woman.
[02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:05.720]   Okay.
[02:24:05.720 --> 02:24:08.080]   You peel it from the bottom up.
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:09.080]   Oh boy.
[02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:10.080]   Okay.
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:14.760]   If Stacy were here right now, she'd be punching me.
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:16.960]   We're going to need a show.
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:17.960]   I didn't say it.
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:19.920]   This French guy picks up the chips.
[02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:22.280]   But it was fun because he would make all these things.
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:24.680]   First of all, there's more considerations in his flavor.
[02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:25.680]   It has to be makeable.
[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:29.480]   You don't have to create a recipe that can be made in mass for a bunch of people.
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:30.480]   Right.
[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:32.760]   By people who are not particularly brilliant chefs.
[02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:37.320]   So he and they would so it was so much fun because he would cook all morning and lay out
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:39.240]   20 dishes.
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:43.160]   And I'd be scrubbing the patsies he's cooking because you know he's cooking like up a storm.
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:48.080]   And then we'd all stop and we test, taste eat each of them.
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:50.040]   So I have worked in a test kitchen, I guess.
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:51.760]   It was it was my best summer ever.
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:52.760]   I loved it.
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:53.760]   Pretty cool.
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:56.680]   And I learned how to peel an onion.
[02:24:56.680 --> 02:25:01.280]   T-Mobile is stepping up ad targeting of cell phone customers.
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:04.000]   Of course, they completed their merger with Sprint.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.640]   So you'll all be affected by this.
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:09.560]   They are it's opt out.
[02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:11.600]   But of course, nobody will know to do that.
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:20.440]   They're going to share customers web and mobile app data with advertisers starting April 26th.
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:22.600]   So just a word of warning if you're a T-Mobile customer.
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:26.840]   This needs to be said a couple times quite, quite frankly.
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:29.840]   Because again, it's it's opt out and nobody's going to know.
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:34.720]   So hopefully this is going to be said a few times up until April.
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:36.160]   I get the word out.
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:41.560]   T-Mobile says, we've heard many of our customers say they prefer more relevant ads.
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:45.960]   So we're defaulting to this setting.
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:52.000]   T-Mobile because of their merger with Sprint has 60 million users under its main brand,
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.360]   20 million more under prepaid plans.
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:26:00.000]   The change will not apply to business accounts or children's lines.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:07.280]   But AT&T automatically enrolls wireless subscribers in a basic ad program that pulls them into
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:12.560]   groups based on inferred interests, kind of like flock.
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:16.560]   Verizon, of course Verizon remember had that super cookie for years.
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:18.360]   They're cooking, yeah.
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:22.920]   Likewise, pools subscriber data before sharing inferences about them with advertisers.
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:25.000]   So Verizon knows what you're doing.
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.320]   Although, but they don't share it with advertisers.
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:33.040]   But a more detailed sharing program called Verizon selects for users who enroll.
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:36.040]   It's a separate Verizon media.
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:40.560]   They also collect data from Yahoo and AOL, which they also own.
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:44.040]   T-Mobile says it will mask right into the prevented advertisers and other companies from
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:47.560]   knowing what websites they visit or apps they've installed.
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:52.480]   You get, this is very much like the Verizon super cookie, you get a special device ID just
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:56.400]   for you.
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:00.280]   Privacy groups, note those IDs can be linked back to people by comparing different data
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:02.840]   sets.
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:04.360]   So yeah, just be aware of this.
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:05.920]   This is big bucks.
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:07.680]   It's not really that new.
[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:11.920]   In the T-Mobile app, if you have a T-Mobile account, you can visit the T-Mobile app, visit
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:19.040]   the more tab advertising and analytics, turn the toggle off to stop using my data to make
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:20.960]   ads more relevant to me.
[02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:25.520]   I wonder what Apple's going to do on the iPhone with this.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:31.000]   But probably forced T-Mobile to disclose, I would think.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000]   Maybe.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.000]   Yeah.
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000]   Hope so.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000]   All right.
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:42.400]   I'm going to take one more break then, if you will, prepare your picks of the week.
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:45.840]   Jason, do we know if Stacy will be back next week?
[02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:47.040]   I hope so.
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:48.800]   Stacy, we miss you.
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:49.800]   I hope so.
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:51.800]   I hope so.
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:53.560]   Our show today brought to you by Linode.
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:54.560]   You know I'm a Linux guy.
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:56.200]   I'm using Linux right now.
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:01.800]   I'm an a Linode user for probably a decade, a long, long time.
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:06.400]   I first became aware of Linode because they were offering Linux servers running on SSDs
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:09.200]   back when that was pretty darn exotic.
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:10.360]   So cool.
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:12.160]   So fast.
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:16.520]   Linode believes in cloud computing for all.
[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:22.360]   Whether you're a big company or a little guy like me or a developer in between 800,000
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:24.560]   developers choose Linode.
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:25.560]   And there are a lot of reasons.
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:29.560]   By the way, my reason is best customer service in the world.
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:34.160]   These guys are geeks, guys and gals, are geeks.
[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:36.160]   When you talk to them, they will handle your problem.
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:37.160]   They don't tear you up.
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:39.000]   They don't say, oh, I'll get a supervisor.
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:39.960]   They don't hand you off.
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:43.300]   It doesn't matter if you're a little guy like me or a big enterprise.
[02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:47.880]   You're going to get great customer support from people who really know their stuff 24/7,
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:49.920]   365 days a year.
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:50.920]   Linode also is big.
[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:53.200]   In fact, bigger than they were when I first started using them.
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:57.040]   Now they have data centers all over the world and they don't charge you more depending
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:28:58.040]   on location.
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:01.960]   They have the same simple, consistent pricing at every data center.
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:02.960]   Choose the one nearest you.
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:04.800]   You're going to get the best price.
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:10.080]   They've got a great intuitive cloud manager, one of the best APIs I've ever seen.
[02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:11.520]   You can do anything with Linode.
[02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:12.720]   Host your website.
[02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:17.120]   I do it because I like to do web based coding.
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:23.800]   So it's a lot easier for me to spin up a server on Linode, try out, react or Node.js
[02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:24.800]   or whatever.
[02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:29.800]   I'm going to get it done when I'm done.
[02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:32.800]   It's cheap, it's easy, it's fast.
[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:36.800]   But you can also do it to store or backup media.
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:39.800]   You could, I mean, disguise the limit.
[02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:45.800]   Easily launch and enrich your developer applications, hosted services, websites, AI.
[02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:51.800]   They've got great machine learning hardware, gaming services, your CICD environments.
[02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:53.800]   You can build on Linode and those SSDs, yes, they are fast.
[02:29:53.800 --> 02:30:01.360]   You could choose shared instances for affordability or dedicated instances for speed and performance.
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:05.800]   You could get S3 compatible object storage, managed Kubernetes, whatever you want.
[02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:06.800]   Linode's great.
[02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:11.600]   And they have a fantastic YouTube channel where you can watch video, tutorial, security
[02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:12.600]   tips.
[02:30:12.600 --> 02:30:14.440]   It's absolutely free youtube.com/linode.
[02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:18.520]   I know a lot of people use those videos just to learn.
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:23.120]   Bryce Adams from Mediorek, one of their happy customers, says quote, "From the start, we
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:26.440]   were looking for a partner, not a provider.
[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:30.040]   Some of the large providers see us only as a transaction.
[02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:35.120]   Linode is the kind of partner that will be with us from the start today and beyond."
[02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:36.760]   Multiple Stevie Award wins.
[02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:41.120]   That's their sales and customer service awards.
[02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:42.360]   Linode's customer service.
[02:30:42.360 --> 02:30:43.360]   I'm not surprised.
[02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:46.520]   Awarded for excellence for three years in a row now.
[02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:47.520]   Thanks.
[02:30:47.520 --> 02:30:48.520]   Congratulations, Linode.
[02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:50.020]   That's awesome.
[02:30:50.020 --> 02:30:51.280]   Simplify your infrastructure.
[02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:55.680]   Set your cloud bills in half with Linode's Linux virtual machines.
[02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:59.440]   Whether you're developing a personal project or managing larger workloads, you deserve
[02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:05.080]   simple, affordable, accessible cloud computing solutions with the best darn customer service
[02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:07.000]   ever.
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.360]   We have such a good deal for you.
[02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:10.360]   I always love it.
[02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:14.360]   I talk to these guys and I say, "Well, what can you offer our audience?"
[02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:16.560]   When they told me this, I went, "Okay.
[02:31:16.560 --> 02:31:18.760]   A hundred dollar free credit.
[02:31:18.760 --> 02:31:19.760]   Okay."
[02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:20.920]   That's because you're listening to Twig.
[02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:26.800]   You can find all the details at Linode LiNODE, Linode.com/Twig.
[02:31:26.800 --> 02:31:33.640]   Or if you're not at your desktop, just text "Twit" to 47, 47, 47 to get your free credit.
[02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:34.640]   $100.
[02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:35.640]   What?
[02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:38.440]   I was so happy when I heard that because I tell you it's very affordable.
[02:31:38.440 --> 02:31:41.160]   A hundred dollars could go a long, long way on Linode.

[02:31:51.560 --> 02:31:54.560]   I mean, I could just think of a million different things you could do.
[02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:55.560]   Linode LiNODE.com/Twig.
[02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:58.960]   It's a good thing to have in your back pocket.
[02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:00.840]   Set up the account, get the credit.
[02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:03.080]   You will find many, many ways to use it.
[02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:06.440]   Thank you, Linode, for supporting this week in Google.
[02:32:06.440 --> 02:32:10.080]   Thank you for doing it by going to linode.com/twig.
[02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:15.400]   I saw this.
[02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:21.280]   I'm so glad Matthew Ingram, you're Pick of the Week.
[02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:22.280]   Are you muted?
[02:32:22.280 --> 02:32:23.280]   Hello, Matthew?
[02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:24.280]   Yes.
[02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:25.280]   Good.
[02:32:25.280 --> 02:32:27.040]   Tell me what your Pick of the Week is.
[02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:30.000]   I saw this and I loved it.
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:31.560]   So I actually have two.
[02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:36.000]   I added a second one that someone mentioned in the chat room, which you can play or not.
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:42.840]   But it's the four-year anniversary to the day of that famous BBC interview where the
[02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:45.440]   guys' kids come wandering into the day.
[02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:46.440]   Today's the day.
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:47.440]   For a million.
[02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:49.320]   Let's watch it again.
[02:32:49.320 --> 02:32:51.720]   The best interview of 2017.
[02:32:51.720 --> 02:32:53.960]   He's on the BBC.
[02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:56.800]   He's an expert in what is it?
[02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:57.800]   The Middle East or something?
[02:32:57.800 --> 02:32:59.960]   His kid, China, that's what it was.
[02:32:59.960 --> 02:33:00.960]   It was Asia.
[02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:02.560]   His kid comes prancing in.
[02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:03.560]   He shoves him away.
[02:33:03.560 --> 02:33:07.720]   Then the little kid comes in and the roller, but the best part is this mom.
[02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:08.720]   I'm slip-sliding in.
[02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:09.720]   Perhaps the kids.
[02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:10.720]   She must have been watching.
[02:33:10.720 --> 02:33:12.720]   She must have been watching.
[02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:13.720]   Oh my God!
[02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:14.720]   Every time.
[02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:17.960]   The best part is the books.
[02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:18.960]   Look at them on the right.
[02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:21.440]   They're piled on the bed to make it look like a task.
[02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:22.440]   Yeah.
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:23.440]   He's in the bedroom.
[02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:24.440]   We know.
[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:25.440]   It's okay.
[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:26.440]   You know, it's funny.
[02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:27.520]   In 2017, this was remarkable.
[02:33:27.520 --> 02:33:28.520]   This was weird.
[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:30.240]   This was like, wow, this guy's at home in the bedroom.
[02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:32.240]   Now it's like everybody.
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:33.240]   Everybody does.
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:34.240]   Everybody does.
[02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:36.480]   We have animals invading the shows.
[02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:37.960]   We have children invading the show.
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:39.920]   It's just normal now.
[02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:40.920]   We all began.
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:45.080]   Where are they now with the daughter?
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:46.560]   She's four years older, right?
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:47.560]   Look at her.
[02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:52.160]   Yeah, there's a picture we're playing, I think, the cello or something like that.
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:57.120]   March 10, 2017, a day that will live in infamy.
[02:33:57.120 --> 02:33:58.120]   Epic.
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:00.320]   Seven other one.
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:01.320]   Yes.
[02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:03.280]   Which you may be talking about.
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:05.840]   That's the one I was talking about because I saw this on TikTok this morning.
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:06.840]   It's hysterical.
[02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:13.440]   This guy built a video store, old fashioned video rental store in his basement.
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:14.440]   It's a big one.
[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:17.360]   It is basement and it looks just like a real rental store.
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:18.360]   That is awesome.
[02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:19.360]   Yeah.
[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:21.080]   It goes on and on too.
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:22.720]   It's not just, I thought it was just a little dirty.
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:24.480]   It has an orange section behind the corner.
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:27.480]   Probably behind the curtain, little point section to beat a curtain.
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:28.840]   There's an E.T. doll.
[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:31.000]   You know, the video store has always had those gimme's.
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.840]   Instead of refitting your comments.
[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:36.760]   He decided to build a video rental store.
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:38.440]   He at owned all of these.
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:39.640]   It's wild.
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:40.640]   I guess so.
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:41.640]   He's a bit.
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:42.640]   Look at it.
[02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:43.640]   It goes on.
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:44.640]   There's a second room.
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:45.640]   There's another room over there.
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:49.160]   Does he have a sign telling him to be kind and rewind?
[02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:50.520]   The candy bar.
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:51.520]   The candy canner.
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:52.920]   Do you remember doing that?
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:53.920]   Going to the video store.
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:54.920]   Picking up Ernie.
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:56.280]   Picking the video for that night.
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:34:57.280]   Picking up some.
[02:34:57.280 --> 02:35:00.000]   I remember the, I'm old enough to remember the mom and pop video stores, right?
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.000]   Oh yeah.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:02.000]   You too.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.000]   You too.
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.000]   Before Blockbuster.
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.600]   Actually, the last video store in Petaluma just closed, it was a mom and pop store.
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:07.600]   Wow.
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:08.600]   Wild.
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:10.440]   Oh, he's got a little viewing room.
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:13.600]   It's not the first thing I would have thought of doing in my basement.
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:14.600]   No.
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:20.920]   Max is pretty much the last thing I would have thought of doing in my basement.
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:22.840]   He really went at it.
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:24.840]   He didn't just half ask it.
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:25.840]   Oh no.
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:26.840]   Yeah.
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:28.240]   I mean, you can smell the carpet.
[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:29.240]   He's really asked.
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:31.640]   You know exactly what that carpet smells like.
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:32.640]   You're there.
[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:33.640]   It's wood paneling and everything.
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:34.640]   You know.
[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:35.640]   Oh yeah.
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:36.640]   It's a little bit there.
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:37.640]   Well, that's a hoarder.
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:39.240]   Well, it's a hoarder with order.
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:41.440]   A hoarder with order is very important.
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:42.440]   Yeah.
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:45.440]   Because a hoarder without order is just a hoarder.
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:47.360]   A hoarder with order is just a nut.
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:50.000]   Jeff, you're a number of the week.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:51.680]   So this is maybe the one inside baseball.
[02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:54.200]   Matthew, you remember the journalism startup, Civil?
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:55.960]   Oh, very well.
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:56.960]   Yes.
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:35:57.960]   Yes.
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:35:59.200]   So, so it was a, and we talked about it on the show.
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:03.280]   It was a, a, a blockchain based thing.
[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:04.600]   It never made any sense.
[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:07.000]   Nobody could figure it out or understand it, just like MFTs.
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:12.600]   When you started off today with Trey before we were on the air, he mentioned MetaMask.
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:14.520]   And I said, that's it.
[02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:15.520]   That's where my money is.
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:17.040]   I couldn't remember the name MetaMask.
[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:18.440]   I couldn't remember that.
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:21.240]   So before the show goes on, I thought, can I, is it, can I do this?
[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:22.240]   I found my MetaMask.
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:23.880]   I found my code.
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:27.960]   And I had, I had $500 that I had put into civil because I'm such a nice guy.
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:28.960]   I'm schmuck.
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:32.760]   But it sat there this last two years because I didn't know how to get to the money.
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:33.760]   That's how much.
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:34.760]   That's not worth $4,656.
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:35.760]   What?
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:39.520]   I'm the only push that made money on civil.
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:40.520]   That's awesome.
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:42.320]   I know it's identical story on it or not.
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:48.400]   So I bought Ethereum or I actually had, believe it or not, some Bitcoin that I bought years
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:50.360]   ago when it first started.
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:54.200]   And I changed it into Ethereum so that I could invest in civil.
[02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:55.200]   Right.
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:59.160]   Because I thought, I thought it was worth, you know, I wanted to try it out.
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:04.480]   So then I completely forgot about it and then it wasn't until Bitcoin started going through
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:05.480]   the roof.
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:06.480]   I was like, where, where?
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:08.000]   I should go look at that.
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.960]   I went to Coinbase and they said, Oh, would you like to look at your wallet?
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:12.920]   And I was like, I have a wallet.
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:13.920]   And you sure?
[02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:16.960]   I was like $3,000 in there.
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:17.960]   Wow.
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:18.960]   So what?
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:20.840]   A civil went out of business in June.
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:21.840]   What was civil?
[02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:22.840]   What was the point of it?
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:23.840]   Civil.
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:24.840]   You don't have two hours for that.
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:30.360]   So I'll give you the, I wrote a long feature about it at CGR if you want to read it.
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:31.360]   You can't hear it.
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:33.080]   They were trying to spawn.
[02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:38.000]   The idea was they were going to use Ethereum as a payment system for journalists.
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.720]   So think about sub stack if it was based on the blockchain.
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:47.360]   So they were, they started a whole bunch or funded a bunch of newsrooms, independent
[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:53.480]   newsrooms and they were going to publish their articles using the blockchain and they were
[02:37:53.480 --> 02:38:00.560]   going to take payments in Ethereum or in something called civil that was a coin based
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:01.920]   on Ethereum.
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:08.280]   And then the company that backed them basically started tanking because Ethereum started tanking
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:11.240]   and the whole thing went down in flames.
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:17.080]   It's kind of interesting because for a long time we thought micro payments would be the
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:18.880]   solution to journalism.
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:20.240]   Well, that was the idea.
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:21.240]   I didn't.
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:22.240]   I never did.
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:23.600]   You always thought it was a bad idea.
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:26.360]   I mean, the problem was we didn't have a way to do it.
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:28.640]   PayPal would take a big chunk of any transaction.
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:30.440]   They didn't allow small transactions.
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:33.800]   So micro payments could never have made it.
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:40.640]   But once blockchain based crypto currencies existed, yes, suddenly you could do a thousand
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:42.720]   of Bitcoin to somebody.
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:46.960]   I actually don't think it was a terrible idea.
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:53.000]   The one thing they were Maria Bostil is who was part of one of the early newsrooms talked
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.600]   to me about why she wanted to publish using a blockchain.
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:02.360]   And it was so that articles could not be deleted by the police or by the courts or by
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:04.080]   yes, distributed to everybody.
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:05.080]   That's brilliant.
[02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:06.080]   Everyone.
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:07.080]   Cool.
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:08.080]   Which is actually a really interesting idea.
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:09.080]   It just taught.
[02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:10.080]   I love that.
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:11.080]   It was just so complex.
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:12.080]   Nobody was like an FT.
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:13.080]   Nobody could understand.
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:14.080]   It was too complicated.
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:15.080]   That's that me.
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:16.080]   It was way complicated.
[02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:20.760]   One of the things I went through trying to buy the things, but the funny thing was part
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:26.000]   of their part of their business model was that basically the crypto currencies would
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.320]   increase in value and it would benefit everybody.
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:29.320]   Well, it did.
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:30.320]   Sure enough.
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:31.320]   Sure enough.
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:32.320]   Sure enough.
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:34.800]   What they really needed is to do the transaction themselves.
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:38.880]   Like you just come there with a five dollars and you have an account with a certain amount
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:40.840]   of civil coin in it.
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:41.840]   That didn't work that way though.
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:43.040]   Or did it was too complicated.
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:44.040]   That's more complicated.
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:45.040]   Yeah.
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:49.280]   Plus they had to do the whole because it was considered an investment kind of.
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:51.840]   You had this whole thing where you took a quiz.
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:52.840]   Remember that Matthew?
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:53.840]   Yeah.
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:56.040]   You had to study a thing and take a quiz.
[02:39:56.040 --> 02:39:57.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:39:58.440]   Because you were an expert investor.
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:39:59.920]   They actually did that.
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:01.600]   They did that for a good reason.
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:04.360]   They didn't want people to speculate in civil coins.
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:06.960]   They wanted people who actually wanted to fund journalism.
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:07.960]   It was also the law.
[02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:10.560]   So they wanted to basically keep the speculators.
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:13.560]   Until the Jobs Act you had to actually be an expert.
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:15.680]   Otherwise you couldn't invest.
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:16.680]   That was to protect you.
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:20.320]   Well, one other quick number to mention real fast was that when the pandemic started,
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:25.720]   now that we're at our anniversaries, the joke was of course there's going to be a baby
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:27.200]   boom, right?
[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:28.720]   The opposite.
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:29.720]   Yeah.
[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:37.960]   FT has numbers that in France, births are down 13% in.
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:38.960]   Really?
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:42.880]   Yeah, it's down all across Europe.
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:43.880]   Wow.
[02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:47.200]   I think people said, oh man, I'm already stuck in this house with a kid for a year.
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:49.680]   I can't imagine having another kid.
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:50.680]   No.
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:52.480]   So huh.
[02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:53.480]   Yeah.
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:56.000]   And what's your pick of the week?
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:57.840]   Got a couple.
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:40:59.840]   I'll make them quick though.
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:04.800]   First, Adobe MAX announced its dates for 2021.
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:06.560]   And yes, it is virtual.
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:09.200]   And yes, it is free for anyone.
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:11.280]   Just create an Adobe ID.
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:12.280]   And you're good to go.
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:15.800]   And that's on October 26th through the 28th.
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:17.800]   And today they also Adobe.
[02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:23.440]   They also pushed out a bunch of updates for like Photoshop and Photoshop on iPad.
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:28.880]   And one in particular for Adobe Camera Raw that I'm looking forward to trying out is
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:32.240]   their super resolution feature.
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:36.160]   Right now if you're inside a Photoshop, you can scale up your images.
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:41.840]   It uses a bit of AI to make a smaller image larger, but you still have decent quality
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:42.840]   with it.
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:43.960]   And I thought it's pretty good.
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:46.800]   This is supposed to be exponentially better.
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:49.680]   And that's rolling out today.
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:50.760]   Yep, today.
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:54.720]   So something to check out if you're in the Adobe sphere.
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:57.920]   Lastly, this was something that it pissed me off.
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:00.080]   I saw this last weekend.
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:01.080]   It pissed me off.
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:02.080]   You're allowed.
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:04.360]   Although I can't imagine what a pissed off ant crew it would be.
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:08.480]   But there's a bit of a personal story with this.
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:12.200]   And I do have permission to share this personal story.
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:16.520]   So last weekend, there's a hotel called Montage.
[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:20.760]   It's a pretty expensive high end hotel chain.
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:23.920]   Oh, I saw your post on this.
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:30.080]   And some people were there checking in and they wanted to have some drinks and just chill
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:31.720]   out or whatnot.
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:37.800]   When the manager told them they need to go sit outside because of, suppose it COVID
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:39.440]   regulations and whatnot.
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:42.560]   Well, these are black people that this manager told.
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:44.480]   By the way, all wearing masks.
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:45.800]   All wearing masks.
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:51.480]   Yet within the same room, there were some white folks sitting right there and just doing
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:53.760]   their thing exactly like they were doing.
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:54.760]   No masks.
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:55.760]   They were told to leave.
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:57.360]   No masks.
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:03.520]   And it just really it really did piss me off because we talked to Dr. Norett last week and
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:09.960]   she went through the PR playbook and how these companies were sending out this message when
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:11.240]   this happens and that happens.
[02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:13.320]   You say this or what have you.
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:17.680]   And of course, that's exactly what these meritage, not meritage.
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:20.600]   Montage people did is they sent out a blast.
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:23.520]   Hey, we apologize and we don't believe in this.
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:24.520]   Oh my God.
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:30.040]   Taking a picture of them shooting the video of him throwing them out.
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:31.720]   Oh, appalling.
[02:43:31.720 --> 02:43:36.040]   And there are plenty of white people in this lobby walking around eating, drinking their
[02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:37.880]   but no masks.
[02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:38.880]   No masks.
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:40.880]   He's not throwing them out.
[02:43:40.880 --> 02:43:41.880]   Full crap.
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:45.000]   He totally got busted.
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:50.240]   So that pissed me off because that stuff right there is still happening today.
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:56.040]   And yep, there's not much going on under news standpoint far as that hotel stepping up
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:57.280]   and making it.
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:43:59.000]   Where was the right?
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:02.040]   This is in Laguna Beach down in Southern California.
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:03.040]   Montage.
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:08.800]   There's nothing going on about this being published to be fixed and corrected or any
[02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:13.280]   type of action.
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:14.760]   Sorry, it pisses me off.
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:15.760]   You should be pissed off.
[02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:16.760]   And we have.
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:18.800]   It's ridiculous.
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:28.560]   But yet I heard for about 10 days about Lady Gaga's dog that was stolen or whatever.
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:33.000]   Didn't hear anything about Lady Gaga's handler that was trying to take care of the dog and
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.920]   her shots that got shot.
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:38.320]   So I'm like, what is wrong with society?
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:42.560]   But the personal thing on this, that hotel chain.
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:47.800]   Now here in the Pruitt household, I'm the only one working.
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:51.120]   But Queen Pruitt has been trying to get work and she's been able to get a little part
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:53.440]   time stuff here and there because she does nail.
[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:55.000]   She's an amazing nail.
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.320]   She's done my nails and I'll vouch for it.
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:58.320]   Right.
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:01.560]   And so she's not a good time to be a nail person, I might add.
[02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:02.560]   It's all right.
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:06.400]   She's been able to get stuff here and there, but it's not full time work because of the
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:08.480]   pandemic and stuff.
[02:45:08.480 --> 02:45:15.360]   She recently had an interview, got a job and accepted and went to training and all of
[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:21.480]   this good stuff, went through the corporate ethics training and all of those things HR
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:23.160]   make you do.
[02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:24.320]   But she left.
[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:27.320]   She just wasn't filling it.
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:33.160]   And the name of that place was the montage hotel.
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:35.680]   Oh, same thing.
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:36.680]   Same thing.
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:37.680]   Her sixth cent was right.
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:40.640]   Oh, my, no wonder you're pissed off.
[02:45:40.640 --> 02:45:41.640]   Wow.
[02:45:41.640 --> 02:45:47.840]   This was about 10 days ago when she was like, you know, I'm just not filling this place
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:49.000]   because they have a version.
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.920]   They have one and they just opened a new one here in Northern California.
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:53.920]   Oh, good.
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:54.920]   I cannot stay there.
[02:45:54.920 --> 02:45:55.920]   That's exciting.
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:45:57.480]   Another place I cannot stay.
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:45:58.480]   That's great.
[02:45:58.480 --> 02:46:01.520]   Is it here in Santa Rosa?
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:02.520]   Where is the montage?
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:03.520]   No, what's up above?
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:04.520]   What's that?
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:05.520]   Hells.
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:07.040]   Oh, St. Alina, Heelsberg, Heelsberg.
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:13.200]   Heelsberg, Heelsberg.
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:18.000]   But is out there in the middle of all the venues in the South of Pute and Fula area?
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.800]   And it's, you know, she had to sign all of these forms.
[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:21.800]   Oh, that's nuts.
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:23.400]   Because we'll all be staying there.
[02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:24.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:25.400]   Not in.
[02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:27.200]   She's like, you know, I'm just not filling it.
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:31.920]   And of course, I'm like, yeah, I need you working, baby, but you're not filling it.
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:32.920]   Okay, I get it.
[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:34.840]   And then this popped up.
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:35.840]   Yeah.
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:36.840]   Yeah, right.
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:38.440]   Never, never questioned the Queen.
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:39.440]   Never.
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:40.800]   No, the Queen has a sixth sense.
[02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:43.360]   You know, that's what Prince Charles has learned.
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:44.360]   And that's what you did.
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:45.360]   Yeah.
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:48.080]   I don't blame you for Noda.
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:49.080]   Pished off.
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:51.080]   That's messed up.
[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:55.360]   But I wanted to share that and she gave me permission to share that because I think stuff
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:59.040]   like this has to continue to be brought to light.
[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:00.040]   Yeah.
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:01.040]   Yeah.
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:02.880]   This is everyday stuff going on.
[02:47:02.880 --> 02:47:03.880]   Y'all.
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:05.120]   You're here to keep us honest.
[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:06.120]   Thank you.
[02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:08.560]   Appreciate it, Mr. Ant.
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:14.440]   My pick of the week is for anybody who wants to watch YouTube without the suggestion feeds,
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:18.920]   without the comments, without all the things that make YouTube a nightmare.
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:20.080]   Just unhook YouTube.
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:25.360]   It's a Chrome Firefox or Edge extension.
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:28.680]   I've got installed right now on my Firefox.
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:30.800]   It's got a little play button.
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:37.720]   You can see all of the things you can turn off, screen video, screen cards, hide comments,
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:42.760]   hide mixed radio, hide merch tickets, offers, hide video info, hide top header, hide lifts.
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:47.800]   I give you permission to turn all of that stuff off on our feed.
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:51.320]   Disable audio, auto play, disable annotation.
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:53.840]   If you don't like it, you can turn it off.
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:55.240]   I'm not sure how they're doing it.
[02:47:55.240 --> 02:47:56.240]   Probably CSS, right?
[02:47:56.240 --> 02:47:57.240]   I don't know.
[02:47:57.240 --> 02:47:58.240]   But it's free.
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:47:59.240]   Interesting.
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:02.920]   I'm invited to donate if you want to support his work.
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:03.920]   Unhook.app.
[02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:10.600]   It's kind of like an ad block, but it's a little more specific to YouTube.
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:12.280]   There's one of those for Facebook too.
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:13.280]   I installed it.
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:14.280]   Oh, good.
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:15.280]   It's an extension.
[02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:17.120]   And you can turn off almost everything.
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:18.120]   It's fascinating.
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:19.120]   That's good.
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:21.000]   I did that too, but I just disabled my Facebook account.
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:25.600]   That was the turn off birthday is my birthday.
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:26.600]   You know what?
[02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:27.600]   I hate birthdays.
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:31.200]   I hate it when it's my birthday because I get all these things and then I have to respond
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:32.200]   to them.
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:34.840]   And I don't care because I'm old and I don't want to celebrate it.
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:35.840]   Exactly.
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:36.840]   Mark Zuckerberg, 65.
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:38.840]   He's going to say what I'm going to do.
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:39.840]   He'll know.
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:43.280]   I don't regret anything else that I did, but this birthday was the worst thing I could
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:44.280]   have.
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:48.080]   You know, well, I don't know if this happens with you guys, but there are now people who
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:49.080]   want to be the first.
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:51.280]   So they actually wish you a happy birthday before.
[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:52.280]   Yeah.
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:53.280]   That's your team.
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:54.280]   It's now.
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:55.280]   Yeah.
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:49:00.440]   At least they let you do donations to a charitable cause, which I think is nice.
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:01.440]   Yeah.
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:03.640]   At least you could do that, but still.
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:06.840]   Leo, John, there should be a bonus pick.
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:07.840]   There's a bonus pick.
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:13.480]   If John's winning in the random in flock is passing from Anthony passing along a bonus
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:14.480]   pick.
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:19.720]   This is this comes from somebody named Anthony.
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:20.720]   How?
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:21.720]   Okay.
[02:49:21.720 --> 02:49:22.720]   So he's using the MyHeritage app.
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:23.720]   Oh my God.
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:24.720]   I'm going to.
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:25.720]   Uh oh.
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:26.720]   This is actually wombo.ai.
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:29.320]   So it's not MyHeritage.
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:33.280]   It's like MyHeritage.
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:38.200]   This is from the album, Art or a picture of me.
[02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:46.120]   At the end of the show with this great meme, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:47.120]   us.
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:48.120]   Let's wake it.
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:49.120]   Go go.
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:52.040]   We do the show every Wednesday, 2 p.m.
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:53.040]   Pacific 5 p.m.
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:58.360]   Eastern until now be 2100 UTC because of course we're going back.
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:49:59.360]   Yeah.
[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:01.520]   We're going forward an hour on Sunday.
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:06.840]   Thank you, Matthew Ingram, CJR.org, and Anthony Journal, and some review.
[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:08.800]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:09.800]   Thank you.
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:10.800]   No, let's do some more MyHeritage.
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:11.800]   That's okay.
[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:12.800]   Yeah.
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:13.800]   No, come on.
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:14.800]   More MyHeritage.
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:15.800]   Oh, full screen.
[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:16.800]   It's even creepier.
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:17.800]   Thank you.
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:24.800]   We're doing a lot of work.
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:32.440]   We're going to get really, really nerdy and down into the nitty gritty of those lenses.
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:34.880]   Oh, a very special guest.
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:35.880]   Yes.
[02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:37.760]   By the way, I'm making this an NFT.
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:42.640]   If anybody wants to send me an Ethereum, I'll be glad to sell you the one and only copy.
[02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:44.760]   I've taken bids right now.
[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:48.200]   And until I get a good bid, I'm going to keep playing it.
[02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:49.200]   Say your singing.
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:52.000]   Your voice is apparently expected.
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:53.920]   I sing quite well, don't I?
[02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:55.520]   I wonder what the fox says.
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:57.520]   We could do that next.
[02:50:57.520 --> 02:51:00.520]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:04.160]   We'll see you next time on this week at Google.
[02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:05.160]   Bye-bye.
[02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:06.160]   Thanks, Leo.
[02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:13.160]   Bye-bye.
[02:51:13.160 --> 02:51:15.600]   Bye-bye.
