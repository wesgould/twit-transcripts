[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.080]   to show the covers, Google and the Google verse,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.840]   and the cloud and a great cast of characters with us today.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.880]   In fact, I'm going to go to Jeff Jarvis right away,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.080]   because he's actually in a car.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.880]   This is the first time anybody has done any show
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.560]   on the network from a moving vehicle.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.560]   Jeff Jarvis, you are--
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.560]   Yes, first.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.880]   You are a man of many talents.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.680]   He's a trailblazer.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.920]   A trailblazer.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.560]   We thought Jeff wasn't going to be on the show,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.400]   because he's just getting back from South Africa.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.000]   But I'm really pleased we can get you on, Jeff.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.040]   We also have Gina Trapani from her lair in San Diego.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.720]   Hello.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.680]   The bicycle shop.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.520]   The bicycle shop, right?
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.440]   I got my bikes on the wall.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.840]   Gina's the blogger at Originally Life Hacker.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.160]   Now, smarterware.org and joins us every week.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.560]   And two special guests just for this occasion,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.040]   Giga Ohm's Own, Ohm Malek.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.840]   Hey, gig.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.120]   Hey, I almost called you a gig.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.640]   Hey, Ohm.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.040]   Hey, gig.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.080]   What's happening?
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.280]   Your friend's called, you gig.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.440]   No, my enemy is true.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.160]   We're great to have you, Ohm, on the show.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.120]   I've done live TV.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.400]   I can't believe-- you know, I thought we'd
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.680]   had you on this week in Google before,
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.440]   but you've been on Twitter, not this week in Google.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.560]   So it's perfect timing to have you on.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.320]   You'd only have two bloggers at a time,
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.680]   and I showed it to be very honest.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.760]   Are you kidding?
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.360]   Yeah, Gina and Jeff.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.120]   Everybody else has to take a backseat.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.520]   It's all bloggers all the time.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.280]   In fact, even though Brad Stone is a reporter
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.480]   for the New York Times, he's also a blogger at their BITS blog,
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.800]   and we're glad to have you on, Brad.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.920]   You just wrote the story, a very interesting story,
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.680]   about Apple's rejection of pulse, which I'm still using
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.200]   on my iPad, at the behest of the New York Times.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.800]   Now, we should say you're not speaking for the times.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.440]   Rose here.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.200]   I'm back.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.240]   Yep, he's back.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.760]   For some reason, we have trouble with the firewall
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.080]   and the Times building, I think.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.480]   Are you there?
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.520]   Trying to keep you guys out.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.040]   I am here.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.360]   OK.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.240]   I can hear you now, Leo.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.560]   So I was just saying, you're not speaking for the New York
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.080]   Times, you're as a reporter for the New York Times.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.200]   You wrote the story on Apple and pulse.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.920]   What happened there?
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.520]   That's right.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.880]   Oh, it was sort of peculiar.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.320]   About a week ago, I spotted this application
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.520]   in the App Store for the iPad.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.280]   And it's a pretty good news aggregator.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.440]   And of course, I wrote it up.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.280]   And I talked to the Stanford Institute of Design students
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.640]   who had created it.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   And I got some indication from some of my colleagues
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.400]   that the Times actually frowned on these kinds of apps.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.520]   And I mean, look, I don't speak for the New York Times.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.120]   I'll get in trouble if I try to speak for the New York Times.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.640]   I tried to cover that story yesterday like everybody else.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.560]   My perception is that the main objection
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.280]   is an news organization like the Times
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.600]   is trying to have a website on one hand and an app on the other.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.040]   And we're trying to do different things.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.200]   And we might ultimately try to do different things economically
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.840]   with those properties.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.560]   And pulse just goes very creatively.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.320]   It links the two.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.320]   It's taking our website.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.360]   It's presenting it within its app.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.520]   And it's bracketing our website with its own content,
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.960]   its own application.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.640]   And I think that's where some of the discomfort was created.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.280]   And you guys know the rest.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.480]   I actually think the New York Times editor's choices
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.640]   is actually a very nice way to read the New York Times.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.560]   But it's limited.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.520]   It's a very first step in there with it.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.720]   Yeah, it's not all the content.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.320]   And I think it's because we're waiting for the paywall
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.480]   and for the rest of the strategy to come along.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.640]   I'm curious like everybody else.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.840]   I'm sorry that Jeff is just going in from the car
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.000]   to his house right now because I would love to get his--
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.640]   The person who you're trying to read is currently unavailable.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.240]   Well, at least we got him on for a little bit.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.640]   We'll get him back once he gets inside the house.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.240]   I'm sure Jeff will have an opinion on that.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.680]   Well, he's against these paywalls.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.000]   And he thinks it's crazy to do this.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.200]   And it was Virginia Heffron.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.960]   And I thought, kind of astutely, we talked about this last week,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.760]   wrote in the Times Sunday times a couple of weeks ago
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.960]   about how these apps are really the suburbs
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.720]   compared to the inner city of the World Wide Web
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.440]   with all of its rough and tumble elements.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.360]   And I'm sorry to interrupt there.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.480]   I just-- this whole episode reminds me of this quote
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.200]   by Mahatma Gandhi, which he somewhat like, first, they ignore
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.880]   you, then they laugh at you, and they fight you.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.640]   And then you win.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.320]   And I think that's exactly what is going on.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.240]   I don't think-- I'm not talking about grad hair,
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.840]   but I think the New York Times can't seem to--
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.480]   and like many of the large institutions in this world,
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.360]   can't seem to understand that we live in a society of--
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.760]   where things are going around the people who
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.400]   are creating blocks in whatever they do,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.560]   whether they are the big banks, the government, the media,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.200]   whatever it is, there is a route around mentality,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.040]   which has become pervasive in a whole generation of people
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.560]   who've been empowered with the internet.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.960]   And I think what you're seeing is this fighting
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.680]   the news aggregators.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.800]   I mean, really, can you really fight that?
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.760]   Like, can you-- it's like saying some kids basically
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.120]   clip times and create a short version of it
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.800]   and z-rox it and give it to their friends.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.000]   I mean, how is that different?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.240]   Yeah, I'm not sure how Paul says different from a ton
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.360]   of other news aggregators, which I use.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.760]   I mean, I think this is--
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.480]   and the fact is that the world is very different.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.840]   I think-- and the bigger issue, which I think Jeff
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.720]   can address to give him that he spends a lot of his time
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.880]   in the media world and the new post-internet media world,
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.560]   I think we don't seem to quite understand
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.920]   the harsh reality of our businesses, the media industry,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.720]   is that we are looking to redefine the future
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.760]   with the rules of yesterday.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.260]   Well--
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.960]   ideas from yesterday.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.800]   That's not going to happen.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.560]   You know, there are some pro-isms,
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.120]   right like as Kletch, Erky, and Jay Rotten say,
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.760]   that the value of content isn't going to go away.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.720]   A New York Times story is not going to go away.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.400]   But one needs to think differently
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.840]   about what is information and what is insight
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.080]   and what is a newspaper and how it needs to be delivered.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.520]   I think looking at ideas, which are from yesterday,
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.880]   and saying, I am going to deliver it to the world in that
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.200]   manner, it's not going to work.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.640]   It just is not--
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.200]   Let me raise one.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.480]   I agree with you all.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.560]   And by the way, it's not just the newspaper industry.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.360]   It's the music industry, the television industry.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.720]   That means every content company right now that--
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.480]   It seems to me that there's a sort of simple issue here.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.680]   Apple itself has created or really nurtured
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.000]   this distinction of applications.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.800]   And applications are not the wide world of the web.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.240]   They're a curated entertainment or content experience.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.080]   And it seems like what the New York Times is trying to do here
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:18.720]   is to preserve that possibility that it can create
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.840]   a differentiated experience on its own.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.200]   And then possibly that experience
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.320]   might be worth something to some of our fans.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.240]   What Pulse was doing was sort of blending the two categories.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.040]   It was taking the wide world of the web
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.720]   and bringing it into their own app experience.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.200]   Was it because Pulse was not free?
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.120]   Was that some of the issue?
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.840]   You know, as I said before, I felt
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.680]   part of the company's response to it was muddled.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.840]   So I'm not sure how much that made a difference.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.520]   Jeff, what's your take on this?
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.600]   Unfortunately, we lost Jeff right in the middle
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.320]   of this conversation.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.280]   We're talking about the iPad application, Pulse News,
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.120]   which was written by a group of Stanford students, was, in fact,
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.800]   shown by Steve Jobs on the stage at the WWDC on Monday.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.000]   And on Tuesday, pulled by Apple from the App Store
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.680]   because of complaints from the New York Times.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.080]   And I should underscore again that Brad works for the New York
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.640]   Times, is not speaking for the New York Times,
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.080]   he's speaking as a reporter.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.000]   And I did ping Martin Dis and Olds from the Times,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.080]   but I was about to get on a plane from South Africa
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.560]   so I couldn't go any farther with him.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.520]   I just don't see how you cannot want
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.960]   to be part of something like Pulse.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.720]   That's good.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.920]   That's going to send readers.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.080]   And I had this discussion with a reporter at the LA Times
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.320]   who just put up a story about the Las Vegas Sun suing
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.320]   people like a cat blogger for putting up a whole story.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.560]   People shouldn't put up whole stories,
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.880]   but this was a poor cat blogger, put up one story once,
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.440]   and now they're selling the copyright to someone else to sue.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.840]   My point is that I don't think we've studied
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.760]   yet the real value of the different kinds of links
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.600]   that we have.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.240]   I know that I put up my entire blog, rather,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.440]   I'll listen to me, in RSS.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.320]   I've had it up on Business Insider,
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.280]   and I've had it up elsewhere.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.200]   And I get more traffic and more results as it is.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.000]   I think that it was in the New York Times two years ago
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.200]   that a college student said, if the news is that important,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.680]   it will find me.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.200]   We cannot be so heuristic to think that people will always
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.880]   come to us as if our brands are magnetic.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.000]   And so I think the Times has to figure out
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.440]   how to be part of this distributed world.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.280]   It has an RSS feed.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.800]   It has an API.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.520]   It needs to be part of experiences all over.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.280]   And Brad, I think you're right that editors want
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.640]   to create this experience, but I think the problem there
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.800]   is it's not the experience, it's the ego of control.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.720]   - Actually, can I interrupt you there for one minute here?
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.880]   There's a couple of points if you really think about it.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.440]   So about 26% of New York Times.com traffic
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.360]   comes from sources not New York Times, OK?
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.200]   The Google, Facebook, Grudge Report, things like that.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.440]   So it behooves them to actually encourage people
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.320]   to actually link to them and take their information
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.440]   in many different places.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.640]   So Paul says a good example of that.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.160]   And the second example of it is that if you really think about it,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.960]   is it New York Times's fault?
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.760]   Perhaps not.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.440]   I will step back and take whose fault is it
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   that this kind of thinking has become all pervasive.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.160]   And I think a lot of it is the fault of Madison Avenue,
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.880]   because they don't innovate around the idea of advertising.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.520]   And basically, they have imposed this idea
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.040]   that everything has to be page view or eyeball driven.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.280]   And those eyeballs have to have the metrics
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.160]   which they're used traditionally.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.600]   And I think this is why companies like New York Times
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.160]   are also reacting towards the guys like Paul's and saying,
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.720]   OK, we don't need to help these guys out.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.480]   And I think a lot of it is a fault for the business model.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.360]   And the business model, I would say
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.680]   we need to take it all the way back to Madison Avenue.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.000]   I think it's a whole cause and effect.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.320]   It's not just New York Times banning the pulse.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.720]   The whole ecosystem has to kind of
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.640]   in need a futuristic forward looking brand new thinking.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.040]   That's all.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.360]   - newsinnovation.com, Almond.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.760]   We did a lot of work on this, Acuny.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.520]   I agree that we need new models.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.080]   I think this response here, rather than taking down the app,
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.080]   I wish that Apple had notified Pulse
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.840]   and Pulse had pulled down the New York Times.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.280]   - That may be by the way what has happened,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.640]   because it's still on the app store.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.240]   When it kind of went down, they went back up.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.160]   It's kind of nobody knows why it's back up.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.880]   If that's an error.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.520]   - I also think they made new words.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.360]   - They've done this before.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.480]   Had contact, right, did they contact the application
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.920]   at all first before sending the season?
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.160]   Is this letter?
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.560]   Was there any context from New York Times to Pulse?
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.680]   - I don't know.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.200]   My understanding was we sent a letter to Apple.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.360]   I sent a letter to Apple.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.040]   - Right, Apple, yeah.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.000]   So that's a shame too.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I think in the times that's done this in the past
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.400]   where the executives at the times are forward thinking,
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.200]   I know a lot of them, but a lawyer gets in the way
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.880]   and it hurts the brand.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.560]   It hurts the times.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.240]   - Here's the question.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.560]   Oum, do you do a full text feed of giga Oum in your RSS?
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.760]   - Yes, I do.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.800]   - As do I.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.600]   - Gina and you do a full text feed, right?
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.480]   - I do a full text feed of my personal site.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.360]   Life hacker stopped doing a full text feed,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.960]   which was something that I thought was a terrible,
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.680]   terrible idea and I was pretty vocal about it
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   as was Adam Pash, who's the current lead editor.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.560]   But that was a change.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.360]   - So most forward thinking modern properties
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.640]   do full text feeds in their RSS.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.640]   You can subscribe to it in something like net news wire,
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.720]   Google Reader, and see the entire context.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.880]   - This is the thing, like as a developer.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.200]   - Hang on a second, Jeff Guardian did it in the traffic.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.760]   - Guardian put up full text about a year ago
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.720]   and found their traffic never went down as a result.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   - Traffic went down.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.080]   - Okay.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.040]   - But did not go down.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:45.680]   - Or didn't go down.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.040]   - Okay.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.720]   - Did not go down.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.760]   Go ahead, Gina, I'm sorry.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.040]   - As a developer, I mean, I may be getting hung up
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.320]   on an irrelevant technical detail,
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.720]   but what PULSE does is just embeds the WebKit engine
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.920]   into a new window.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.160]   It is essentially another browser,
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.760]   so it would be as if Opera charged $399,
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.720]   to download and install just a web browser.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.120]   And the times were saying,
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.640]   "You can't look at our content in a web browser."
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.200]   I mean, I don't understand why.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.560]   - It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.640]   - It doesn't make sense.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.640]   I mean, technically the PULSE window,
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.360]   PULSE isn't wrapping it in, it's a web browser.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.520]   It's just a window that runs WebKit
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.560]   just the same way that Mobile Safari does.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.560]   The reason why they do it that way
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.960]   is that they don't want the user to have to launch Safari
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.080]   and leave PULSE, right?
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.360]   Because the iPhone didn't,
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.560]   or the iPad doesn't really do,
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.000]   well it didn't do multitasking really at the time.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.880]   So I don't understand what the argument could be
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.200]   against selling what's essentially a web browser.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.760]   I mean, it sounds like the times problem
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.160]   was that it was using the Times brand to sell PULSE,
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.680]   the app, but I'm not sure.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.680]   And I won't put that on the top.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.400]   - They did, and then maybe that's all it was.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.840]   They did in the App Store have a screen cap of the Times.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.640]   - Then it was one of the default--
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.760]   - It's in the API, I have the default feeds,
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.640]   and that's what's in here along with
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.760]   Delicious and--
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.840]   - I know a lot of sites--
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.680]   - By the way, Buzz machine.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.920]   - That would be frilled.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.360]   - A lot of sites would be thrilled
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.680]   to have that kind of place on this.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.880]   - I say it's simple, PULSE should drop the Times.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.160]   Period, go on a play, fine, don't play,
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.920]   and let's see who wishes for it.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.280]   - Well now, by the way, PULSE is a news reader.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.640]   I can, it'll sync with my Google Reader,
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.360]   so if I have the New York Times as I do,
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.680]   I have all of your feeds in here,
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   all of the New York Times feeds in here.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.240]   It'll just show up right again.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.840]   I mean, guys, they could block it.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.880]   - Yeah.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.720]   - I mean, that's, and maybe if you pose that question
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.040]   to the Times, well, would you like us to block it?
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.040]   I wonder what they're answering with me.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:39.880]   - The Times can block it.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.960]   The Times and the robots.txt can block it
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.960]   if they don't like the client.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.960]   I mean-- - That's true.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.680]   - Well, it's an RSS feed though, Gina, isn't it?
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.360]   So, isn't that different?
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.200]   Is RSS have a robots.txt?
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.080]   - Yeah, you can use robots.txt to block access
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.800]   to any type of files, an RSS file is just an XML file,
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.400]   and you can say the PULSE client,
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.360]   don't deliver this XML file to the PULSE client.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.000]   - I think these three-- - As long as PULSE honors it.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.480]   - Right, as long as PULSE is sending its user agent,
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.360]   honestly, being honest about who it is,
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.400]   saying I'm the PULSE agent, which I'm sure that it is,
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.080]   I, you know, any well-behaved client does that,
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.720]   then the Times can say don't serve these feeds to this agent.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.560]   That seems really weird though.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.400]   I mean, that would be like the Times saying,
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.600]   you know, no news reader should be able to grab our RSS feed
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.280]   and use it.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.840]   It's just that it was-- - It's stupid, Caesar,
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.520]   newspapers, the panic is leading to efforts to circle
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.400]   the wagons, the phrase I used for the Federal Credit Commission,
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.080]   and it's really too bad.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.480]   And again, I'm not sure this happens at every quarter
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.400]   of every company, but I think somewhere in some quarter
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.840]   or somebody says, get the bastards,
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.680]   and doesn't realize that they're not feaving,
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.800]   they're giving a great gift of audience.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.240]   - I think panic's a good word. - But I'm happy to read
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.400]   the BBC and the Guardian and the Telegraph
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.000]   and the Washington Post and other things in PULSE.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.720]   If I only had that. - Panic's a good word.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.920]   It seems like scared a little bit, right?
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.960]   - No, I don't, again, I don't want to be put in the position
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.120]   of defending my employer. - You're not, you're not.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.960]   - Rad is not speaking for the New York Times ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.680]   - No, but I just, I feel like there was something
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.520]   that was carefully considered here,
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.200]   and it may, this may be futile, but you know,
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.720]   the Times, like a lot of other news organizations
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.120]   is developing along two tracks.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.120]   There's the website, and then there's the more curated,
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.120]   more media rich, more user friendly app experience.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.120]   And it's trying to control that distinction.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.800]   And PULSE really muddies it, and that bottom line
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.400]   is what Gina put her finger on.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.720]   It's either it's opening up the web browser within the app,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.760]   or it's doing whatever the other app does,
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.920]   whatever Twitter app does, which is generating
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.040]   that Safari window outside so that the users
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.400]   are not confused, they are going to the web.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.080]   - The users not, Brad, I understand you position here
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.400]   and it's a delicate one, and I really appreciate you being here
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.080]   because I know how difficult it is.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.560]   So not trying to argue with you, but the users aren't dumb.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.760]   And the problem is that I worked with designers for years
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.960]   and editors who want to control this experience,
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.240]   and that's part of the problem.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.240]   I just had it back and forth with Chris Anderson,
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.280]   the editor of Wired, let's repeat Wired Magazine,
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.040]   who bragged on Twitter, and I quote,
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.520]   "About a third of Wired Magazine content is now iPad
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.160]   and print only, not web."
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.880]   And I responded, and you're bragging about this why?
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.560]   (laughing)
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.520]   This is Wired, Wired!
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.560]   - Right.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.400]   - I'm saying that the web has passed away.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.200]   - You're saying that this is kind of swimming upstream
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.080]   that everybody can use a browser now to do it,
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.360]   and nobody would, in their right mind,
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.160]   well, I guess Robert Murdoch would,
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.600]   put up a pay wall against a browser.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.520]   I think the Times is doing some interesting things
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.800]   you have now, I was taking an interactive test
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.280]   on the Times web page yesterday.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.720]   There's some stuff going on.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.400]   You've resurrected, you've got a new text section.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.960]   - I think the most important thing the Times has done,
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.440]   and I'm not saying this is not coming to you, Brad,
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.560]   and saying it with you word here,
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.440]   is in fact, bits and blogs like it.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.600]   That has brought an entirely new voice
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.840]   to even the print New York Times
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.840]   that I never thought would happen.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.800]   - And is this the inside technology?
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.200]   Is that the new thing that you're doing?
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.360]   Isn't there a new section, Brad, in the Times now?
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.520]   - Well, I'm not sure what you're talking about.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.520]   We do a podcast every week,
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.920]   and no, I mean, we, as OAM knows,
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.840]   we're multi-platform now,
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.080]   and we're doing the blog,
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.960]   and the blog gets, we do a roundup for the paper,
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.840]   we do stories for the web that make it into the paper,
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.800]   and then vice versa,
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.080]   and the distinctions are all blurred.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.360]   That, what you're showing now is just our tech vertical page,
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.080]   and so that's where we kind of aggregate all the content.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.160]   - Right, right.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.280]   But you've got personal tech,
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.600]   you've got inside technology,
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.840]   you've got videos, you've got interactive tests and things.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.960]   I took a test yesterday on my attention span,
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.720]   and the Times site.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.160]   - Not bad, wasn't real.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.080]   - Not bad.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.400]   Well, actually, you know what, I didn't finish it.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.320]   I got distracted.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.160]   (laughing)
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.000]   - I'm not kidding.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.560]   (laughing)
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.400]   - I got through a couple of--
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.240]   - There were your results.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.080]   - It was too much work.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.680]   Yeah, it was too much work.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.000]   But I think that's very interesting,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.320]   and what I really think is interesting
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.920]   is that you can do the circuit section
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.760]   in the print newspaper,
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   and I think it's reasonable because people like me
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.200]   who don't want tech information
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.400]   are much more likely to go to a website like this
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.320]   and read this on the web than we are.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.800]   - That goes to Holmes.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.840]   That goes to Holmes point though,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.520]   that was killed not for editorial reasons,
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.320]   or audience reasons, but advertising reasons.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.280]   - I think the interesting conversation,
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.280]   first of all, I can understand two things about Times.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.840]   First of all, it is not for only us or the adopters.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.600]   So we have to be careful as to just tiring them entirely.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.280]   So they have a big platform which caters
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.120]   who have a lot of different markets,
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.760]   so they have their own issues.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.360]   Secondly, I think there are many people
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.120]   in their management are quite aware of the severity
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.800]   of the situation as far as news industry is concerned
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   and how they need to reinvent it.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   With that said, I think the biggest problem I see,
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.040]   not just with them, but with most media companies
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.320]   that they keep looking backwards to go forward.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.000]   And that's not how you walk.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.520]   You look backwards, you're gonna run into a pole.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.480]   That just is common sense.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.200]   And the second thing you really have to realize,
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.360]   so there is a lot of talk about building paid products
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.200]   and putting firewalls.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.920]   And we have a paid product.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.640]   It's called Gigaume Research.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.960]   It's not a product which is,
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   we've been giving away for free for so many years.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.800]   You can't get up one day and say,
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.000]   I'm going to charge for this product
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.120]   which I've been giving away for so many decades
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.080]   because people are not gonna deal with that.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.120]   Instead, you figure out new things people will pay for.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.880]   It will be a smaller business.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.400]   It will be a subset of your audience.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.920]   You need to be very, very creative how you make money.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.000]   I think that's the big difference people
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.080]   are not coming to terms with.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.840]   And I think it is just amazing to see everybody.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.880]   I mean, these are the guys I look up to
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.320]   when I think about building a company,
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.960]   a media company is traditional media giants
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   and they're still not embracing today's reality.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.720]   People will only pay for new things or different things.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.200]   Things they think have value.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.080]   They can put an actual return on investment value
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.480]   on some kind of content they will pay for.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.760]   I think that's the big difference.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.080]   I mean, I don't know, I'm granting a little bit, but.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.880]   No, no, and this is a conversation we love to talk about.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.160]   We're gonna take a break, come back.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.920]   Brad did write an article about antitrust and Google.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.520]   We're gonna talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.480]   Of course, Apple had its WWDC and Steve did use the G word.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.200]   In fact, surprisingly responded a little bit
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.600]   to Google's attacks at Google I/O.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.560]   We'll talk about that in iPhone 4 versus Android.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.440]   And I'll be interested to see how many of the panelists
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.520]   who are currently using Android phones
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.280]   may be thinking of an iPhone.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.600]   But before we do that, I'd like to welcome a new sponsor
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.000]   to the show, Slingbox.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.880]   We're very glad to have Slingbox here.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.800]   In fact, I've been using Slingbox for ages.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.640]   It's a great way to watch your favorite TV shows
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.880]   when you're away from home.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.400]   Slingbox is very simple to set up.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.720]   In fact, if you go right now to Best Buy
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.920]   or slingbox.com/twit, you could pick up a Slingbox,
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.400]   bring it home, attach it to your TV system,
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.160]   and that includes your DVR, your DVD, your cable,
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.360]   your satellite, whatever it is,
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.280]   all this stuff, in fact.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.200]   Not just one, but this has got many connections
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.760]   that you use.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.200]   Connect that Slingbox to the internet and done.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.600]   You're ready to go.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:56.600]   You're ready to, I mean, literally leave the house
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.200]   because Slingbox lets you now watch your local television
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.160]   anywhere you can get online with a Mac, with a PC,
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.480]   with an iPod Touch connected via Wi-Fi, with an iPhone.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.080]   Soon, with other devices, which shall remain nameless.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.920]   That you can--
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.200]   - I have a question about the Slingbox.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.040]   - Yeah.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.560]   - If I set up a Slingbox in my New York apartment
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.280]   with my sister, I could watch shows three hours early
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.320]   on the West Coast.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.400]   - You could watch the Robin Bird Show.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.880]   Anytime you wanted.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.480]   I know that's what you want.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.000]   - I've been thinking about it.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.680]   - You could see Glee at 6 p.m.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.160]   San Diego time.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.520]   - Glee at 6 p.m.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.360]   Glee at dinner.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.200]   That's what I want.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.200]   That's why I love any of the Slingbox.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.040]   That's it.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.880]   I've been thinking about it for a long time.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.720]   I want to set it up that way.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   - Absolutely.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.760]   - You know, here's a crazy use.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.680]   You can watch TV in your own house
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.040]   as you wander around through the internet in your house.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:48.880]   I can't wait.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.680]   I believe there's an iPad version in beta
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   and this will be so cool to be able to say,
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.760]   this is my TV.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.080]   Anywhere I go, I can watch my Slingbox.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.960]   I can already do that on my iPhone and my iPod Touch.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.840]   I mean, it really is very, very cool.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.400]   - Of course, if you're doing that over 3G,
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.200]   the new AT&T data limit.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.040]   So--
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.520]   - Oh, we'll get your radio customers.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.360]   - Ah, wow.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.200]   - Ah.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.520]   (laughing)
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.920]   - Just annoying as heck.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.400]   Well, but then just go out and get a My-Fi or something.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.680]   You know, use Verizon.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.800]   There's ways.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.320]   There's lays and ways.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.160]   - Go to--
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.000]   - I was thinking about that today.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.840]   I think that becomes,
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.440]   if you can get an unlimited My-Fi,
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.960]   then you just go pure data
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.120]   and you get rid of everything else, right?
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.360]   - Right.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.200]   - Why not?
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.040]   In fact, you can watch my iPhone or on your iPad
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:33.880]   or anything you want.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.600]   - The three of us, Gina, Jeff,
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.360]   and I can use 2.2, Android 2.2,
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.200]   and use T-Mobile unlimited.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.120]   I mean, maybe--
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.880]   - Just to be clear, Leo,
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.320]   there is no such thing as unlimited.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.160]   - I know.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.000]   It's five gigabytes on there.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.600]   - Five gigabytes and--
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.160]   - Sprint had real unlimited for a while.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.720]   Like unlimited, unlimited.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.480]   And then somebody yelled at them.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.600]   Anyway, that's neither here nor there.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.400]   Slingbox.com/twit, believe me,
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.440]   five gigabytes is plenty.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.800]   And if you're worried about missing the finals
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.040]   as you hit the road or if,
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.840]   you know, a great use for this would be in the ballpark
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.560]   or in the stadium.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.120]   And get the instant replay.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.320]   You're watching everybody goes,
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.480]   what happened, what happened?
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.760]   'Cause you know,
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.640]   slingbox.com/twit.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.520]   It is, you know,
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.800]   this is the modern way to watch TV.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.880]   Thank you, Slingbox, for your support of this week.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.720]   And Google.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.720]   Wait, what should we talk about?
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.920]   There's a lot to talk about.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.320]   You wanna talk about AT&T and bandwidth?
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.640]   Oh, Malek.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.640]   - Oh, not that.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.720]   I just wanna know from you guys,
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.360]   what do you make of the caffeine upgrade from Google?
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.960]   - Ah, the new search.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.120]   Now, Gina, I'm gonna ask Gina this.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.280]   'Cause I think of all, you know,
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.680]   Jeff, you've been in South Africa.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.080]   I'm an idiot.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.680]   Gina, can you tell that this search--
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.000]   - Gina the rescue.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.240]   - Gina the rescue.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.640]   Is there a difference?
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.440]   - I've been trying to figure out like what's different.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.760]   I'm not really sure what the details are.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.640]   What the technical details are,
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.680]   the result is that it's just a lot faster
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   and stuff gets, shows up a lot faster.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.960]   So, search results picked up quickly
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.400]   and get shown faster.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.000]   I think they're throwing around big numbers, like 50%.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I honestly didn't do a whole lot of tests on my own.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.360]   - They say, they don't say faster.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.240]   They say 50% fresher.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.080]   - Oh, fresher.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.960]   - What does that, what the hell does that mean?
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.240]   - So, I guess that just means that, you know,
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.000]   pages that go up, a blog post that goes up,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.040]   shows up in search results for,
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.600]   you know, Google search results a lot faster,
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.480]   you know, culture to publish time.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.840]   So, new content gets up.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.640]   - So, this is in a way they're moved towards real time.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.760]   - Yes, that's what it seems like.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.920]   - With caffeine, according to information week,
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.160]   Google crawls the web in smaller portions.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.960]   That's what I've been trying to do in my diet.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.840]   And updates the index on a continuous basis.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.680]   So, instead of like churning, churning, churning,
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.920]   indexing, indexing, indexing.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.920]   Okay, now you have the results.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.840]   It's turning it over faster and faster.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.720]   - Isn't like there's a, I think the underlying reality
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.720]   of this update is places like Twitter, right?
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.520]   Like they've actually changed how quickly information
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.720]   is consumed and disseminated.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.240]   And I think Google is trying to keep up with this,
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.480]   with this new, more current, you know, web.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:28.360]   And secondly, it also speaks to their single biggest strength,
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.920]   which is, I guess my angle on this story is,
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.480]   is the infrastructure they have,
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.480]   this big giant network they own, you know,
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.240]   millions of, you know, devices, servers they have.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.880]   And how they use all that to their advantage.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.880]   And I think this is a sign by being able to crawl
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.120]   the web, index it and, you know, spew it out
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.800]   for all of us to use in a more real time fashion,
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.040]   is that guys are being, they don't have a freaking hope.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:58.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.800]   I mean, they just don't.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.200]   They will, they are catching, trying to catch up
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.000]   with the car, which is going at 300 miles an hour.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.400]   And they just started driving.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.560]   And I think that's the big story here.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.520]   It's like, how they can do all this at such rapid speed
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.440]   is just amazing.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.840]   It is, it is the miracle of technology
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.720]   if you come to think of it.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.840]   So the, the now I am seeing, when you see latest results
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.920]   for caffeine for a long time, that was Twitter
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.840]   and maybe Facebook.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.360]   And now I see newspapers, Akira Daily News
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.920]   is in this real time feed.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.840]   So clearly they see real time as more
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.920]   than just social media.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.400]   They see real time as, as even news results.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.880]   That is, that seems to me to be quite a bit of a change.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.200]   And also I like this.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.720]   They also recommend, maybe you were looking
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.800]   for nicotine, quinine, capsaicin or theofyline.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.120]   - Whoa.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.280]   - Ah, okay.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.000]   - It seems like instead of, I mean,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.680]   this really is the miracle of having so many terabytes
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.760]   of storage and CPU cycles behind them.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.440]   I mean, so it seems like before the old index
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.800]   was just kind of like this stack.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   You know, these layers that would move up the stack
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.160]   over a course of like two weeks,
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.680]   a layer of the stack wouldn't get updated.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.520]   But with caffeine, it's a constant cycle of iterative.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.760]   Things get pushed through the cycle of index
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.360]   to results a lot faster and a lot more iterably.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.160]   And, you know, short little bits.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.960]   It's kind of like the difference between, you know,
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.840]   back in the days of box software where updates would come out,
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.120]   you know, a big update would come out
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.960]   and they'd ship the box out and go on the shelves here,
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.840]   you know, of your local store.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.960]   But now with web apps, small changes, iteratively pushed,
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.680]   you know, weekly, a couple times a week.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.200]   That's generally, you know, most active websites
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.720]   get updated very, very quickly, iteratively,
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.080]   and then small bytes like that.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.320]   - Here's buzzmachine.com updated nine hours ago.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.760]   Let's see what smarterware.org updated one minute ago,
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.760]   Gina, will you win?
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.120]   - Whoa, nice.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.120]   (laughing)
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.120]   - I'm gonna play.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.960]   - Hey!
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.600]   - Do you not have to post any things since yesterday?
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.440]   - Let's see, keep going.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.280]   - Okay.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.120]   - Let's see how fast gigo-ome cashed.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.640]   Doesn't say, let me see, New York Times,
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.960]   let's see how fast, three minutes ago, Gina, you win.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.800]   - Wow.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.600]   - I'm not gonna put Leo, Leoville is gonna be,
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.160]   'cause I have an update in six months,
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.440]   there's no reason for them to update it,
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.640]   that's for sure.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.480]   Yeah, it doesn't.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.760]   - Well, there's something wrong with their algorithm then,
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.120]   because I don't post as often as buzz machine and gigo-ome.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.800]   - No, I was on a plane for 18 hours, so.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.840]   - It's just chance, we just hit it at the right time,
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.160]   I'm sure.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.960]   - Work on your exponential back off Google.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.880]   (laughing)
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.920]   - And here I was saying nice things about them.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.760]   (laughing)
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.320]   - I'm fast.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.160]   - Let me ask you on the flip side of the equation,
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.920]   enough of being nice to Google, right?
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.840]   That's it, done.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.680]   - Done.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.200]   - I wanna ask Brad this question, if possible.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:49.120]   Brad, you've written a lot about how Twitter is changing
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.280]   people's search habits.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.080]   Do you feel that we are actually at that point
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.320]   where Google is beginning to worry about this whole
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:03.240]   real time data, real time information,
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.000]   how we as a society are beginning to consume it
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.680]   through Facebook and Twitter?
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.160]   You think they are increasingly worried,
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.280]   and that's why they're increasing the speed of their index
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.600]   and the crawl and everything else?
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.080]   - You know what?
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.840]   It's interesting you should ask that.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.480]   I have found that Google has integrated the content
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.480]   from Twitter into search results.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.320]   Bing has taken a slightly different approach
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.720]   and still keeps it siloed.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.320]   And I've actually been struck by how awkward
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.920]   the real time results can look in a Google search results page.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.120]   You're getting kind of the raw,
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.800]   the raw thoughts of people on Twitter,
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.400]   whatever you're searching on.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.520]   Ideally, Google's looking at some of the more credible people
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.440]   and algorithmically routing their thoughts in,
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.120]   but it's still kind of off.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:03.200]   And I wonder if it's, and you guys can disagree with this,
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.880]   but it might be sort of a failed experiment
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.520]   and that the richness of the real time web
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.120]   is more to be found in the links people are sharing.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.160]   Google can sort of mine that information
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.640]   for, you know, to refine search results.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.360]   But the actual real time content,
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:26.360]   you know, maybe with examples like news events,
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.840]   put those aside, but for most searches
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.480]   where real time's not really quite making a difference
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.640]   and speed, although on things like,
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.080]   you know, the speed of an update of a web result,
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.120]   it's a great thing to have.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.640]   And you can see why caffeine will be very valuable there.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.720]   The actual real time content sort of isn't a great fit.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.160]   What do you guys think about that?
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.200]   I think you're on something there.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.000]   I think it's, I wouldn't call it a failed experiment.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.760]   I think that's going way too far.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.440]   I think that there's a difference in expectation
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.680]   of what we see there and Google needs to refine this.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.480]   Leo, can I use my numbers a week now?
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.560]   - Yeah, sure, why not?
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.360]   - All right, just spit it out.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.080]   4.7 billion, which is the latest number four bit.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.880]   - Complete links. - Yeah.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.080]   - And they're expensive. - 4.7 billion a day.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:14.920]   Is it a day?
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.080]   - How about a month? - A month, okay.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.320]   - 4.7 billion clicks a month, Bitly.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.280]   Google to publishers, not to all sites,
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.880]   but to publishers, 4 billion a month.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.760]   Google News, 1 billion a month.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.040]   Again, Bit apples and comm quads, but still--
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.760]   - And most of those Bitly links are through Twitter,
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.160]   probably. - Right, they're through Twitter
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.240]   and there's, but the point is that doesn't include Facebook
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.080]   and the other thing else.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.920]   So Brad, you're way right is what we're seeing
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.360]   is the power of the human links and the human recommendations.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.720]   I think could well, I'll say it,
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.480]   could eclipse the power of Google at some point.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.000]   And so Google sees that and Google's trying to figure out
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.840]   how to integrate that.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.640]   I think the only thing is they haven't figured out
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.760]   how to integrate it yet.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.360]   So I think you're right, there's a slight disconnect
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.120]   of experiences because we're used to Google being more
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:03.720]   long-term definitive relevant and here comes this live stuff.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.840]   But I think it's just the beginning of figuring that out.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.160]   I think the other issue which we never talk about,
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.080]   mostly because we always focus on technology.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.080]   But if you really look at Twitter and Facebook,
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.720]   what they're doing is they're essentially
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.280]   changing user behavior, right?
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.240]   Our expectations of interacting with the web
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.440]   have gone from a single box to a very different
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.120]   kind of an internet, right?
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.280]   That one of the reasons Google became so successful
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.600]   was it changed our behavior from portals
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.280]   and in a pretty marginal search experience
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.240]   to a very simple, highly effective search experience.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.880]   So we became addicted to the idea of searching constantly.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.880]   Now we are slowly and slowly getting addicted
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.680]   to the idea of information being surfaced by people
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:59.400]   who are in our friends or in the social circle
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.120]   or whatever you wanna call them,
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.480]   people we loosely know, right?
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.680]   And I think that's a big, that has to be a big issue
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.520]   for Google.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.560]   I mean, they have to be worried about that,
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.600]   but I think that is a much more profound shift
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.280]   in the web right now,
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.040]   the how people interact with information,
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.560]   not just the technology aspect of it.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.840]   I don't think from a technology aspect,
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.520]   Google has to worry anything.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.200]   The only big worry in my opinion is how people
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.960]   are beginning to find and consume information.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.320]   (mouse clicking)
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.600]   Let's, we're gonna move on.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.840]   Apple's Big Worldwide Developers Conference was this week.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.840]   Steve Jobs took the stage on Monday,
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.800]   did take a few pot shots at Google,
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.000]   but the real pot shot at Google
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.680]   might have happened in the changed terms
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:51.480]   of the developer agreement on the iPhone.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.640]   Apple is now prohibiting developers
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.800]   from using advertising in their application
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.960]   that shares analytic data with an advertising service
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.800]   provider other than Apple.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.360]   In effect, saying you can use I-Ads,
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.160]   but you better not use AdMob.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:13.760]   Big shot against Google, you think?
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.040]   - I'd say it's a call to the FTC.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.040]   - Kind of shocking, and I think that's what Google--
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.080]   - Birds are already looking at it.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.640]   - I think it's Google wants, yeah.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.400]   What's the--
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.680]   - Let me play the devil's advocate.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.520]   Call to the FTC for a company,
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.080]   which is 2.2% of the overall mobile market.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.360]   I don't buy that.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.120]   I'm sorry, that's not what,
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.800]   you call the FTC when you're dealing with Microsoft, right?
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.160]   I'm sorry. - Are they Microsoft?
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.960]   - In Microsoft? - I'll threat Microsoft.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.000]   I mean, I agree, I agree.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.320]   - Chris, Microsoft. - No, no, no.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:50.320]   When I say back in the day when Microsoft was a monopoly,
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.640]   that's when you would need--
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.080]   - 'Cause they had 90% of the market or 95%, so.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.960]   - Right, so it's not like they're saying they own the--
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.440]   - You know, very soon.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.400]   - They might though.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.960]   Now, you could be proactive on this.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.920]   They're positioning themselves to own the mobile ad market.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.760]   - Yeah.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.360]   - I don't disagree with you.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.160]   And I'm telling the FTC to say the hell out of newspapers
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.120]   and the FCC likewise.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:12.960]   So I don't disagree with you.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.800]   What I'm saying is that I think it's a funny PR move
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.720]   at this stage in an early market to try.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.400]   Steve's just gone so wacky in controlled freakishness.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.460]   what is that is there a justification at all for this it besides the obvious
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.960]   business justification
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.400]   i mean usually apple has this nice consumer spin well it's for you it's in
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.420]   your interest what we said that was that was steve at d eight or detain or
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.500]   whatever hell is it d
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.940]   uh... was talking about how um...
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.620]   what flutter
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.960]   had sent date a back and this was a matter of principle as flutter was was
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.360]   because they were funny and find in out what place is worry apple free from
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.360]   flurry from
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.480]   uh... so i don't know if they if they so brett did has google gone to the or
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.000]   ad mob gone to the uh... f_t_c_
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.680]   well uh... mean we found out a couple of weeks ago uh... that the f_t_c_ was
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.600]   looking at apples behavior not only in the mobile phone market but uh... but the
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.000]   music market the digital music market
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.640]   you know i don't i don't know we sort of never know who's complained i mean my
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.120]   feeling is they all sort of complain about each other
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.160]   uh... but uh... you know yeah the f_t_c_ it seems to me is looking at it and
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.680]   you know almost point about market shares a good one but it's always about how
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.320]   you
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.680]   how you kind of define the market obviously
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.400]   the slicer you cut the pie
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.120]   more powerful apple scenes
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.680]   but here is the thing that's like it has a really even
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.480]   asked a big question like
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.080]   how much money do you really make from these mobile ads
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.560]   you will have to singly apple says they've already before i had launches have
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.520]   sixty million dollars with the buys
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.600]   yeah i think of you see it will believe it
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.080]   mean we have a mobile application the giga
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.080]   and mobile app and
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.680]   you know i bet you we
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.440]   the amount of money we've made from ad mob so far maybe less than fifty dollars
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.520]   and we've added out for about a month
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.560]   this you know this mobile advertising model
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.600]   i think people are not taking the time to do the fact that
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.800]   mobile is very different than than
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.640]   the web
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.120]   all right the web advertising model is entirely different
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.840]   it is actually pretty inefficient
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.040]   on the mobile
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.720]   advertising will have to be very efficient will have to be
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.120]   generating very high cpm in order for
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.880]   application providers and website developers
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.000]   to actually
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.280]   make decent money and i think even apple says you use our
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.520]   our application you know our ad system and you'll make more money
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.040]   well i'll see if i make more money are used there if not
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.280]   i might just say you know to help that we don't need to put any ads in this thing
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.520]   because after one month if i make fifty dollars just like wire with the
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.200]   experience so i don't think
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.360]   ad mob is very effective right now
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.200]   and you know i'm sure there are other people who will disagree with me
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.320]   but i don't buy that that you know
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.320]   you know that any of these guys have the right answer on mobile advertising
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.760]   i know it's the wrong
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.000]   curmudly
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.560]   you know that would look in view to take on things but i am taking that view
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.000]   well and jina doesn't just push developers
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.640]   to uh... and right i mean in in the long run it could be uh...
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.640]   a negative for apple be makes developers say well if i can't use any uh...
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.760]   platform i choose maybe i should choose another
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.440]   platform to write for
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.480]   yeah i mean i think developers who are focused like who have dollar signs in
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:39.600]   their eyes are probably gonna develop for the iphone anywhere anyway yeah so i
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.680]   don't i don't think it's that big deal i don't think that developers can feel
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.320]   some sort of allegiance to
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.400]   to add mob to google you know if you're gonna develop our phones you want to make
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.960]   a heck of a lot of money then i don't think it would be a
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.480]   uh... a big deal to you but i don't know because i have a lot of my phone
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.280]   developer and like i don't you know
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.000]   we're gonna move on and talk about in fact any trust uh... against google in
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.560]   general
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.960]   there is everybody's being investigated these days is just part of the way
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.000]   business works we also have a yeah because government doesn't have time to
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.480]   investigate the bank
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.400]   right they've been for free you
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.400]   pay no attention to the financial issue
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.800]   both guys are doing such a great job
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.000]   picking your pocket don't look at the b_p_ oil spill
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.560]   all of the companies
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.880]   let's go after people who actually make things with people want to buy people
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.960]   who are actually making u_s_ in comparative in the world market and that's
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.360]   not do that let's just let's just support all the idiots were

[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.580]   so uh... brand you wrote about this uh... couple weeks ago uh...
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:09.400]   what what is the status of the monopoly investigation
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.640]   against google
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.740]   i think you know it's it's it's quiet now you know the big the main course there
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:18.520]   for a while was ad mob and you know the f_t_c_ i think wanted to do something
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.880]   there if just uh...
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.960]   the challenge google uh... but also ultimately the market
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.880]   shifting market realities and
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.740]   an apple strength and its own i_d_
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:31.960]   you know system and acquisition of quattro wireless kind of forces hand
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.480]   it dropped it uh... you know my impression is the justice department you
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.900]   know is always you know taking every meeting a can try to learn more about
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.900]   unified search in the way in which google
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.380]   you know leverage is it's strength and search to go into other markets uh...
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.020]   you know
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:51.140]   probably now the focus of of attention is the will is the wifi uh... you know
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.300]   street view
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.700]   cook data collection i mean google just stepped in it a big time and we're
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.400]   gonna find out you know soon
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.400]   what kind of data it collected
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.740]   uh... says it was a rogue hacker employee
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.180]   that did it
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:08.440]   hopefully we'll find out more about that what they were up to but uh... you
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.560]   know i'm you know my sense uh... researching that was it washington
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.960]   stories that you have
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.040]   and i trust enforcers uh...
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.360]   like christine varney at the justice department
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.640]   and john lee bewitz at the f_t_c_ that
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.600]   you know i mean
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:20.600]   you know i mean
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.000]   you know right to oms point like you know google is is creating great products
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:25.920]   uh...
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.320]   you know creating jobs
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.280]   but what you know that i think that and i trust regulate
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:34.160]   regulators have seen again and again and all these markets is that
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:39.080]   uh... you know you gotta stop this behavior in its insipince insipiency or
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.760]   you can't do anything about it down the road i mean
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.920]   certainly that was
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.920]   you know that's that's been the lesson in a lot of these markets so i mean it
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.520]   looks at things like mobile advertising which is nothing
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.600]   you know but it's looking for evidence of anti-competitive behavior to try to
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.360]   stop it before you know any one company
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.720]   uh... you know get the stranglehold
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.640]   by behaving anti-competitively
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.920]   you know i don't know if we'll see any kind of microsoft style
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.920]   uh... investigation i mean the thing about google is one it's got the lesson
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.800]   of microsoft so you know nobody sending the kinds of emails that bill gates
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.720]   was sending in the nineties
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.800]   uh... and then it's just a different company with a different culture
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:16.920]   uh...
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.560]   but you know
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.520]   i mean i think
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.120]   i think regularly you know that and then there's just the
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.560]   the personal aspect which is like you know if you're an antitrust regulator in
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.200]   washington if you're not looking at google right now
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.440]   you know are you relevant i mean this is like the big fish and everybody wants
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.320]   to fry it so it's got it's got a lot of momentum and i think we'll we'll continue
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.400]   to hear about it for the next couple of years
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.120]   but is not attitude kind of scary a little bit i know i'm i'm a known google fanboy
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.040]   but
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.640]   but just this attitude that that says that when things get too big i thought
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.600]   about the europeans is where where's the law that tells me the definition of
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.480]   of of too big
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.560]   google didn't get there i don't think by doing anything evil
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.480]   newspapers messed up and google offers a better ad deal and and
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.960]   uh... all the mister was crappy next to google and so on they they just did
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.920]   things better and at some point
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.600]   is that dangerous for our economy to to you're always going to worry that all
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.400]   i can't be too successful
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.240]   right that's a lot of money at
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.560]   i mean i i think that i have my examples a great one the f_t_c_
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.720]   looked at the deal they spent okay they spent a lot of time looking at it and
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.640]   probably devoted a lot of resources
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.200]   but they approved it you know and maybe that was the right call and so
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.080]   uh... you know that that they're that they're checking you know that the
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.880]   corporate power i think has to be a good thing
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.520]   and then you know and then hopefully you know they'll continue to sort of
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.960]   behave and act with uh... you know all due consideration but you know it
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.600]   doesn't worry me that that this is a company that it obviously has a lot of
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.440]   power lot of market power
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.800]   control over the information that we see online and that someone's watching
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.240]   it can be a little bit worse
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.520]   i think there is one point to make in this which is
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.360]   if you really think about it
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.960]   uh...
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.200]   we as a society have come to a point
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.480]   where being successful
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.880]   you get penalized doesn't matter who you are whether you are a sports star
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.640]   your film actor you're a big company
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.800]   you are going to get turned on at some point or the other
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:17.280]   is that has become the favorite spectator sport of the time i think that is just
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.320]   universal
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.880]   and the second part of it
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.080]   if f_t_c_ and people in the
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.680]   congress and
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.160]   other government institutions are going to look into
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.640]   technology industry
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:31.840]   well they need to get educated about technology industry
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   they cannot be watched out
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.720]   by being
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.080]   marginally you know intelligent about these things
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.240]   if we've gone
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:43.120]   people to be smart about these things that makes more decisions
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.400]   to regulate the technology industry of what's over
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.760]   you need people who actually get it
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.360]   people who are smart about it people who are
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.880]   from the industry or actually are educated and things
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.680]   which are actually relevant to the industry
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.240]   i think this is where
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.680]   the big
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:06.400]   the big issues are not talked about is that we always are dealing with
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.240]   situations in a reactor manner whether it's the
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.440]   f_t_c_ investigation of ad mob or whatever
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.880]   in instead of taking three months or four months or five months
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.920]   that should have taken exactly two weeks if we have the right people in place
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.200]   right people in place for the men they would be aware of the
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.720]   industry dynamics
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.760]   and i think it should take five months
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.920]   it should cause taxpayers
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.120]   that much money
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.640]   i think this is where i think the system is
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:39.360]   not working properly in my opinion
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.920]   do uh... okay
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.520]   i think we can move on to you there goes brad
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.520]   that
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.880]   he took off so but i think he said it and uh...
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:53.160]   i think that's absolutely accurate and an investigation does not a uh...
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.520]   indictment make
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.760]   work or court
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.520]   a case make
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.760]   uh... let's see real quickly you're gonna ask
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.720]   are you buying i guess what's your buying everything i guess we should i guess
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.760]   we should talk about the i_f_o_ switch
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:11.040]   i might really you know i the real what happened was i i had the evo as you know
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.600]   for a while really love it and you still have your evo right because you got it
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.400]   i was just a review copy i just sent it back
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:21.280]   uh... and i was trying to say whether you own there she is she's fondling it
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.360]   i was trying to
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:26.880]   as trying to decide whether to get it and my experience was that the
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.160]   uh... battery life
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.040]   is probably just not good enough to keep i like the screen a lot but it's just it
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.840]   it i need to keep pumping it up
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.560]   i love my nexus one and i really that was the other problems i really like to to
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.040]   i want to have for i want froyo
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.600]   roio yep
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.760]   so g_s_m_ froyo in the battery life right over the three problems with the
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.960]   evo for sure
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:49.160]   by all i saw battery life with the nexus one but it's not as bad
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.580]   it's not as bad right right so i think i'll keep the nexus one but gosh
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.200]   started that screen
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.880]   on the i-phone jeff that's gotta make you kind of dorally
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.080]   yeah
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:02.120]   the rent the display looks amazing yeah that's that's to me the only thing i
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.600]   don't care about the front-facing camera we have that on the evo who you
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.920]   gonna call
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.760]   well i think that the front-facing camera's gonna make uh... chanrulat all the
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.280]   easier
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.800]   it's for sex let's face it and uh... and besides you have to
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.920]   you have to be in
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:18.040]   okay you could disavow all knowledge of uh... my
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.680]   you have to be in wifi which
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.600]   you know as yeah that's a that's a really problematic limitation right now
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.480]   my greatest disappointment i was counting on you know steve saying and now we're
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.480]   opening it up all carriers
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.160]   one more thing you can get on any carrier anything intelligent i haven't
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.680]   so the screen is your killer reason to drop and right and go back to i thought
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.920]   yeah because if if you want o_s_ for you got it on three g_s_ so uh... you know
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.400]   you got multitasking you've got uh...
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.840]   folders
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.960]   front-facing camera doesn't wow me
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.280]   the job i'm confused lio i'm here i thought i was going to you were going to
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.600]   go back to the i-phone
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.480]   i'm thinking about it because of the screen
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.600]   just the screen just the only thing that wows me enough
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.320]   i see you nodding your head uh... june
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:04.040]   now i can i mean i can understand the logic of the red display looks really
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:08.240]   beautiful i'm i have to buy it i have to buy it i mean that you have to weigh
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:12.240]   so i'll buy it review it the question is what will i carry in my pocket
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.600]   right i i i'm curious to know what that is
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.840]   yeah i don't know if you are you are uh...
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.440]   fickles can be with a comster devices is a blackberry man
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.000]   blackberry you know let's talk about that the blackberry a little bit and let's
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.080]   talk about the w_w_c_ d_c_ keynote because jobs you know
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:30.640]   the the blackberry is the device that's ahead of the i-phone right but jobs
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:34.560]   didn't really talk about rim right he talked about androids specifically
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.960]   even though microsoft's windows phone seven either
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.520]   he'd write so it was like he he but he mentioned and right by name twice even
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.000]   though androids not the iphones biggest
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.880]   like competition right rim is ahead of the iphone
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:50.160]   and then there's the iphone and then there's androids right
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.920]   i think androids only behind the iphone in browser usage
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.320]   uh... but i thought it was really interesting i i i found him kind of
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.040]   defensive and i thought it was interesting that he pointed out android
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.600]   it's so interesting because we of course
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:06.440]   you know google took a little a few hits thick uh... took a few hits for
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.880]   slamming apple and like that shows weakness and why you mentioned in
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.240]   competitor in your keynote
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.160]   steve does the same thing back
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.800]   yeah they're clearly in this
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.560]   but butting war right yeah there is that they are and and if you look at the
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:23.160]   numbers jobs has no reason to discuss androids
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.200]   i mean i think that he was like looking at a crowd of developers a crowd of early
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.640]   adopters a crowd of people who are that so he's talking to you talk about you
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.280]   and i think your evidence also they're not the phone business they're in the
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.480]   ad business
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.160]   well they showed that didn't they
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:39.000]   yes yes apple is still the device business but where the money is is
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   going to be the advertising and that's what i i i don't buy that for a minute i
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.360]   think there is
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.560]   uh... couple of things right the first of all
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.400]   i don't think anyone should discount
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.000]   rim at any point in time and i think
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.240]   apple is discounting them because
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:58.960]   if you really look at their self they keep going at least for near
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.680]   first year was uh... future
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:06.080]   rim will keep gaining market share or start selling
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.840]   uh... you know keep selling their devices because
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:12.840]   they are selling cheaper smartphones investor the work for secondly
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   i think the big issue with with apple and androids
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.800]   is
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:21.240]   two different ideology i think if you really think about it
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.280]   one ideology is is is
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:27.400]   apple's ideology which is a device event
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.160]   curated control
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.000]   experience which is proven to be money maker for developers
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.960]   and then there is the google experience which is a little bit
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.800]   you know more free form all over the place
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.440]   advertising centric
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.600]   revenue model
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.960]   so that the developers will soon enough make a choice
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.920]   which way they want to go because there will be more androids devices on the
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.000]   planet
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.760]   just a sheer number of people making handsets using androids
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.840]   will make sure that there is more androids
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.120]   on the planet
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:01.360]   but as a developer you will have to make a choice whether you want to go
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:04.560]   where the revenues are which is by selling apps and
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.360]   you know people are used to paying for certain things
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:10.960]   and then the ad business which is where google is focusing on
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.920]   and trying to make money that way
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.280]   i think we are going to see the shism
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.680]   or develop over the next couple of
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.560]   a year
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:23.000]   and i agree with you i think this whole apple versus androids
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.680]   is is a bit of a
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.880]   fight which shouldn't exist because
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.040]   the two of them are trying to leave Nokia
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.760]   for lunch essentially
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.600]   i mean if there is anybody they should be taking the exact
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.200]   it is that Nokia not each other because
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.400]   the two of them are too small to be taking
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.560]   they get each other in my opinion
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.600]   but i think
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:46.040]   no one in the case is such a bad shape i've said this to people there
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.720]   instead of the day to get somebody
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.120]   i think they should come out with android phones
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.640]   hahahaha
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:56.120]   well maybe maybe not i think you know i'm pretty happy with my blackberry i have
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.640]   to be very honest with you
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:00.840]   it doesn't run out of battery in middle of a conversation so
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.880]   and that's kind of an issue you know and jos what's a polsky from engadget said
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:06.840]   an interesting thing on twitter this week are you on which network are you on
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.240]   om are you on 18-10 with your blackberry
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:14.680]   no i use steam mobile and and they have this thing called uma which basically
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.960]   you know if you're on wifi anywhere on the planet it seems like you're making
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:20.520]   local phone call yeah boy i've had that quality is
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.840]   terrible though on that you you're okay with that
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.360]   yeah works for me like i've been using it for almost a year now okay
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:31.320]   yeah i i had the uma for a while too i i would love to own a
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.520]   an iphone like on a permanent basis
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:39.160]   but you know there is one a letter word i mean three letter word
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:43.800]   with which starts with an a which completely drives me insane so
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:47.160]   three letter word this is like crossword puzzles a three letter
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.200]   oh damn
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:54.040]   yeah i i i didn't know if you saw my post about a year and a half ago
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.880]   i was the first one to break up with the iphone because of 18 yeah well you were
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.400]   probably right at but but joshua was saying that this is what i'm curious
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.440]   about is do you get dropped calls on anything but the iphone maybe it's the
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:07.640]   iphone in which case maybe this new design which puts the antenna
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:13.400]   now my on my for g my 3g atnt card right before i came on the air
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.840]   it looked good after even the air it was dropping like crazy oh but that but
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.120]   you're driving you were driving that's what it's meant for
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:23.720]   being not why you're driving 60 miles an hour sure
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.600]   can be able to work for me and my assistant is selling train driving at
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.040]   120 miles an hour really this is really fun
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.760]   the funny part of this whole conversation is that
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:39.800]   at at data network is the one which is choke right because of the iphone
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:44.120]   which is which is like a data check voice channel should be dropping calls so
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:47.640]   you know there's clearly some issues there right like so they will be asked
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:53.160]   a question if if you created a data only network no
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:57.320]   voice would it be more efficient
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:03.160]   no it basically it all depends on two things
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:08.200]   Jeff to have a really strong data network which
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:13.880]   AT&T can support the i-fo-be can support millions of iphone users you need to
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:17.320]   have a lot of spectrum you need to have a lot of
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:21.000]   backhaul bandwidth and you need to have a lot of radios in a lot of places
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.280]   where power radio in a lot of places in a city
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:28.680]   you cannot just expect to have a great network which is
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:32.200]   not fully architected for for an iphone user
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.320]   right like essentially i got my masking the next question so if you're going to
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:40.840]   build a network now if you're if you're a sprint building this network
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.280]   would maybe better off building a pure data network and going ahead and
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:49.720]   declaring defeat and making voice wipe but that's exactly what lte is supposed
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:53.000]   to do and that's exactly what ymax is supposed to do
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.320]   uh interest yeah if you know if you really look at the ymax network we have
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:00.440]   right now they are a little slow but they are
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:05.800]   built for an ip world and same with lte so when that happens
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:10.360]   then it will become the question of how the carriers want to charge you
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:15.000]   i think that's the reason why they all went from flat rate to
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:20.440]   to these smaller tiers because as lte comes out it would become
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:26.280]   less uh profitable for them to offer you flat rate data so they will offer you
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:30.920]   data but you with the more calls you make the more video calls you make
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:35.000]   a more voice calls you make you will still have to pay for them so this will be
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.200]   like the area of continuing the phone companies
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.560]   for a way for them to keep making money and i think that's the
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:45.160]   which is fine right like if you really think about it that's the only way
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.600]   they can you know put money into the network it's just getting some kind of
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:52.200]   data that means so you will see that like that'd be fun i mean
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:55.800]   but it's still a little bit weighs off another two years before we see some
[00:59:55.800 --> 01:00:02.040]   that stuff happen but what phones do you guys use i do really well we're all
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.040]   nexus one users because we really strong armed jeff to give up his iphone and
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:09.560]   now he's going to go out when i switch back to the iphone or maybe cry i don't
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:14.040]   know jeff you have an iphone i both but i'm using the nexus one except
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:18.120]   when i was in europe uh what i was in south africa wasn't worth it to get
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.400]   a uh sim down there however i pay a hundred dollars a month to use
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:27.080]   at and t outside the u.s so i could have a hundred
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.240]   megs and be safe right hit south africa sorry not involved
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.280]   ten dollars a meg oh yeah there's some asian nations too
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.040]   where that uh international data plan doesn't work
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:43.400]   now it's a little frustrating um what about gina what phone do you use
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:48.520]   on a daily day i use the nexus one um which i bought myself i got an
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.720]   evo at google i.o um but i am trying not to get too hooked on it because
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.760]   i'm gonna have an early termination fee with my uh with my t-mobile contract
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.800]   because i have a t-mobile contract you get 30 days of use of the evo so you have
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.240]   a decision to make in a right do i switch to sprint or not which i
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.240]   probably won't if forg was here in san diego and the evo was to was android
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.680]   2.2 i would switch but but not not quite yet and it might be
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.960]   android 2.2 by then we don't know i mean they they keep making sounds like
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.200]   they're gonna do this i think actually you do have uh 4g in
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.360]   san diego gina because quarkam has their headquarters
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.800]   that's true quarkam is here next to quarkam it works great
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.280]   yeah like if you're in like two miles radius from their office
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.040]   you can actually get 4g you can pick it up that's not funny there's
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.760]   there's some places in silicon valley too where 4g works
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.440]   4g works perfectly yeah google campers exactly
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:44.920]   yes i'm gonna park my rv down there and i'm gonna just hook up all my computers
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.080]   it's gonna be my internet access that's it i'm gonna do
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:52.200]   to it from the rv by quarkam next time i'm sure they will find a way to get you
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.440]   the bandwidth first this world is gonna change though
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.720]   next year with lte uh and wider uh sprint clear wire
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:05.000]   everything changes quite if it doesn't it uh this but but maybe not if we're
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.320]   only getting two gigabytes a month and you have to pay for more bandwidth
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.080]   that's all yeah that's why it sure remains that we're just
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:16.360]   gonna be nervous we're yeah it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna put a
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.960]   stranglehold on use which is gonna put a stranglehold on development
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.920]   which is gonna put a stranglehold on the business model of normal
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.520]   justice is right or take off well that's exactly what we've been writing
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.040]   about i hope people do pay attention to this whole
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.360]   issue more seriously i think this is a really really serious issue for our
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:38.280]   industry this whole bandwidth category i agree i agree
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.680]   i mean i kind of i have to say i'm a little sympathetic because the
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.720]   infrastructure for mobile data is very different than the infrastructure for
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.640]   your internet service provider for your you know your your house and a
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.600]   business that's why i'm asking about voice versus data
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.440]   that's interesting yeah they're trying to protect the old models
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.400]   and if you disrupt it entirely the problem is it takes too much capital
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.960]   to disrupt this industry but if you did if if whites white spaces really
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:06.760]   existed with with wi-fi on steroids you build it around data purely
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.960]   and i wonder whether the whole voice structure and the whole effort to
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.960]   maintain that business model
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.960]   causes problems you know i'd be a lot more willing to pay more for data every
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.880]   month if i didn't have to pay for the voice
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:21.000]   and there's no reason i shouldn't be able to do that
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   and by the way if you're paying and through the nose for data
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   how long before you put ad blockers on all these i ads and ad mobs and all
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.960]   that stuff because that's just using up more data
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.640]   that's true too you know i mean this is kind of against their business model in
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.640]   some ways uh according to a mashable mobile there's
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:44.120]   an hack that allows 720p video recording on the nexus one
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.160]   so maybe maybe jina and i don't have to move
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:52.200]   oh oh oh oh i haven't tried this i have to try it
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.040]   you've rooted your uh your handset i'm sure right
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.880]   i i have rooted past handsets i decided to try and
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.080]   be go non-root with the nexus one because that's how you know most normal
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:06.920]   people you have to use it you have to use a cyanogen rom
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.440]   to uh to do this and for froyo is not supported so i don't know if it's
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.480]   really a real but it's interesting which but the point is that there's a lot of
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.240]   hardware that that is not currently taken advantage of
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:21.320]   by the operating system right do i apologize i've got a i've got a dash
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.960]   chef jakes thank you for tonight um so but i'm glad i could make it on even
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.200]   from a moving car we are thrilled to have you as
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:32.120]   always jeff jarvis the blogger to buzz machine dot com the author of what
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.720]   would google do professor of journalism at coz you and jina and oh
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.360]   well pleasure to see you my friend great to have you jeff take care
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.760]   and we already got your numbers so goodbye thank you
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.560]   oh if you want to take off too we're just going to wrap this thing up so uh
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.560]   go ahead just everybody else is left i know where they're dropping like flies
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:54.200]   it's just gonna be me and jina i don't want to be rude i just want to make
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.880]   sure i do my job and then go my secret plan is coming true i just
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:03.160]   go ahead leave no no jina it's time for your tip of the week
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.400]   tip of the week this is this is a good one i like this one uh new gmail labs
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.960]   feature uh google maps previews so if you go into your gmail lab settings and
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.760]   you enable this it's just called google maps previews
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.640]   someone emails you uh an address it embeds a google map right inside the
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:23.240]   message uh you can expand it you can open it in new window
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.440]   super super handy gmail is really really getting really good at this now like
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.640]   the the embedding content you know someone sends you a youtube video you
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.600]   you can see that you can you know get the embed with the play button
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.720]   flicker pictures it does the same thing which is nice because they're you know
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.440]   yahoo's our competitor so now we have maps and this is this
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.040]   pretty pretty sweet and actually i think this works in buzz as well
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.160]   well i haven't tried it leo you probably know if you buzz an address i think
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.480]   you get automatically a google map uh embedded so i have to turn it on in the
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.600]   in the uh in the lab setting for gmail to get that in the
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:57.160]   game but okay so you can turn it on and then scroll down and uh hit the save
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:02.280]   changes button and then if you search for uh a map mail or an email if you get
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.880]   an email with an address in it it'll just automatically embed a map so you know
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.280]   it's just one of these little things that you're gonna turn on and forget about
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.440]   it and then you're gonna get an email with an address and you're in
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.160]   instead of having a flip to a new tab and look it up a google maps it'll be
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.880]   right there for you isn't that nice that's awesome i love gmail labs
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:22.280]   they i do too you know and it's good to thank you for letting us know because
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.200]   they change they add stuff all the time they do i'm stealing one that really
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.320]   by all rights should have been yours and not only am i stealing it from you but
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:33.560]   i'm stealing it from from giga ohm Matthew Ingram writing yesterday on
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:37.560]   giga ohm google tries to get some buzz for wave with
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:44.680]   wave this did you know about this jina yes i did it's a bookmarklet how cool so
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:49.400]   if if you go to the google a blog and i'm just gonna
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:55.240]   click the link here you can create a new wave from any web page
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.720]   which is very cool and there's a way of this api so you can also put a wave
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:04.760]   this button on your web page so now that everybody is
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.360]   is and actually it's just an a it's actually pretty easy it's a uh
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.920]   you just got it's just add this link and anything could be a wave so if
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.880]   now that everybody can use wave because the invitations are open
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.880]   maybe we'll see more waves you see you see more interest in wave now i mean
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.800]   google you wrote them in google jina you wrote the book i'm calling her
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:28.120]   google from now on i am saying more interest our sales went up which was
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.880]   nice there and uh definitely but still getting that feeling that you really
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.960]   had to kind of bring somebody in and show them and then i like this is cool
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.320]   yeah uh so wave still kind of has that little bit of a learning curve problem
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.680]   but the people who um i have used it with really like it and we did see a
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.880]   little spike in sales after after they opened it up which i was
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.000]   pleased about and thank you to anyone who's using wave at all home and
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.520]   in your business sir yeah i'm no i'm not breast on my team does
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:58.200]   they do yeah i like i like twitter so unfortunately i just spend most of my
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:02.280]   time on twitter isn't it funny twitter is now the old fart thing
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:09.240]   oh you're so old you use twitter oh man you're old man i'm not
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:17.560]   oh i use buzz it's modern yeah if you're just a diverse psychology only
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.160]   only the old people use the latest technology right like facebook
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:28.680]   like that no but i have one tip for you guys uh both you and uh jina love it
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:34.760]   so you like android so soon samsung is going to introduce a new phone called
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.560]   samsung galaxy i can't wait to see it have you seen you will be so pleasant it's
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:45.000]   surprised and it will be like your nexus one will look like a you go
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.840]   compared to that well it's a huge screen it's an amoled screen right
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:53.000]   beautiful i just saw it like in europe um before coming
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.400]   it is unbelievably and it doesn't look like an android phone it is
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.200]   as close to an iphone has if any android device
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.200]   has come it's pretty amazing and i think you guys want to buy that whenever you
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.960]   have an opportunity the current rumors are that t-mobile will have it in july i
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:14.360]   hope that's the case i hope so see now we got a tough decision
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:18.840]   every phone every month there's a new phone uh it's tough being an android user
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:23.400]   it's really it's exactly no point buying shoes now despite the phone
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.360]   it's a new phone every three months whether you want one or not
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:31.320]   what do you mean every three months it should be every 15 days
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:34.760]   it really feels like every six weeks i feel like someone needs to chart this
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.680]   on a timeline it's ridiculous it's true i'll do it for you jina but
