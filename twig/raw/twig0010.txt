[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.000]   Proctober 3, 2009.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.320]   Everything's shiny, Captain.

[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.360]   We couldn't do Twig without it.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.800]   This is Twig.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.280]   This week in Google.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.720]   And this week in Wave, joining us right now,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.800]   Jeff Jarvis from New York City and BuzzMachine.com.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.800]   I'm waving.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.760]   He's waving.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.440]   He's waving.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.560]   And we just sent a microphone out to you, Jeff,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.880]   so your audio will sound superb.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.440]   Next we got--
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.680]   And I get fly-- and Monday is file stay here at Jarvis House.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.160]   Oh, wow.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.600]   I don't like some.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.120]   I don't like to.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.120]   I don't like to.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.120]   I don't like to.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.160]   That's going to be fun.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.680]   Nice.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.120]   Also here, that's Gina Trapani.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.760]   You hear her lovely voice and her two bicycles now.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.400]   I'm back online.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.560]   The bicycles are back online.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.760]   The bicycles are back.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.160]   And a familiar British voice, Kevin Marks,
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.200]   is here from British Telecom, VP of the internet
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.160]   at British Telecom.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.160]   And Kevin, very involved in Wave because not only
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.400]   is he a former Googler, but he also
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.200]   is responsible for working with the Ribbit Wave extension.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.320]   That's a very cool talk about that.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.720]   So Wave invitations went out.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.440]   And boy, this has been the hottest invite since Gmail.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.240]   People just begging to get their invites.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.080]   Now, Jeff, you're new to it.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.560]   I am.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.720]   I'm relatively new to it.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.840]   I've only had it for five days.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.200]   Gina and Kevin, I presume you've
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.040]   been using it since the Google I/O.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.920]   Yes, it's May.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.640]   May is for something.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.640]   So let me, I guess, ask first your impression, Jeff,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.280]   since you're the most-- the least senior, the newest user.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.200]   Yeah, I needed Gina less than you are and how you use it.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.280]   That's the problem.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.600]   So far, to me, it looks like chat,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.800]   because I haven't used it up until I
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.440]   haven't put in enough of the little wavelets and stuff.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.880]   I was gov smacked this week, but Scoble went on attacking it.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.480]   And I tweeted it.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.400]   What did he say?
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.160]   He just said it was just a time waster and too much
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.400]   communication and this and that.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.520]   And I tweeted back that I said, that's
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.080]   like looking at the first browser and saying, oh, it's gray
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.640]   and ugly, it'll never go anywhere.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.160]   It's early.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.680]   It's just the beginning of functionality.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.240]   And I think we've got to keep open to what
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.560]   the possibilities are here.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.480]   I know people in news are buzzing about,
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.880]   as I have been at the beginning, about what it can do there.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.400]   And I'm sure a lot of other areas.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.360]   We see that SAP and Salesforce.com are writing apps for it.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.080]   You've got Kevin Marks there writing apps for it.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.360]   I think that that's--
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.800]   I wonder whether wave will be a little like RSS,
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.480]   that it will be Intel inside, wave inside.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.040]   You may not know you're using it sometimes.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.400]   We're actually getting a lesson in our wave right now
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.080]   from Kevin Marks on how to get our avatars visible.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.800]   See, my avatar is visible to me, but apparently I haven't
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.880]   shared it publicly.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.080]   And as a result, I don't see yours, Jeff.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.680]   So what do I click?
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.000]   Well, I just got to put one up.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.440]   Oh, it's--
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.520]   You click on yourself in the bottom left corner,
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.480]   then you do edit profile.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.040]   OK, I'm not going to do that in public.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   I have phone numbers in there.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   That's changed.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.360]   Edit profile.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.960]   No, I'm wrong.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.960]   They've changed the UI.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   What happens?
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.920]   No, no, no.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.080]   It says your profile photo is not visible to everyone.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.960]   It's currently only visible to people with whom you can chat.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.680]   OK.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.160]   So that means--
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.080]   Then you change that profile.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.400]   I have to just change that.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.480]   Yes, make my photo visible to everyone.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.400]   And you did that in your Google profile.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.280]   Oh, it's in the profile now.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.800]   They moved it.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.480]   OK.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.080]   So that-- it used to be in the Gmail pref.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.840]   So it's interesting.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.800]   It's the end of profile.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.600]   That's good.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.400]   Well, and there's one thing I've noticed
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.920]   is when I hit the contacts button,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.320]   it goes to my Google contacts.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.440]   And it doesn't seem to be in any way attached to Wave.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.360]   Well, that's the same database underneath.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.880]   It's just that the Wave 1 is filtering it for is on Wave 2,
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.480]   whereas the actual contact management is still
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.680]   in the same general Google database with the contacts.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.840]   And this is another thing I puzzle about.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.600]   It seems that anybody can become my contact
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.840]   without any permission on my part.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.760]   Oh.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.760]   Yeah, that needs to change.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.760]   Pretty much.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.200]   Yeah, that definitely needs to be.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   That needs to change.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.280]   There need to be permissions.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.080]   And I haven't heard about it, but I
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.480]   would be surprised if that wasn't on the list of things
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.440]   to do, which is long.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.640]   There's a long to do list.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.960]   Imagine my surprise I sign up for the--
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.440]   no, we should mention this.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.880]   Until Thursday, everybody was using the Wave sandbox.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.640]   The sandbox went down.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.120]   And then when it came back up, it said, now you have to migrate.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.840]   And now we're officially at wave.google.com.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.360]   Right.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.640]   The Wave sandbox is still there for the developers.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.600]   So Gina and I now have two accounts, which
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.880]   makes it even more confusing.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   Yep.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.680]   So what did you-- where?
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.520]   Where did you wave?
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.120]   Which one?
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.000]   I don't know if that's going to be the end.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.560]   So there is no federation.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.880]   And this one, the Wave that we're in right now--
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.520]   so is it a different server, Kevin?
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.720]   What is going on here?
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.220]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.440]   I think this is a different server.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.760]   So the original one was running under wave sandbox.com
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.520]   domain.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.040]   So it was like running Gmail on your own domain,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.480]   on a private domain.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.680]   And this one, the new Wave is on Google.com.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.920]   So that's like being Gmail, rather than apps for your domain.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.800]   OK.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.000]   Yeah, that's very good.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.160]   Now one of the things we've been saying is, oh, Wave
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.960]   will be a very different experience when there are lots
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.720]   of people we know in there.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.800]   And that's true.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.040]   Maybe not a better experience yet.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.720]   It's certainly a chaotic experience.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.520]   It definitely is.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.440]   You want to think part of the problem?
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.280]   Go ahead, Gina.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.640]   No, no.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.240]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.160]   Go ahead.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.440]   I think part of the problem is it is too much the sandbox.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.320]   I've got to have something real to do with it
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.880]   to see how it works.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.600]   Now it's kind of like the beginnings of the first time
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.120]   you get a phone and you call somebody and say, hey, I am a phone.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.320]   It's like Steve Martin, I'm a jerk.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.960]   The Wave is in.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.800]   The Wave is in.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.880]   And there's nothing to do with it.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.720]   When I actually start doing something with someone
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.240]   with a purpose, then I think I'll
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.480]   have a far better sense of it.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.360]   I gave a talk about Wave here in San Diego at a local tech
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.880]   event.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.200]   And I did all my show notes.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.440]   This is on the dev preview.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.520]   I did all my-- excuse me-- the outline for my talk in Wave.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.680]   And I had someone--
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.200]   Really?
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.320]   --the event organizer.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.520]   I had him get into the Wave while I was talking
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.760]   and sort of note down questions and comments.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.960]   Oh, how cool.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.000]   And that was really, really, really useful.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.320]   So you really do have to-- because the first experience
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.920]   is a very I am like experience.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.200]   This is how it is with all of my friends that are like, hey,
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.720]   I'm here.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.240]   You're here.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.920]   Let's Wave.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.720]   It looks very much like an I am.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.920]   But it's using it as a document collaboration tool.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.680]   That's when it gets useful.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.720]   Right.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.560]   And when we can use it to publish something publicly that
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.680]   doesn't open people into the Wave,
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.760]   I think that's going to be really powerful.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.880]   It would be collaborating on something
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.600]   and make something together.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.080]   Yep.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.160]   So that's what I've been saying about it for a while,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.640]   which is a lot of people have been saying, oh, it's
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.720]   like Twitter, it's like Facebook.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.720]   It isn't like actually either of those.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.120]   It's really a document collaboration tool
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.760]   that happens to update very quickly.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.120]   So it's much closer to Google Docs
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.880]   or to Etherpad than it is to Twitter or Facebook.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.160]   Because the model is completely different.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.240]   It is document centric.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.560]   It just doesn't quite seem to be because of the UI they've
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.640]   put on it.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.040]   If we don't--
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.320]   Yeah, I'm not used to yet is the live nature of it,
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.200]   rather than-- I'm so used to the bio-rhythm of chatter
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.960]   or for that matter, even Twitter, where you wait
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.120]   for completed messages.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.520]   Oh, you don't wait here.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.020]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.000]   It's very weird.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.640]   Everybody's typing at the same time.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.000]   And it's a very strange experience.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.800]   But although they're good tools for reviewing what's
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.920]   been added, it gets highlighted in yellow.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.400]   You could press the space bar to jump through changes.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.840]   So it is possible to review.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.400]   There's even, of course, that playback thing
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.080]   that they demonstrated on that hour-long video.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.640]   I mean, this is one of Scoble's one biggest criticisms of it,
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.720]   that it's so distracting because you're watching people's
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.720]   cursors go by.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.840]   But they haven't released draft mode yet, right?
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.560]   So there's a little check box that's great out right now
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.400]   because they haven't built in the functionality yet.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.560]   Where you can either check that.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.080]   Or you can type without anybody seeing you, not naked.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.040]   That will be nice.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.760]   That will be nice.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.240]   That will be nice.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.240]   I think that'll be really nice.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.680]   And I think that should be on by default.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.760]   But I don't know if that's--
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.080]   I think that's really funny, though.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.920]   That's the reason I had to get rid of Scoble on Twitter
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.360]   because he was very distracting.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.880]   It is pretty funny.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.080]   Imagine if Scoble's in a wave.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.880]   Now, he's listening to the show by now, by the way.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.520]   He says, I'd love to get him on.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.360]   And he says, I can't get on.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.920]   I haven't had a shower yet.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.480]   But I think one of the criticisms
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.280]   was that he might have seen it more as a social media device.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.160]   It's not Twitter.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.200]   It's not "Friend Feed."
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.040]   It's not social media.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   It's a collaborative tool.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.320]   I think I have to think about it more like Wikipedia than email.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.040]   But the problem with that is that most people don't edit
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.880]   Wikipedia, so that metaphor wouldn't speak to the mainstream.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.840]   But I think that the serious geeks that have edited
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.960]   Wikipedia pages before or just pawed through the revisions
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.680]   of a page and watched it change over time,
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.480]   there was that fantastic screencast that I think
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.680]   John Udell did of the history of the Oomle out in Rockstar--
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.200]   in like Rock Band names.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.080]   And it was fantastic.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.360]   It's a Wikipedia page.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:36.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.120]   It's a Wikipedia page.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.560]   And he did a screencast of the page
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.080]   that as it grew over time, which is exactly what
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.560]   Wave Playback is.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.320]   And so that's what you have to think about it.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.480]   And then there's the talk page on Wikipedia pages
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.760]   where people can make comments.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.000]   I mean, this is really for nerds that know what Wikipedia
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.960]   really can do.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.680]   I think that's how we have to think about Wave,
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.560]   rather than the email metaphor.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.000]   - Scobble does make a good point.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.040]   This was pitched as a replacement for email.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.600]   And I think that's part of the confusion.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   I don't think this is--
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.440]   - That's wrong, yeah.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.960]   - This is not a replacement for email.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.480]   - No.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.440]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.800]   I think that's the problem is it puts something
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.400]   in your mind's eye of what it was.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.840]   It's like the iPhone should have come out first,
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.320]   I think, without the phone.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.480]   So you saw it as a computer and then add the phone to it.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.320]   - Right.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.880]   - It sets expectations.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.760]   And Gina, I think you're absolutely right about this,
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.320]   that I keep looking at it as the future of the document online.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.520]   And that's not a page anymore.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.720]   It's a constantly updated thing.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.040]   I've been yammering on on this show about a nurse
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.520]   and I are talking about hyper personal news streams.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.560]   And Eric Schmidt gave two interviews this week,
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.120]   one a really good interview to Danny Sullivan about news.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.520]   And he too was going on about this notion
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.120]   of the constantly updated, highly personal stream.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.680]   So I think if you look at wave as a water metaphor,
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.080]   as a stream of stuff that you can come into any time
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.040]   and see but it is constantly updated,
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.880]   that's a whole different view of what the email.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.960]   - Yeah, but that might replace email as a collaborative tool.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   In other words, email probably wasn't a very good choice
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   for that.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.920]   I like your analogy, Gina.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.000]   It's real time Wikipedia, it's kind of what it is.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.600]   - Yes, it's much closer to a wiki.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.680]   Well, more like an intranet wiki
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.800]   because each wave has a set of people who can modify it.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.600]   So it's much more like an intranet wiki.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.880]   I think, I mean, when Lars talks about reinventing email,
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.120]   I think he meant reinventing a lot of the practices
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.200]   that we use email for collaborating about documents
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.080]   and seeing how frustrating that is.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.160]   So if you think about email within a large corporation,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.960]   which is probably his experience now is in Google,
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.840]   you spend a lot of time back and forth
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.480]   and then sending links to documents and things.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:45.480]   So I think his goal there was to replace those practices.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.200]   But the core of it, if you go deep down to the protocol,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.440]   the protocol, it's about simultaneously editing a document
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.680]   and having those edits coalesce into one thing that you can see.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.960]   And there's a plugin that somebody did
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.000]   that lets you edit media wiki using the wave interface.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.240]   And that's one of the other plugins.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.160]   And that's an interesting way to look at it.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.160]   But the tricky thing is that Wikipedia has this surface thing,
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.480]   which is the current state of the document,
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.280]   and then hidden away underneath it is the argument.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.840]   And with Wave, they're in the same place.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.920]   So that makes it a little bit harder
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.160]   because you don't have the two faces of the document.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.280]   And at the moment, because it's new,
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.280]   most people are using it to talk back and forth
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.760]   rather than trying to edit something.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.680]   So what you see is this sort of badly threaded chat
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.720]   rather than we're collaborating on creating something together.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.000]   So I suspect that will change as people get more used to it
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.560]   and stop using it, and you stop playing with a new feature.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.840]   But partly because a lot of people have said this is,
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.920]   it's like I am in chat in the same thing.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.240]   I am in email in the same app.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.400]   People are getting a bit sort of drawn towards that side
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.000]   and not seeing the document inside of it.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.840]   - Well, isn't it true really that if anything's going to be
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.800]   truly innovative, it's not going to fit into any pigeonhole,
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   and it's going to be at first bewildering to its users.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   Otherwise, it's just a rehash.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.000]   And I think of Twitter, when you first saw Twitter,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.440]   it didn't make any sense at all.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.080]   And it's taken a while for us to absorb it.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.800]   This is even more innovative.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.960]   So I think it's kind of a measure of how novel it is
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.200]   that it's not immediately obvious.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.440]   - That was something Laura Fitt said at the 140 Conference
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.720]   was that the users recreated Twitter
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.400]   into something interesting
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.000]   that extended Jack's original vision.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.280]   I think that's very, very true then.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.040]   I suspect that would be true of Wave as well.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.440]   - Yes.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.040]   - But as you said, there are places where Wave is like email.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.280]   In that, anyone who has your Wave address
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.800]   can add you to things and send you stuff
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.120]   and put them in your inbox.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.440]   So it hasn't picked up the sort of white list based model
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.840]   of who can talk to me that we have on Twitter
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.600]   and Facebook and the other social networks.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.120]   It still has the, if you have my address token,
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.720]   then you can put stuff at the top of my inbox.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.800]   So that's the piece that's tricky.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.240]   - Well, the other thing that is maybe disappointing to me
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.360]   is I was hoping we could use it
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.560]   in a kind of a broadcast form, have a massive Wave.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.200]   And I don't think that that's gonna work at all.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.560]   That's not something you could do with this at all.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.400]   - Well, that's the mistake the LA Times made
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.720]   with its famous Wiki-torial.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.160]   If you remember back in the day, they thought,
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.000]   "Well, be cool."
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.360]   They put up a Wiki of a--
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.200]   - Right, a mistake.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.360]   - It was about Iraq and no one was gonna collaborate.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.280]   And the key to Wikis are that they must be collaborative.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.680]   It's not a place to discuss really or to argue.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.360]   And I think that's where the vision for Wave comes in
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.200]   that it's right, it's real time collaboration,
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.840]   but you've gotta be trying to do something together.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.960]   - Well, there must be a shared goal.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.920]   'Cause the Wiki converges on the shared goal.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.600]   So Wiki-pede works 'cause you're trying to build
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.080]   an encyclopedia and you got NPOV to guide you.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.400]   So people would delete stuff.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.120]   But the trouble with Wiki is if there's dissension,
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.320]   it ends up deleted 'cause you get into edit wars.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.720]   And it then moves into the comment thing hidden
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.840]   behind the scenes.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.920]   And so, yeah, you're right, it doesn't work for something
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.640]   where you're actually trying to have a back and forth debate.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.560]   And I think that may be tricky with Wave
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.800]   if you try and use it in that mode
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.520]   in terms of getting consensus, which means deleting.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.720]   And Adina Levin read a great post on this.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.840]   She actually read it back in July,
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.840]   but she spot on about the missing modality here,
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.960]   which is what happens when you're having conversations
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.840]   in email and so on.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.680]   Is that someone sums up the discussion so far
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.320]   and said, "This is where we are."
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.800]   And I suppose the idea of Wave is you delete all the stuff
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.320]   that wasn't true anymore and cut us that down.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.800]   But I suspect it's gonna take a while for us
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.880]   to get that social practice right
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.200]   because people will feel like you're throwing away
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.280]   their comments.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.000]   - Well, it's gonna have to be in kind of consensual groups
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.160]   that these waves are formed.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.360]   They're not gonna, they can't be public.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.240]   They have to be joint ventures
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.440]   that we all have investment in.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.200]   - And there has to be a gardener, right?
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.640]   - As there is with Wikipedia.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   I mean, there's a very strong watchful community
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.840]   always watching.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.120]   When I published that wave on my blog,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.440]   I was like, okay, I looked out for the first few hours
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.480]   and checked the comments, but eventually it's gonna fall
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.440]   up my front page and I'm not gonna look at it again
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.040]   and it could get totally vandalized and I wouldn't know
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:03.880]   'cause I just don't have,
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.120]   I'm not gonna have the time to constantly garden every wave
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.600]   that I make public.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.040]   So it'd be interesting to see what happens
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.880]   with the permission stuff.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.760]   Like I agree with Kevin that it's similar to email.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.120]   The way I work right now is just similar to email.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.440]   Anybody can wave at you.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.920]   I'm not so crazy about that system.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.800]   As I said, I mean, with G-Talk, I can say, you know,
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.400]   only people or at least with AIM,
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.480]   with instant messenger clients
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.440]   and I always set my settings like this.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.720]   Only the people who are on my list,
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.880]   all my contacts lists can actually chat me
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.560]   'cause I don't want the whole world to be able to chat me.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.240]   So I wonder if Wave's gonna take that on.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.080]   I hope so.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.960]   I think permissions are an important part of it.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.200]   - There's an interesting wave I've been looking at
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.400]   in my wave.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.040]   Somebody has asked, would you like to see your Google email
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.840]   in a private Google wave?
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.680]   And they've got a poll and a vast majority of users
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.280]   say yes to that.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.760]   That's an interesting use of it.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.600]   - That's weird.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.760]   I'm not sure that would work.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.600]   (laughing)
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.880]   - It's kind of, but see, remember Kevin,
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.280]   we don't know how it's gonna work.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.280]   We don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.800]   The users are gonna define that, right?
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.360]   - But the Gmail does a fairly good job
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.640]   of taking individual messages
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.880]   and turning them back into a conversational thread.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.040]   That's what keeps us using it
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.440]   in that it throws away all the repeated stuff
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.040]   and just shows you the new stuff.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.520]   So when someone's quoting someone else
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.360]   and there's craft in it, it chops that out
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.800]   and shows that, it just shows that.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.760]   And it collapses the ones you've already seen.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.080]   So it's doing a fairly good job
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.080]   of taking a message oriented protocol
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.200]   and turning it into a sort of time order coalesce thread.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.120]   Whereas Wave is built the other way around.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.720]   Wave is built as a document with a series of edits
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.120]   and it's presenting itself as a series of messages.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.440]   And so, sorry, when you bridge it to something else,
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.600]   it doesn't work very well.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.600]   So that it was, when you use the Twitter bot,
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.080]   it shows you a bunch of tweets and you send something back,
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.360]   but you don't see any responses to that
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.360]   'cause it's fed out to something else
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.720]   and it's not sitting there polling Twitter
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.680]   for app replies and things and coalesce in the back in.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.320]   And if it did, it's very hard to bridge something
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.080]   that there is one true version of,
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.600]   which there is in a Wave,
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.240]   even though it's slightly delayed.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.440]   The delayed edits come in from different times
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.560]   and then create the one true version
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.360]   with something where there is many parallel things
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.480]   going on at once,
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.800]   which is what the state of Twitter is
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.360]   and other social networks.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.480]   Everyone sees something different
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.680]   because we're all seeing a different subset
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.920]   of the conversation.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.760]   And that isn't the sort of structural model of Wave.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.400]   There's a couple of bits that let you do
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.840]   private conversations within a Wave,
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.600]   but it's not very clear how that works so far.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.040]   - So let me understand something here.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.080]   Is, if you look at friend and feed's relationship
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.160]   with Twitter and so on and so forth,
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.920]   is Wave gonna feed out or is Wave gonna aggregate
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.080]   from elsewhere or is it gonna be completely separate
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:42.920]   from the world?
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.920]   - How to say, it's a difficult bridge to do,
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.920]   that's the thing.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.840]   Because friend, feed and Facebook and Twitter
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.800]   all have the same conceptual model of
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.360]   you're writing an individual message
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.280]   that is self-contained and then it threads those together
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.960]   into an overwhelming structure, overarching structure
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   that may be overwhelming too.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.960]   - Overwhelming and overarching.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.720]   - That is, here's the list of things
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.160]   your friends have said recently
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.560]   and it may connect some of them back together
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.520]   into a thread, but the primary thing is the individual message.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.720]   Whereas Wave is the other way around,
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.440]   each Wave is a document and there may be threads within it,
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.760]   but they're not connected to the rest of the world at all
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.760]   and they'll only exist within that document.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.640]   They're not independent entities that are cloned in.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.160]   - I wanna add a fourth voice to the conversation.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.640]   Marshall Kirkpatrick is here of Read, Write web.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.280]   He contacted me and said, "I wanna talk about Wave too."
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.240]   And we're always glad to get Marshall on the show.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.200]   It's good to have you, Marshall.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.560]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.000]   We appreciate it.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.120]   So, somebody's asking in the friend feed room
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.360]   and I think this is an apt question,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.400]   is, I mean, I'll ask you first, Marshall,
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.720]   is Wave just a business application?
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.000]   Is there a individual, personal or public use for this?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.600]   - Oh, I imagine if it's successful,
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.840]   there'll be all kinds of different uses.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.640]   The permissioning will make a big difference
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.560]   in security in terms of business use
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.560]   and there'll be loads of personal uses as well.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.760]   It seems like a really, really ambitious project
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.680]   that ties together so many different things
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.760]   that it's hard to foresee
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.200]   what beyond collaboration in general
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.480]   that's gonna make possible.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.120]   - Are you happy, Kevin, with the structure of it?
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.800]   'Cause it does look very email-like.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.840]   You got folders on the left and you have viewing panes
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.000]   and you have a list pane.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.160]   I wonder if that's the, and certainly,
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.680]   Wave's not tied to that as we've seen.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.280]   It can look like anything.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.280]   What if that serves it or if it confuses people?
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.840]   If it looks too much like email?
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.480]   - Well, there's different bits to this.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.400]   So, the underlying thing is the protocol
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.280]   for editing and documenting the operational transform protocol
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.720]   and that's a bit they've worked on
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.520]   making interoperable so far.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.240]   The piece they haven't released yet
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.160]   is the bit that translates from that document on the server
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.960]   into the stuff on the web client.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.360]   And in fact, that whole protocol is a bit fluffy
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.000]   in that it's not well specified yet.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.880]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.400]   - It's very reliant on Google WebTalk,
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.840]   it's model of the world and how that's translation.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.280]   I know they're trying to change that.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.640]   But my strongest push back on them
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.440]   is that the document format they're using on the server
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.880]   is some arbitrarily made up XML thing.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.360]   And my take was you should use HTML
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.080]   or a subset of HTML for the document format
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.400]   because everyone in the world can display that.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.840]   So you could just, worst case,
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.400]   you could take the current state of that document
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   and feed it out to people as HTML.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.720]   And the push back I got from them was
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.680]   but HTML isn't very funny to operational transforms.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.200]   But I think that's like,
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.160]   that's like, we'll go do some more work then
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.280]   response from me because I can paste HTML into the wave
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.960]   and they do some munging into wave format
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.440]   and then push it through as an OT.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.480]   And then when I, someone else said it,
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.200]   it goes munch back to HTML to me.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.760]   So clearly there is a subset of HTML
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.440]   that will work with this,
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.520]   but they've decided they've made up their own document format.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.400]   And, you know, Tim Bray,
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.720]   who was one of the inventors of XML
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.320]   has written a beautiful post saying,
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.080]   "Don't invent XML document formats.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.320]   Use existing ones."
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.120]   And I think this is a strong case of that.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.640]   If the document format was actually HTML,
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.680]   then being able to build other presentation layers
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.520]   that show that will be much easier.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.040]   Whereas at the moment,
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.360]   the interoperability has mostly been done on the server side.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.080]   And if you look at the other client side interoperations,
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.760]   they're mostly a post a new message
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.000]   to the end of the feed thing
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.320]   and they don't have the complexity of this one
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.000]   because this one is doing like four transformations
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.720]   between what you type on the screen
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.400]   and what the other person sees on the screen
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.400]   because it's going from the browser side rendering
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.920]   into the OT which gets sent over to the server,
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.040]   which gets consolidated,
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.400]   which gets translated back into another OT,
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.480]   which then goes through a transformation,
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.560]   goes to your browser.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.960]   So it's going through several different document transforms
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.160]   on the way and as none of those are documented
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.440]   or specified yet,
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.960]   it's very hard for anyone else to sort of replace
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.800]   that part of it.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.200]   So for now, what we have is this way of editing model
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.040]   that we can see which is running on Google's code
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.840]   on Google servers.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.720]   They've federated the backend and they've federated
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.160]   how the edits get propagated and that stuff is,
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.320]   people have been building stuff that interoperates with that.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.280]   But the piece about the structure of the document
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.240]   is not really there yet.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.280]   And I'm hoping that'll come out in time,
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.200]   but I still have the concern that it is,
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.000]   it's a made up document,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.320]   yeah, another made up document format.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.320]   We already have too many of these.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.440]   - We don't need that.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.320]   I do like that XMPPs under the hood.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.000]   I mean, this seems like almost an instance of XMPP
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.280]   and how it can be used.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.240]   - Right.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.080]   Gina?
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.240]   - Well, I mean, it adds another requirement
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.520]   to your server setup if you want to run your own wave server.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.360]   - Oh, that's true.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.840]   - But hey, you know, the people who are going to run
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.400]   their own wave server are going to be people who,
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.600]   you know, have the resources
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.440]   and are going to be able to do that.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.120]   I mean, I don't know imagine it's that complicated.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.920]   And you'll, you know, disagree to a while back
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.120]   and some, there are so many, you know,
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.360]   protocols going on under the hood and, you know,
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.000]   makes it more complicated.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.560]   You know, it's hard to say.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.600]   You know, I think the thing about Wave
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.720]   that excites me so much is that it's just so open.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.960]   You know, there's so much potential.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.880]   Like this client and this server is just one way
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.280]   to implement this one protocol.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.680]   And since it's totally extensible and gadgets and bots,
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.560]   I just feel like there's so much potential.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.120]   I said before the show and I should say this to your listeners
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.080]   that I'm just totally not objective at this point.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.840]   I'm a complete not our fan girl.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.560]   - But that's, is that because you're a developer,
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.760]   do you think that you get so enthused?
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.160]   - Someone on Twitter said,
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.000]   "Wave is for developers egos.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.480]   The way complex jazz is for musicians."
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.400]   - Ah, yes.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.640]   - It speaks to you specifically.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.480]   - Yeah.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.280]   - And I, yeah, I felt that rang a little bell with me.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.920]   I mean, Lars Rasmussen waved at me this morning.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.920]   I mean, I might as well have been in Hollywood walking
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.600]   on this week and saw Angelina Jolie, like I almost died.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.520]   - It's like, it's like, it's like, it's brilliant.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.440]   I mean, he's like, "Hey, let me know if you have any questions."
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.400]   I was like, "Oh God, okay."
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.240]   - Yeah, Lars.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.400]   - So yeah, I'm just totally not objective.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.120]   I think part of it is that it really does speak to me
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:08.960]   as a developer.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.000]   I'm totally totally excited.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.960]   I will sleep about it again this week.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.320]   You know, a few of my contacts did come online
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.760]   and in this wave batch of invites.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.360]   And I've been using it all week and I'm excited about it.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.080]   I'm gonna start making my own gadgets for it.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.440]   And so, yeah.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.840]   - What kind of things do you wanna make, Gina?
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.120]   - You know, this is the thing.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.080]   It's kind of hard for me to figure out.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.160]   I mean, like getting your email in a wave,
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.280]   that to me doesn't sound very useful.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.400]   I was thinking about writing something from my own product,
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.880]   which is a Twitter client.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.240]   I would like to, for instance, make one tweet a wave
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.400]   and then all replies to that tweet feed in
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.520]   as comments on that wave.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.360]   So that's gonna be my first--
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.200]   - Who I like that.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.160]   - Yeah, that's gonna be my first gadget or bot.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.600]   Not sure exactly how to do it, but I,
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.440]   since I have, you know, threaded tweets on my server,
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.760]   I'm gonna see if I can feed those out to wave that way.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.320]   And then I would like to be able to embed that wave somewhere,
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.280]   yeah, so people can see.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.000]   So that's gonna be my first little wave development.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.280]   In fact, Kevin, I might be hitting you up
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.640]   for development advice.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.640]   (laughs)
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.000]   - Since the-- - I'm gonna try.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.200]   - The ribby gadget, by the way, is incredible.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.360]   I know Kevin's too modest to say it, but it's awesome.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.200]   - Unbelievable, yeah.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.400]   - I did a conference call with Kevin and his coworker
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.600]   and I was really blown away.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.560]   I never do demos.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.040]   I was so glad that I did that.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:20.960]   It's really amazing.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.800]   - I haven't used it yet.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.640]   I have one set up.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.080]   Kevin asked, invited me, and I just didn't get a chance.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   Kevin, why don't you tell us a little bit
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.640]   about this, Ribbit module, or what do you call it, a bot?
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.080]   - It's a gadget. - It's a gadget.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:32.920]   - It's a gadget. - It's a gadget.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.400]   - Ribbit conference gadget, we call it.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.640]   - Okay. - So, well, what it is is,
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.360]   we looked at Wave and looked at it as this collaboration tool
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.600]   where you're working with people on the same document.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.080]   And it's very, very textual.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.720]   You're talking back and forth through text,
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.000]   you're editing stuff together.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.080]   There's this conversation going on.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.920]   And we thought, well, there's a lot of scenarios
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.040]   where we're doing that, but when we do it,
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.440]   we're having a telephone call together
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.360]   and talking about the same thing at the same time.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.480]   So we're either discussing the document and saying,
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.440]   should we do this, should we do that, and settling it,
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.240]   or you're having a conference call or a chat
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.360]   like we're having now, and someone's taking notes
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.520]   and people want to join in the notes.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.000]   And the tools for doing that at the moment aren't great.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.680]   So we said, well, clearly it would be great
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.680]   if the conference and the Wave were integrated together.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.000]   How can we do that?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.980]   So what we'd set it up was that you add the bot to the Wave.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.560]   Should I try doing this?
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.400]   Am I in the right Wave?
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.240]   Oh, there you go.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.080]   You just got that one. - Yep.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.320]   - So you add the bot to the Wave, and then--
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.080]   - I put a phony number in there, Kevin,
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.600]   because otherwise it shows my actual number.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.760]   - Okay, yeah, that's not--
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.000]   - So you can't call me at this point,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.760]   but in theory, I'd put a real number in here.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.760]   - Yes, so what does it shows you your own number,
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.000]   and it doesn't show you anyone else's?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.200]   Everyone who adds their number can be called,
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.840]   then you click Start Conference,
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.560]   all their phones ring, you're in a conference call,
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.200]   you can talk.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.840]   It shows you the current state of the call.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.440]   I mean, if you click it, it'll call me and not you, probably.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.400]   And then you can have your conversation
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.680]   while the Wave's going on.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.200]   - It's using VoIP, though.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.120]   It's not using, I mean, it's from BT.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.600]   Is it using a VoIP system?
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.720]   How is it--
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.400]   - What it's using is the underlying RIBIT telephony engine,
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.920]   which lets you connect calls between anything and anything.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   So this is, at the moment, we're just making it
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.880]   switch to US phone numbers,
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.280]   which doesn't work internationally yet.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.720]   - All right, I'm gonna put a real phone number in there.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   I won't show this on the air,
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.120]   but I will put a real phone number in,
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.360]   and then we can, if I start this conference,
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.840]   are you, can you answer the phone?
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.040]   - Sure, I've got it, I've got a phone here,
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.880]   so it should ring in the--
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.680]   - Let's see what happens, it says it's dialing.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.520]   And now I'm talking to Kevin over the phone.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.400]   - And I'll turn it over to the phone,
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.600]   and, oh, yeah, this was,
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.360]   we do get about this a week, and I get a lot of echo.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.640]   - You shouldn't be getting any echo, right?
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.640]   Now, is it all right?
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.520]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.440]   - Yeah, so that's, I'll turn my headphones off
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.840]   because I'm hearing through that.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.400]   (laughing)
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.360]   So that's the point, the point is you can do a conference call
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.040]   with the people who are in the wave,
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.360]   set that up, have that going,
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.600]   and then go back to collaborating on the--
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.000]   - And now we're typing on the wave,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.240]   but we're also talking.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.680]   And that's gonna solve one problem with Wave,
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.840]   which is a lot of the side conversations
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.960]   end up in the wave, and kind of, you get all this--
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.800]   - Right.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.120]   - It gets crazy, it'd be nice to have a side channel
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.640]   that actually doesn't end up in the wave.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.480]   - Yeah, and the other thing is that you can add people
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.680]   to the wave, they can put their phone numbers in,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.400]   and then if you're having the meeting
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.480]   and not all of them are online,
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.360]   you'll phone out for them
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.720]   and be able to talk to them about bits of it as well.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:34.200]   So it's sort of bridging the mode of being on the phone
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.360]   in the conference call,
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.080]   and being in this collaborative document,
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.840]   and that's, I think you get some richness
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.680]   from both sides from that,
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.720]   that was the underlying point.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.640]   Anyway, I should hang up on this--
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.000]   - Yeah, put your headphones back on.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.920]   (laughing)
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.120]   And I'll turn everybody else back up now.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.720]   Go ahead, you can talk, and I'm gonna--
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.440]   - Are there any kind of whiteboard apps for it,
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.840]   so you can do collaborative sketching and stuff?
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.120]   - Would that be cool, it seems like there should be,
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.440]   maybe even save a recording of the conference
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.560]   into the wave and things like that.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.040]   - This use case in particular makes sense to me,
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.640]   that phone calls, but I do wonder how many of these
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.080]   types of functionality and bots and what have you,
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:14.080]   wouldn't be more simply offered as standalone applications.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.040]   At what point, where do you draw the line?
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.000]   At what point is being part of wave add value,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.200]   and more value than it is complication?
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.760]   - Give us a platform for it, doesn't it?
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.600]   - It's an easy--
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.840]   - It's a usual trade-off, I mean,
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.320]   the point for this one was that
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.160]   the ordinary conference call experience is
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.240]   everyone dials into a number and types in another number,
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.000]   and you spend five or 10 minutes doing that
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.760]   before anything works, and with this,
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.880]   if you could just, because you've got the set of people
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.280]   who know who they are, and they can add their contact details
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.320]   to it, it becomes a one click to bring them all back
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.840]   into the conference, or the subset of them that you want.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.480]   So I think the goal there was ease of,
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.240]   I've already set this group up,
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.320]   let me call into them as well, correlation there.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.600]   I think, you know, yeah, you can bridge
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.080]   into other apps too, we could bridge that out to Skype,
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.040]   we have the technologies to do it,
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.760]   the question is the user interface
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.800]   that gets a bit more complicated,
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.400]   you've got to put a Skype ID in as well as a phone number,
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.720]   and that's something we're working on
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.320]   to try and make easier.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.760]   But the other half of this is,
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.920]   if you choose to use, you know,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.840]   this is what we were saying earlier,
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.240]   but maybe before you're honest,
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.360]   that because Wave is different from the message-based things,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.400]   the individual message thread stuff,
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.960]   once you start using Wave as your collaborative document,
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.080]   you sort of have to keep using it because it is--
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:31.920]   - Right.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.240]   - It is the sort of--
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   - It's the definitive repository.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.400]   Yeah, it's the canonical source, yeah.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.480]   - Here's my crude question.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.240]   Can you envision people getting rich using Wave?
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.920]   - Oh, I like that question.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.760]   - That's a good question.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.760]   - When I was speaking to the online--
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.200]   - You will make money on top of Facebook so far,
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.240]   including my son.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.040]   - Right.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   - Is this commercial soon?
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.960]   - So potentially, one of the things we're looking at
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.440]   with the Ribbit Gacha is,
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.280]   conference calling is a fairly big business.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.960]   BT makes a lot of money from doing conference calling already.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.920]   So how do you package that up in a way that's useful to people?
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.560]   What features make sense as a free app?
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.760]   And what makes sense is evaluated at.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.760]   We could transcribe the calls and post the transcriptions
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.840]   back into the Wave for people,
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.760]   was that a service people would pay for?
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.800]   There's a bunch of possibilities there,
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   and we're still working out what might work and what might not,
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.160]   and what we package up for different people.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.040]   I mean, the other thing is that with the Ribbit stuff,
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.240]   we've got our own API for this.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.320]   So if other people want to do telephony apps,
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.080]   they can write to our API,
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.760]   and we'll work out the billing parts for the bits that cost money,
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.280]   and the bits that are free will get passed through.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:43.000]   So somebody asked about, what's this easy to write?
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.240]   And the Wave part was reasonably easy in that it's basically web development.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.160]   You're building a gadget, which is very like building a website,
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.640]   with some extra bits of magic blue,
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.000]   because there's shared state and stuff.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.560]   And the Ribbit stuff, we already had an SDK for that.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.920]   So a lot of it was like just wiring some calls together.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.080]   It's like, okay, here's a set of people,
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.320]   you need to get phone numbers for them,
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.000]   here's a set of people and phone numbers.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.640]   So, you know, I'm not belittling the guys who spent a lot of time hacking away on this.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.000]   There was a chunk of work there.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.360]   But at its heart, it was web development.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.400]   It was the models we're used to.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.480]   That's one of the nice things about Wave,
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.920]   and I think why Gene is excited about it,
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.560]   is it feels quite web-y in lots of ways.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:25.160]   The hooks, the gadgets are very like creating web pages,
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.400]   and the bots are like doing CGI or something.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.480]   You get a thing you send a response back.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.680]   Is it pretty easy to write a bot, Gene?
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.840]   Is that something that's not so hard to do?
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.680]   I don't believe that it's that difficult to do.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.320]   I'll be honest, I haven't dove into the code.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.200]   Most of the bots right now are hosted on AppSpot,
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.280]   and they're written in Python, because that's what AppSpot,
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.840]   yeah, Python is AppSpot.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.200]   But yeah, I've seen bots that, you know,
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.640]   high school kids have turned out pretty quickly.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.120]   And, you know, bots have to do pretty simple things,
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.200]   like link at usernames to Twitter,
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.200]   or turn a colon and a parentheses into a smiley face.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.480]   You know, that's a pretty simple thing.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.040]   A bot can update content in a wave,
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   so it scans a wave and then it makes changes,
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:08.440]   like turns a little bit into--
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.800]   The translation bot does it, yeah.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   Right, right, right.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.720]   And that does appear to be pretty simple,
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.120]   although I haven't yet dove into development.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.680]   So I'll let you know next week.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.920]   This week is my Wave development week, so.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.760]   Oh, good.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:25.200]   What is the percentage for Google in this?
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.760]   Is it just another Google Docs-like collaborative environment?
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.840]   Marshall, what do you think Google's up to here?
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.160]   Oh, I think that if they can transform communication online,
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:41.280]   as radically as this appears intended to do,
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.760]   then they could do things like create a whole economy
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:50.080]   of premium widgets, they could run advertisements on it,
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:54.480]   and it's just more Google at the center of our online lives.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.040]   So if they can pull it off,
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.120]   I think it's a huge win for them.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.560]   - Yaleo, I think that one of Google's weaknesses,
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.480]   we've talked about this in the show, is the live web.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.560]   And that's why the interest in Twitter, of course.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.400]   - Also the real time web, you mean?
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.880]   - That's what I mean, yeah, the real time web.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.240]   And so rather than just buying Twitter,
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.080]   which God doesn't still could do,
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.160]   even though it's worth a billion dollars now,
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.240]   it also becomes part of the structure
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.160]   of creating the next generation of the live web,
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.320]   of the stream web.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.440]   And I think that that's something that puts it
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.080]   at the center of whatever comes next.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.240]   It's kind of post page, post site,
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.120]   and it's a new web that's being invented here.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.480]   And if they're at the center of it and have been created,
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.760]   that's gotta be powerful.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.160]   - That makes sense to me,
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.560]   but I want to push back a little bit on the idea
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.000]   that they are feeling threatened by Twitter.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.400]   I've been speaking to a whole bunch of real time web companies
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.840]   over the last few weeks in preparation for an event
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.280]   on the topic.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.600]   And there's so much more to the real time web already
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.960]   than just Twitter.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.920]   - Sure.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.240]   - And even the search engine companies are finding
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.320]   that Twitter isn't providing enough links,
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.440]   that there's not enough link sharing going on on Twitter
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.120]   for them to build a good full index.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:13.960]   So they're incredibly--
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.280]   - Well, we agree that what I saw wave,
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.840]   the first thing I said was they didn't just
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.360]   buy Twitter, they went three steps beyond it.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.200]   - Yeah, we agree.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.120]   - And Twitter's not perfect.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.280]   I'm noticing that by the way,
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.280]   one of the top trending topics on Twitter right now
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.680]   is Leo Laport makes $1.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.760]   So I have--
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.920]   - You click it, you get nothing.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.360]   So I don't know what that is.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.200]   It's still--
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.600]   - It was, you make $1.5 million or something.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.440]   - No, $1.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.720]   (laughing)
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.920]   - I just wanted to mention that a wave called this week
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.080]   in Google Wave was spontaneously created
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.520]   and there's quite a, the made public
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.040]   and quite a few people are in it right now.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.800]   - Our listeners made a wave.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.160]   Our listeners made a wave.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.640]   - So this is like instantaneous real time community,
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.520]   just kind of, you know, showing up someplace.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.960]   So it's just a pretty cool, pretty cool use.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.800]   I mean, it's basically--
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.200]   - I don't wanna find that, yeah.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.360]   - It's called this week in Google Wave.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.040]   So do a search for with, colon, public space
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.040]   and then do this week in Google and quotes
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:09.880]   and you should be able to find it.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.720]   - So because it's public,
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.320]   we don't need to be added to it to read it.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.720]   - Right, but to find it,
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.080]   use the with colon public operator.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.560]   - That was a really great operator.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.840]   Gina passed along to me.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.920]   Because if you just do with colon public
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.720]   and nothing else, you'll see all the public waves.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.360]   And it's a good way to see what people are doing.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.200]   A lot of it's silly,
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.480]   but it's a good way to see what's going on.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.400]   I was like looking at the public timeline early on
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   in the days of Twitter.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.120]   So I could be with colon public and then space twig.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.800]   - And then space and then do actually,
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.760]   the name of the title of the wave is this weekend Google Wave.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.520]   So if you put in quotes this week in Google Wave,
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.120]   it'll be the only one actually that shows up.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.400]   - Right.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.000]   And there are 134 posts in there already.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.920]   So it's quite busy.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.000]   - Yeah, it is quite busy.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.080]   - Yeah.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.360]   - So that's a very interesting use, unexpected.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.560]   You know, with public search,
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.400]   you know, once you do a search
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.280]   and you add yourself to a public wave,
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.320]   or I think maybe just once you do the search,
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.080]   public waves start automatically showing up
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.160]   in your inbox and things get nuts immediately.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.480]   - That explains it.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.920]   - Giant sea of moving waves.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.920]   - I don't understand.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.400]   I have a ton of stuff in there.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.240]   Okay.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.120]   - Yeah. So Lars actually left a comment
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.280]   on my post on Life Hacker saying that they're going to make it
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.000]   so that public waves don't show up in your inbox automatically.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.200]   And he apologized and he said,
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.840]   it's going to take a few weeks for that to roll out,
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.240]   but that that won't always be the case.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.120]   So.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.080]   - Well, I think it's a great privilege in some ways
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:41.080]   for us to be watching side as they've worked this stuff out
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.040]   and as users figure out what wave is
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.160]   and the developers respond.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.280]   - It's an incredible time to be a user.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.520]   It's an incredible time to be a user.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.360]   I spent pretty much all week with my friends
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.320]   who had just gotten on who, you know,
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.480]   that would be the only person that knew anything about it.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.320]   Who would wave at me and say,
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.640]   show me what this is.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.360]   And it was just so much fun to show them
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.120]   and then to watch documentation, you know,
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.240]   coming up fast and furious on wave itself
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.800]   and watching users who don't know one another,
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.480]   educating one another and bringing up issues.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.240]   It's a fantastic time to be a user.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.920]   And I feel terrible that it's invite only.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.400]   I feel terrible for all the people who want
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.520]   so desperately an invite.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.520]   - You get eight nominations when you get an account
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.840]   and then the nominations will trickle out.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.520]   I know at least one of my nominations has gone out
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.480]   as an invite, but they don't happen instantaneously.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.840]   And is it kosher or is it not kosher
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.520]   to have more than one wave account?
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.480]   - That's a good question.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.080]   I don't know, I've only got one.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.600]   - I have two.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.440]   - Oh.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.120]   - Well, you're the president of the internet though, you know?
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.920]   And you should have at least--
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   - I feel a little guilty.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.280]   I'm not sure if I broke a rule or not.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.800]   I have one that's my personal kind of,
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.000]   I think of it as my personal one.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.320]   And then one is the, is the Twitch one.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.040]   - Well, yeah, I mean, actually I have a developer account.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.200]   So I guess I've got more than one.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.320]   - Did your developer account not get converted though
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.640]   into a--
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.200]   - No, separate account, separate server.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.320]   - Oh, so I guess I have three then.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.160]   - Yeah, yeah, I guess I can.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.920]   - 'Cause you might still have my sandbox account, yeah.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.880]   - Yeah, I got three as well.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.120]   So we're both breaking rules.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.840]   Although the build, I believe the client build
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.720]   and the server build on the dev preview box
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.240]   is a little different.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.960]   I don't know, Kevin, maybe you can clarify.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.160]   I think it's an older or, I don't know if they updated it.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.080]   - I don't know the exact details,
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.160]   but they are different builds
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.480]   because you see different menus on them
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.200]   and the structure is slightly different.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.640]   And I suspect that they will roll out new changes
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.920]   to dev one before they work to this one.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.440]   - I've seen incredibly brave of the rest of the moosons
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.000]   to put this out here at this stage in its development.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:38.840]   Don't you think?
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.680]   - Got C.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.000]   - I mean, you're kind of letting it all hang out.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.440]   They see the reason for it though,
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.320]   because you need the network effect to really test it.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.000]   You need people to write bots and extensions for it
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.520]   to extend it, so you need that.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.160]   But still pretty gutsy to say.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.560]   - Yeah, you're right, Leo, 'cause I see that.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.200]   I see snarking about it from the most ridiculous quarters,
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.360]   from people who developed other things earlier,
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.960]   I won't say which ones,
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.040]   and who are almost kind of jealous of the attention
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.960]   that's getting, and it's an alpha.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.360]   It's so damned early,
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.200]   but that's where it's gonna be part of the--
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.320]   - Do you think we are giving it?
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.520]   I mean, this is a Google show,
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.680]   but do you think we're giving it too much attention?
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.080]   I mean, is this like saying, I don't know,
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.240]   oh look, Google Docs, whoo, it's--
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.240]   - Well, Leo, to go to your magnificent online
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.720]   news association speech,
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.080]   if you were still trying to do,
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.360]   and by the way, it's really, really good folks,
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.920]   and go watch it, I embedded it at newsinnovation.com.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.000]   - Wow, like Lush.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.400]   - But as you were saying there,
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.800]   if you're trying to make a cable network
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.760]   for millions of people,
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.520]   yeah, we're giving it way too much attention.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.320]   But for your highly targeted audience of--
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.320]   - Right.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.160]   - Geeks will know more than I do.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.000]   - I think they care.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.920]   - It's the perfect topic.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.760]   - Sure, I think they care.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.800]   - What does this mean for us?
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.840]   What can we do with this?
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.160]   It's clay to be played with.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.280]   - Right.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.280]   And it's true that you're not gonna see those conversations
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.480]   on the, you're not gonna see the Today Show
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.240]   talking about Google Wave.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.080]   I don't think-- - Well, but yeah.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.840]   - Gina was on NPR, I did an interview
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.680]   for Channel 4 News London.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.240]   - Oh, there is interest then.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.880]   - And by the way, when I went on Channel 4,
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.200]   they warned me before I got on.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.160]   Can you please not make any tsunami references?
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.080]   - Oh, jeez, yes, you're right.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.720]   - I have that much sense, thank you, yes.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.000]   - Matt cuts in the friend feed room says it has,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.120]   it's a, he wonders if it has anything to do
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.800]   with the way they use the word wave on Firefly.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.640]   I don't remember them.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.640]   What are they-- - It is, it is.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.840]   It is Firefly inspired on purpose.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.320]   Yeah, and that everything is shiny.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.760]   Captain, error messages also from Firefly.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.760]   It's all fireflies. - I recognize that.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.720]   But what do they, how do they use the word wave
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.560]   on Firefly?
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.920]   I don't remember that part.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.640]   - They've sent them a wave.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.920]   If you actually watch them,
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.680]   when they're communicating over the net,
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.960]   it's on ships. - It's a wave.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.200]   - They said, well, send them a wave.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.720]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.480]   I like it even more now.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.200]   - Yeah, I'm because-- - Like partner
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.880]   in real life, you've been shorting on.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.880]   (laughing)
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.240]   - How can you go wrong with that?
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.360]   That's pretty cool.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   So Matt, yes, you think Matt would know this,
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.480]   but yes, apparently it is, in fact.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.120]   That's why they call it a wave.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.840]   - So how long until this gets out of Google
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.480]   and becomes a distributed protocol?
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.800]   - I'd love to a server.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.080]   I really would love to run a server.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.920]   The race is on.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.360]   And the smart companies are coding their servers
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.760]   and clients right now, I think,
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.960]   because Google's the first one to market,
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.200]   but I think this is--
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.440]   I think this is--
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.520]   - Oh, you mean there's no reason?
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.360]   This is all public?
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.280]   There's no reason somebody couldn't just do it?
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.120]   - So I'm not-- - So the--
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.640]   - I haven't looked into the internals.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.160]   Go ahead, Kevin.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.160]   - So the protocol and the code for the servers is public.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.120]   There's a open source project
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.520]   that gives you a server that the Google released.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.440]   - Oh.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.920]   - A month, a couple of months ago.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.680]   And people are starting to put them up.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.120]   So if you follow the dev list,
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.240]   you were saying I've got my server up here.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.880]   People are working back and forth.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.320]   So far, I don't think you can point
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.960]   the Google client at another server.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.600]   I think that's something people are trying
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.440]   to work out of you now.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.480]   - Yeah, we need to have federation.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.400]   - So the federation is built into the protocol
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.480]   as part of the design.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:59.480]   You're able to have waves where some of the wavelets
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.200]   which are the individual sub threads
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.120]   are on different servers.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.960]   That's by design in the protocol now.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.000]   And how much that's been tested, I don't know yet.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.360]   But that's certainly, if you follow the spec groups,
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.440]   that that's been discussed.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.200]   And there was a lot of careful work on security protocols
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.400]   to make sure that waves can't spoof one another there as well.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.240]   - Yeah, there's a lot of work to--
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.400]   - It's the identity stored.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.240]   - Go ahead.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.080]   - Is that some odd--
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.160]   - Is identity centralized?
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.280]   - Yeah, no, the identity is on the server you're on.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.920]   So we're, whatever we are at the, what's the domain?
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.040]   - You can't wait.google.com.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.800]   - We were Kevin Marks at Wave Sandbox.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.640]   - Got it.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.480]   - .com before.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.640]   - That's a sensible way to do it.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.840]   - So it's an email like identifier,
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.720]   but it belongs to the root server
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.880]   that owns the place where you originate the waves.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.360]   And part of the point is that you're supposed to be able
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.760]   to have a conversation with people on your own server,
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.280]   and that will never leave that and get federated
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.320]   unless you invite someone from another server.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.880]   That's part of the sort of lower level design
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.120]   of the protocol.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.120]   What are the dangers of and controls on spam?
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:10.040]   - Well, that's the piece that they're still talking about.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.880]   The controls are better than email
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.400]   in that you can't spoof the address.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.560]   It has to be signed.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.240]   So you can't pretend to be somebody else.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.640]   - Fantastic. - So that's there.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.000]   But the piece, as I said earlier,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.800]   the piece that's missing is that if someone has your address,
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.080]   they can add you to waves,
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.120]   which is the thing we were discussing earlier.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:30.120]   So it still has the assumption that if someone has your identifier,
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.120]   they can put stuff at the top of your inbox.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.480]   And that's the piece that they haven't worked through.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.240]   And I suspect part of the bringing that out in public
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.000]   is to stretch that case.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.600]   Because obviously when they're only doing it within a closed group,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.320]   within Google and then a smaller closed group within developers,
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.240]   those issues aren't gonna be as clear as they are
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.400]   as they add more and more people to it.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.680]   - Does a wave server have some sort of inbound capacity,
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.280]   a pop server or something?
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.600]   - No, not directly.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.960]   It's more that the protocol federates.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.720]   So it needs to be-- - So you'd have to actively choose
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.360]   to federate to pick up that wave.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.760]   - You have to invite someone on another server.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.040]   And then that would create the connection
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.240]   and it would propagate over the state of the wave.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:15.080]   And then the changes they made would get propagated back.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.120]   - So as long as that's done properly,
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.720]   it sounds like that would also protect you.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:18.760]   If you run your own server,
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.960]   only those you choose to participate would participate.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.600]   - Yes.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.120]   - Kevin, do you know if there's much communication going on
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:33.120]   between the wave folks and the Hubs app, Hub Hub and Webfinger,
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:36.560]   and those groups in Google?
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.080]   - Well, I don't know in detail,
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.160]   'cause it's obviously not there anymore.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:45.120]   But they've got different, they're doing different things.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.840]   So, this is what I was saying at the beginning is that
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.080]   wave is primarily there's a shared document
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.520]   with a shared with a state on one server
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.240]   and you're sending updates to that place.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:01.520]   Whereas Pub/Sub Hub Hub and the other things
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.280]   that I like that are focused on,
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.480]   here's an individual message that's standalone,
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.480]   let's make sure that gets propagated out.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.960]   So Brett, Brett did say when I spoke to him
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.000]   on Gilmore Game this week about Pub/Sub Hub Hub,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.280]   he said, well, you could run Wave over Pub/Sub Hub
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.840]   instead of running it over XMPP.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.120]   But that's not actually a very helpful response
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.160]   because you could do for sending the individual messages,
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.480]   but the actual consensual state is different.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:32.480]   The state in Twitter and in Feeds is,
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.440]   here's a set of individual entries you have an array of them
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.120]   and they may refer to each other by links,
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.600]   but that's all they can do.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.560]   Whereas the state in Wave, the core state is,
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.480]   here's a document underneath and there are some little bits
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.880]   inside that that are edits to that document.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.240]   And the comments and the blips that appear
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.760]   are edits on that document,
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.600]   they're not separate places.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.000]   It's so much to wrap my head around,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.160]   I'm just boggled by the whole thing.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.360]   And it sounds like it's not the only real-time initiative
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.360]   within Google.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.200]   - Sure.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.040]   - Yeah.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.120]   - It does not buy long shot.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.160]   - Not buy long shot, exactly Marshall,
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.600]   to answer your question, yeah.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.880]   - It'd be interesting, it could be that the Wave clients
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.640]   that are very successful are the ones that pair things down
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.120]   and make this a little more simple.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:26.120]   Maybe Google's Wave client is too complex
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.320]   and other clients that come out will make it a little simpler
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.840]   and maybe hide a little of the complexity.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.080]   But what I'm excited about is that there are so many
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.160]   possibilities.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.920]   - That's one of the things.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.920]   - That's one of the things that I'm concerned about,
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:44.080]   that there are so many real-time initiatives going on
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:49.080]   all over the web and usability is one of the concerns
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.000]   that's foremost in people's minds.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   And each of these individual tasks are challenging enough
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.720]   to create a compelling and effective user experience
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.600]   for people who are just moving into this real-time world
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.960]   and piling all of these different forms of functionality
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:12.600]   into one real-time experience
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:17.600]   is really gonna be a challenge to nail UX-wise.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.720]   - But this has been a lesson that I've learned today
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.960]   is that we're overloading Wave perhaps a little bit
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.040]   or I was overloading Wave perhaps a little bit.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.280]   It isn't all of the things that I thought it was.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.160]   If you think of it simply as a collaborative
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.680]   or real-time collaborative environment,
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.840]   it's much simpler, much more straightforward
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.680]   and not quite so daunting.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.280]   And it doesn't have to be all things to all people.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.080]   - I think that's part of coming out of the sort of
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.280]   the beta period.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.320]   As soon as when you've got a product that you've seen demos
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.160]   of and has been described, people project their own view
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.600]   of what it could be onto it.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.360]   And then when it actually comes out, they say,
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.840]   well, it isn't what I thought it was.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.880]   It's disappointing and they write lots of long rants
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.520]   about how disappointed they are by it.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.760]   And that's always a problem when you're bringing out
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.600]   a new product.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.800]   I think the difference and a nail's objections
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.640]   that they're not using web protocols had some substance
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.840]   to it, I said about the document protocol being made up
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.400]   and that not me a great idea.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.520]   But the fact that they've come up with a standardized protocol
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.520]   for distributed editing to a document,
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.640]   that's very powerful and very interesting,
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.520]   that has a lot of implications for things
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.040]   that people could do in the future.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.800]   And that will be a lot of other stuff
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.280]   built on top of this as well.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.160]   And they've coupled together a lot of pieces
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.360]   to build this thing as one product.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.320]   But there's some components there that are interesting
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.520]   and other things will be able to use those too.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.280]   And I expect we'll see more of that over time as well.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.360]   (chuckles)
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.760]   Have we exhausted the subject?
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.360]   Is there anything, I mean, we've got four really great,
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.560]   smart people, all of us trying to understand,
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.880]   well, five if you include me,
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.160]   all of us trying to, which I don't,
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.360]   trying to understand this.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:02.720]   I feel like I get a better sense of it.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.560]   I'm excited by it.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.800]   I still don't know exactly how I would use it.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.760]   For instance, we kind of tried fitfully to use it
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:10.800]   for the show and it's not, I mean,
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.720]   there are better platforms to do what we want to do
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.760]   for the show, for instance.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.760]   - Yeah, which is publishing, right?
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.680]   I mean, we all want to publish.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.520]   Jeff wants to publish, I want to publish.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.360]   - Right.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.920]   - We want to publish because not everybody's in it.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.680]   So you can see it unless you can--
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.040]   - It's not good for a public-facing thing.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.680]   It's good for a small group,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.440]   or maybe a large group that's collaborating
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.600]   on something together.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.440]   - Yeah.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.760]   - But I think the answer to your question, Marshall,
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.640]   is when you can publish and others can see it,
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.360]   if not use it, it has that use,
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.040]   whether that's within an enterprise or not.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.000]   I would love to find some way to have kind of
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.120]   the next prize right now for it to say,
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.680]   come in and take the use case of three journalists,
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.920]   two editors and five witnesses
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.920]   and how they can cover a breaking story using way
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:58.400]   and use their PCs and their phones to do it
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.560]   and use various media including video
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.880]   and audio and photos to do it.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.880]   And start to flush that out.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.320]   I'm gonna get very excited about that.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.840]   I know I can't do it.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:07.680]   - Well, you--
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.600]   - But that's the kind of thing where you have a use case.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.000]   - I know, Jeff, you've seen the site,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.080]   all voices that is a kind of,
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.320]   I think I just love it.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:18.320]   It's a global kind of user generated site for news.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.960]   I can imagine something like all voices
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.960]   making kind of a wavelet around a breaking story
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.120]   where people could add their content,
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.640]   add their commentary, but it would still have to be edited.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.480]   It would still have to--
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.320]   - Well, I can imagine the New York Times
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.960]   during the Iran story.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:34.800]   I mean, during the Iran story.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.800]   - It's when you would be a perfect example, yeah.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.480]   - New York Times, Guardian, Huffington Post
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.560]   and Andrew Sullivan were the best at pulling in the tweets
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.160]   that were out there in the world.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.000]   - Right.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.360]   - Well, now imagine if the four of them,
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.240]   and maybe a few others,
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.400]   Moran could have collaborated not just with tweets
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.040]   through blog, but also with putting it in the tweet,
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.560]   saying, no, that was not right.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.400]   This one's right.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.240]   I know who that is.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.080]   Here's a photo.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:58.920]   Here's a caption for that photo.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.440]   Let me correct that.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.360]   Let me add a video.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.200]   Let's have a little interview about this topic.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.840]   And it all becomes part of a document
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:09.120]   that is the latest, the best view of the Iran story.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   - That's my dream for it.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.640]   Maybe I'm wrong, but that's where I think you can do it.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   - I think you're, yeah, it's absolutely perfect.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.520]   - So there's a startup up in Seattle called Every.
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:20.800]   That's a semantic web recommendation tool for publishers.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:24.920]   And they publish related content to news stories.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.920]   And one of the things they're doing is watching Twitter
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.600]   for emerging news trends and using those as a trigger
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:36.120]   to prompt a query of other mainstream media sources,
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.440]   photo sharing sites, and to go and check Wikipedia,
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.400]   free base, other places like that for changes
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:47.000]   to the pages concerning these emerging news entities.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.480]   And then they collate all of that information together
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.760]   to produce a related content, a topic page
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.600]   that they push them out to their publisher customers.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:01.080]   And I can imagine bots performing that kind of functionality,
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:06.080]   perhaps to create some, an instant research bundle
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:10.640]   for your way of that you're collaboratively writing.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.480]   - Right, Marshall.
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.000]   - I'm a partner at Daylight which is a competitor to every.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.680]   And yes, we could do just that as bringing that data.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:17.920]   And if you look at what, for example,
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.120]   SAP is doing with their way of outlet,
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:24.600]   they wanna have a customer be able to interact with a bot
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.640]   to answer a customer service question
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.400]   and then record that and then reuse that
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.520]   as a way to get ever better answers
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.960]   to customer service questions.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.480]   So the combination of the human and the automatic
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.480]   also becomes very interesting.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.080]   - There's a whole spectrum I've found
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.120]   in this real time web stuff.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.240]   On one end, you've got human to human communication.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.360]   On the other end, you've got machine to machine communication
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.420]   using real time protocols.
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.640]   And then there's a bunch of stuff in the middle
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.680]   that where humans and machines have mediated communication
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.400]   like Ardberg, they use this presence
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:03.000]   and people and some of the same XMPP protocols,
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.840]   stuff like that.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.000]   - Wow.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.440]   - So, Jeff, I mean, the interesting thing about that
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.560]   is it's like the stuff that Eric Schmidt
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:16.640]   and Marissa Mayer have been saying to the newspapers,
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.840]   which is if you make a page that is the focus
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:21.840]   at the ongoing focus of the story,
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.520]   then you've got a chance to compete with Wikipedia
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.080]   because they have a page about a minajad and Iran and so on.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.800]   And when people search for that, that will be high up
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.960]   because that's our sort of locus of current knowledge.
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.120]   And they've been saying, you write a story,
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.400]   you write a story, and then each day there's a new story,
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.160]   there isn't a focus page for that.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.560]   And that's something they've been pushing back to them.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.800]   Say, do you want to be web-like,
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.840]   make somewhere we can go for the current state of the world?
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.440]   And that's a sort of mental shift
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.320]   that's difficult for the papers to do, I think.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.520]   - Well, and then now I think,
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.400]   was they finally start to get their hands around
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.960]   the neck of that idea.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.800]   It then blows up again.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.760]   I've been right, I'm waiting to write this post for a while
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.040]   that you have a conflict now
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:02.520]   between hyper concentration and hyper distribution.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:05.120]   In hyper concentration, you want to be the place,
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.360]   so you beat Wikipedia, just what you just said.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:10.040]   But you also want to be, as Marissa has been talking about,
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.560]   and now, in the last week, Eric's been talking about,
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.160]   you want to insinuate yourself
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.160]   into people's hyper personal news streams.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.480]   You want to be out where they are,
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.400]   you want to be distributed everywhere.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.880]   And so Google has to understand
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.560]   not only those hyper concentrated points,
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.000]   those laser light points
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.760]   where all the content comes together,
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:31.240]   but recognizes that people are going to distribute this stuff.
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.960]   And I think Wave becomes,
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.400]   this is a nascent thought,
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.840]   becomes part and parcel of that,
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:37.720]   because you can use it to publish a page
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:39.160]   that has all this stuff in it,
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:41.600]   but then you can feed out of it,
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.800]   not only to the web, but also to my Twitter
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   or to, you know, bots and widgets all over.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:52.120]   And you are, once both concentrated,
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.760]   you have a locus for that story.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.040]   It's kind of almost a DNS for knowledge.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:59.240]   And then you have things distributed all over.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.080]   - Right.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.480]   - Or also, I've still got more seen in my system.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:02.320]   I don't know.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.080]   (laughing)
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.600]   - Well, I mean, this is a debate
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.800]   I had with Marissa at full camp,
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:11.440]   because there is this issue that the way we use Twitter
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.320]   and the way we use Friend Feed and all the,
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.960]   and blocking and all these systems
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.640]   is that we're starting to use other people
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.560]   as our filters on the world, rather than institutions.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.680]   And listening to Marissa and Eric talk about this,
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.040]   they're still thinking about institutions,
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:24.880]   not about people.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.160]   And it's partly a Google blind spot,
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.920]   they don't see people.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.800]   But they don't see that, you know,
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.120]   Jeff, that you are a wonderful node for information
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.480]   about the future of news.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:36.920]   And if I'm following you and Jeff Rosen and Matthew
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.640]   and four or five others,
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.440]   I'm getting this wonderful feed on the way
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.800]   that's being discussed,
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.240]   that is more than the sum of all the pieces
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.520]   that the institution is doing,
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.560]   because we will become each other's newspaper.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:48.400]   - Right.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.240]   - And that's the thing--
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.080]   - And you're going to what Marshall said,
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.640]   and you start using Wave as a way to curate
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.280]   those people.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.120]   - Right.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:55.960]   - You start to get some--
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.720]   - But then you send that link out on Twitter to say,
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.400]   here's Jeff's summary of where the state is.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.240]   This goes back to the thing that Adina was saying,
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.000]   which is that there's a modality in discussions
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.360]   where you say, I'm summing up the conversation so far,
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.880]   and you do a roundup of it.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.360]   And there isn't a clear way to do that in the Wave world,
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:16.000]   because the Wave is still a sort of tangly thing.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.200]   So if you do that, you end up deleting people's comments
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.680]   rather than, so I suspect who may start a new Wave and say,
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.800]   I've done it over here, you know?
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.560]   And I think bouncing back and forth in these modes
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.960]   is still the hard part.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.640]   And we've got several of these systems
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.240]   that solve small parts of this,
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:34.320]   and they don't fit together, and they may not need to.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.760]   The difference between current state of knowledge
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:39.040]   and breaking news may need to be retained.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:43.480]   But the idea of how the news gets to you
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:46.320]   is something that is changing very rapidly
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.480]   and very strongly.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:50.680]   And what I've seen in the hyper-personalized news discussions
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:53.920]   from the Google folks is they don't seem to see
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.920]   the set of people I follow as a filter
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.440]   as being a strong part of that.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.600]   Now that it may be--
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.040]   - I think part of the reason that they're hot on institutions
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.800]   is because the institutions are blaming them for killing them.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:05.000]   And so you're absolutely right.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.240]   Eric's interviews this week with Danny Sullivan
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.320]   were saying that, oh no, only institutions can support,
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.000]   we have this link on the friend feed,
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.400]   can support major journalism.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.480]   And that's not true when you have people like
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.000]   Josh Marshall out there, but you're right,
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.200]   it's a blind spot.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.680]   But I think the bigger question to me is that you have
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:23.000]   multiple ways to get stuff.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.200]   You have this whole world of search causing most traffic today.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.400]   And then as Marshall was saying,
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.000]   you have this automated aggregation causing traffic.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.200]   And then a stat that I think I gave on our first show
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:37.120]   is that Bitly causes as many links as Google News.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.040]   And so you have human recommendation there.
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:42.160]   And all three become part of a new means of discovery
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.080]   and recommendation.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.120]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.480]   Marshall's running out of power.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:47.560]   He says he has three minutes.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.720]   He's got that little red line on the battery.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.080]   So Marshall, we're gonna let you go.
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.440]   But I thank you so much for being here
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.520]   for the conversation today.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.160]   And I hope you'll come back soon.
[00:59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.000]   - My monkey set up, but I'd love to come back again soon.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.160]   - Good, we'll do it.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.240]   Thank you, Marshall Copactric.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.040]   Readwrightweb.com.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:05.880]   I have to say it slowly.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.200]   It sounds like Elmer Fudd.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.040]   - Thank you, sir.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:09.880]   - I'm very Marshall.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:10.720]   - Take care.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.560]   We're gonna let them go.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:16.200]   - And do look up Marshall's real time web conference
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.360]   that's coming up on October 15.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.240]   - Oh, thank you.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.880]   Forgot the plug.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.120]   - That looks to be really interesting.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.320]   And I'm looking forward to that.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.480]   So the Computer History Museum in San Jose.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.120]   And that's, so it's gonna be curated
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.760]   on conference by Kilea Hamlin.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.040]   And that's a model that's worked really well
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.520]   for internet identity world
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.520]   where a lot of these protocols
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.960]   that were invented in put together.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.920]   So I'm looking forward to that model being used
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.440]   for some of these more less code oriented,
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:44.120]   more how does this stuff work more into discussions?
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.640]   - Are they just fascinating?
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:48.040]   I mean, it's just really a fascinating world.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.600]   We're living in this, changing so rapidly.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.920]   Before we do our tip of the week,
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.320]   our number of the week and my tool of the week,
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.800]   I wanna mention a great tool.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.840]   This is sound right, does it?
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.920]   Go to meeting.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.840]   It's very useful.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.840]   Now talk about real time.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.360]   We're talking about collaboration.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.800]   The whole idea of using the internet
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:13.000]   to eliminate meetings really originated
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.280]   with these folks at Citrix
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.800]   and go to meeting.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.160]   It's an affordable way to meet with your clients
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.440]   and your colleagues.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.320]   If you just add up,
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.080]   I think American Express had a number I saw the other day
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.080]   that said that the average cost of a business trip
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.480]   is about a thousand bucks.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.640]   When you add airfare, hotel, travel, it can be a lot more.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.880]   My trip to Dubai is gonna be costing that times 10, I think.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.880]   And it can be less if it's just driving across town,
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.720]   but the average cost is a thousand bucks.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.000]   That really adds up.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.120]   In fact, that can hit your bottom line pretty darn hard.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.960]   Reduce your profitability.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.360]   Not to mention the amount of stress on you
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.000]   going all over the world to meet people.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.120]   That's why a great way to have these meetings
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.000]   to prepare for presentations as I do or to
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.680]   make sales presentations, to collaborate on documents,
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.600]   to train is go to meeting from the folks at Citrix.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.640]   49 bucks a month,
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.560]   compare that to a thousand dollars a trip.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.800]   And that's unlimited meetings and it includes free,
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.360]   VoIP and phone teleconferencing.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.240]   So you get a great deal for 49 bucks.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.320]   And it's so easy to use and so secure.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.880]   All you gotta do is go to go to meeting.com.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.880]   Actually, you can do it right now.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.240]   You can install it while we're talking.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.920]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.800]   That's our special address.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.800]   You wanna show your support for the Twig program.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.840]   You go to go to meeting.com/twig
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.480]   and sign up today for your go to meeting account.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.240]   Now that's 30 days unlimited use free,
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.360]   as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.840]   Have them with your clients, your colleagues,
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.200]   your show your boss, show everybody in the business
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.520]   and get their sign off.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.120]   Get their approval, make sure that they get it,
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.480]   what you're doing.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.640]   You know, and if one person says,
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.480]   "I don't like it," that's fine.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.360]   But I have a feeling they're all gonna say,
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.600]   "Why aren't we doing this?
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.080]   This is fantastic."
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:56.960]   Once you've got it installed,
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.480]   you start a meeting to use Outlook
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.880]   and send out invitations.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.000]   It has an automatic button.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.640]   It says, you know, start a meeting or send meeting invites.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.560]   Or you can do it by hand.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.000]   You can just go to go to meeting.com,
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.400]   click the start a meeting button.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.240]   You'll get a meeting ID.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.720]   Now give that to everybody on the phone with you.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.000]   Suddenly they're seeing your computer on their desktop.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.320]   They see the PowerPoint.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.960]   You can give them control.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.600]   They can show their computer.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.160]   You can work together simultaneously on a single document.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.240]   It's incredible.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.640]   128-bit SSL encrypted, 24/7.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.440]   Great support.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.080]   I can go on and on, best way to do it.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:30.920]   Just try it.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:34.200]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.760]   Thank you so much for their support of this week in Google.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.880]   Nice to have 'em.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.880]   Okay.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.480]   Let's get ready here for start.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.160]   I guess we'll start with Gina on our tip of the week.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.240]   So this week, my tip is about something
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.320]   that we talked about briefly a couple of weeks ago.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.480]   And that's how to host your own domain email and Gmail.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.720]   There's a Google Apps.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.560]   It used to be called Google Apps for your domain.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.400]   But it's just now, they're just calling it Google Apps now,
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.480]   which is a little confusing.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.520]   But they're just standard edition.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.360]   It's free.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.880]   If you own your own domain name,
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.680]   you know, you at example.com, me@example.com,
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.240]   you can host your email, your email at Gmail,
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.560]   without forwarding and pop-veching
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.360]   and setting or apply to addresses and all that jazz.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360]   Oh, I like that.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.320]   Yeah, it's really nice.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.840]   You can host your email and Gmail.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.240]   And then if you decide at some point, you want out
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.640]   and we talked about this with Matt Cutt a little bit,
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.840]   you change your MX record,
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.840]   you switch to another email hosting provider
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.640]   and you're done, you're good.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.480]   And there's no on behalf of me@gmail.com.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.240]   Anyway, I wrote up the steps on how to do it.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.120]   There's a standard edition,
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.760]   which is free for individuals
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.280]   and for small organizations.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.600]   And then there's the premier and business editions,
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.440]   which you can pay for
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.280]   and you get more space and more services.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.680]   But it's also great if you have a domain name,
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.440]   you know, like myfamily.com
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.800]   and you want to make accounts,
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.520]   you know, mom and my family, dad and my family,
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.360]   you can do that.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.360]   You can create user accounts,
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.000]   you can easily share calendars
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.040]   and Google documents as well on the free edition.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.480]   So the link to how to do that will be in the show notes
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.120]   for people who are interested.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.440]   Or just go to smarterwhere.org.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.280]   Oh, yeah?
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.880]   You've got the good sense to do that.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.760]   You can read it all right there, right?
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.280]   That's the place to go.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.120]   - Thank you, Leo.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.200]   (laughing)
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.400]   - Well, I missed Marshall's plug.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.320]   Thank God, thank God Kevin got that in.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.560]   At least I can do his plug, plug you.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.480]   And now Mr. Jeff Jarvis with his number of the week.
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.320]   - I'll give you the number of the week
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.240]   but I want to mention first,
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.320]   the folks online are demanding to know the story
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.000]   of your tie in your talk to the London News Association
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.800]   and which sock puppet beach you.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.440]   (laughing)
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.280]   - Well for that, you're just going to have to come to Dubai
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.440]   for my 18 minutes of Ted fame.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.160]   - Oh man, Dubai.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.440]   - That's going to be interesting.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.240]   I will not be here next week to do the show.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.440]   Gina and Jeff, we're going to let you do it
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.120]   and we bring in some more people
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.560]   if you want, whatever, however you want to do that.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.440]   But it'll be just like this,
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.960]   except that the ball will be empty.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.560]   There'll just be nobody here.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.400]   Floating mic, just kind of like that.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.960]   But I don't think you really need me.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.520]   I think that you'll do just fine,
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.080]   much better in fact, without me.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.160]   The tie was it? - Goodbye.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.000]   - The tie was it?
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.480]   No, have you?
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.920]   - Just once for a Davos thing
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.400]   and I recommend get the heck out
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:13.080]   of the crazy Disneyland world and go downtown.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:13.920]   - Yes.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.000]   - And it's not really old Dubai,
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.080]   it's really old Pakistan now.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:20.800]   But you don't need real food
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.120]   and take the little water taxis across the water
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.000]   and go to the golds' souq and that kind of stuff.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.720]   It's touristy in its own way, but it's not as--
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.560]   - Bagacy.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.160]   - Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.000]   - As the rest, yeah.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.520]   - No, Jennifer, my wife is going with me
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:35.720]   and she's already said, we're going on a water taxi,
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.800]   we're going to the souks, we're buying gold.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.120]   - Yeah, and you do negotiate.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.480]   I'm so goi-ing that I don't know how to negotiate.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.040]   - I can't do it. - People always
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.000]   have to negotiate it.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.560]   - I cannot do it, I'm so bad.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:50.040]   Yeah, you cut it in half and you start there at best.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:50.880]   You know what's good? - I'm sorry, you're fine.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.200]   - My 15 year old, the tie, Jerry Garcia, no big deal.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.200]   My 15 year old is good at this.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.760]   He went to China with me and he's brilliant.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.600]   He was getting t-shirts for like a buck 50.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.480]   - My kids do like that too.
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.120]   They used to haggling on,
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.920]   which one is it, not Warcraft.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.240]   These hang on like games. - Oh, it's a game.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.040]   - And so you're trading there.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.120]   And a lot of that is about, I have this magic item,
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.960]   I want to sell it for this, I want to put that.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.760]   And so they learn negotiation.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.240]   Christopher learned huge amounts of economics
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.360]   when he was nine just by sitting there
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.040]   playing these games where you have treasure
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.240]   and you've got to try and buy it to it.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.760]   - Fantastic, whoever thought that,
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.040]   what value that would be.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:33.040]   - It was expanding arbitrage to me.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.480]   Now that word, but he said,
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.920]   well, if I go to this world, it's cheaper.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.760]   And so I call that merchanting,
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.560]   I buy it from, and I said, let's call it arbitrage.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.080]   He said, okay, but he was realizing,
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.520]   you know, his stuff was going on.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.720]   - Holy cow, I mean, that's talking about
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.360]   a deep understanding of economics from that.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.280]   Devorack always said his kids were better drivers
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.360]   'cause they did driver games,
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.360]   but this is even better, I think.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.120]   So the tie is Jerry Garcia.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.480]   What was the other question you wanted?
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.680]   - The sock puppet you beat out.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.200]   - I don't know the name of the sock puppet.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:04.200]   We'll never go down in history without an Emmy award.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.000]   - 'Cause I would've guessed it was triumph.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.520]   - No, it was, and it was some crappy sock puppet.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.600]   (laughing)
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.520]   - It wasn't a good sock puppet.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.160]   - Anyway, it's a great number of the way.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.840]   - Thank you, again, for the plug.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.760]   I really appreciate that.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.600]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.440]   - So it was fun.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.280]   - And the great organization, by the way,
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.560]   the online news, or is it association?
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.840]   - Yeah, yes.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:24.680]   - Yeah.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.520]   - And I've got to say I've got to eat crow
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.080]   and I thought that given the economy
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.360]   and given the fact that it was on the way
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.000]   at West Coast, they would have trouble selling
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.160]   because they sold out.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.760]   - Sold out, well, because Ev of Twitter,
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.560]   Ev Williams was the keynote,
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.560]   and they got a great attendance,
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.760]   and there's huge interest in how do we move
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.440]   to this digital age?
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.440]   And it's a great mix of old farts like you and me, Jeff,
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:47.040]   and then young people who are living this,
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.200]   and it's so wonderful to watch everybody share,
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.000]   and it's a great organization.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.720]   If you're in digital media, you should know about it, ONA.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.200]   It's journalist.org.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.040]   - Yes.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.040]   - Number of the week.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.960]   - Number of the week is 80.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.480]   Even as Bing comes out, and even as Yahoo gets
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.400]   this new strategy here,
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:09.080]   Google's share rose according to a stat counter,
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.360]   a web analytics firm, and you know,
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:12.000]   there's a lot of these firms account,
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.360]   but it rose from 77.8% to minus to lead to 80%,
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.640]   and it rose from 90 to 90.54% internationally.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.480]   - Wow.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.600]   - Did Bing fall?
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.600]   Bing, meanwhile, went down from 9.68.5 domestically,
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:31.600]   and Yahoo went down from 10.5 to 9.4 domestically.
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.280]   - Wow.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:35.120]   Wow, very interesting.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.200]   You know, that was the question,
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.440]   was did Bing go up because of the massive ad campaign,
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.640]   and the press attention, and would it recede after time?
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.000]   And there's a lot of neat things on Bing,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.760]   but you know, Google, it's just so automatic now.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.600]   It's almost--
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.480]   - Like Google also added,
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.080]   or this is on the friend feed list,
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.560]   they also added a whole host of new search features
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.360]   this week, so you can limit time
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.480]   and all kinds of stuff like that.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.320]   You can also ask to have fewer shopping references,
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.240]   if you're not really shopping for something,
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.240]   and other things like that.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.560]   And some of these are responses apparently to Bing,
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.080]   but fine, Google just,
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.520]   you're never gonna keep ahead on technology,
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.280]   it's an old, boss mindset.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.720]   - Well, that's a perfect segue, in fact,
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.560]   to my tool of the week,
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.000]   'cause that's exactly what I was gonna talk about,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.680]   these new search options on Google,
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.400]   and I don't know if it has anything to do with us,
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.320]   but Google has added a new feature on their Google blog,
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.040]   at googleblog.blogspot.com,
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.160]   called this week in search.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.600]   Hey, hey, Google, hey!
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.440]   - Ah, hey!
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.600]   - Nice nod.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.160]   - I guess it's a nod.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.760]   It could be a nod, I don't know what it is.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.360]   Anyway, it's actually worth reading.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.640]   Every week they're gonna talk about what's new on Google,
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.000]   and one of the subjects they talk about,
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.520]   these new and exciting features in search.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.960]   This is in some ways too, it's like kind of real time search,
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.160]   because you see they've got now,
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.080]   any time recent results past hour,
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:56.240]   past 24 hours, past week, past year,
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.960]   you can even enter in a date range.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.120]   As you said, you can get fewer shopping results,
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.000]   if you want.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.560]   That's been available,
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.720]   some of these features have been available
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.520]   for a while in Google, go to google.com,
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.560]   and you do a search for this week in what,
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.440]   oh, how about Google,
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.720]   and you'll see this show options feature.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.080]   It's worth checking it,
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.560]   'cause they seem to be adding a lot of nice features,
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.520]   including this fewer shopping sites, more shopping sites,
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.600]   more text, images from the page,
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.600]   and I really like these real time searches.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.160]   I think that's very interesting.
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.640]   I think we mentioned Wonder Wheel before,
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.880]   which I think is kind of cool too,
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.240]   where it's kind of like a mini version of the brain.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.720]   It gives you related searches.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.760]   Oops, and that's smarter word.org, go there too.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.080]   And, I don't know,
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.480]   just a little Jerry Todd action here.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.040]   How there is a smarter word website,
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.760]   you gotta make sure you check that out, okay.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.760]   So-- - Text the mail.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.240]   (laughing)
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.680]   - So, I do unhide those search options.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.920]   They're really, yeah, it is a little bingish, isn't it, Jeff?
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.080]   Come to think of it.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:03.920]   It is-- - No, man.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.160]   - That sidebar down there is starting to look
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.080]   more and more bing-like,
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.000]   although bing doesn't allow you to do fewer shopping sites.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.360]   That's Google only.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.520]   - Hey, great to have you on once again, Kevin Marks.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.560]   It's always a pleasure. - It's amazing.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.880]   - Not only because of your great English accent,
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.200]   but because of your knowledge in the business
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.000]   and your association with Google in the past
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.480]   and the great stuff you're doing at British Telecom,
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:31.480]   don't forget ribbit.com/wave if you're on wave,
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.160]   and you want to add the conference link to that.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.240]   I'm sorry, did you have anything you want to say?
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.920]   - All right, also there's a link from there
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.320]   to the Ribbit API spec.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.120]   So Jeana wants to have a look at that.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.880]   I'd love to hear her responses.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.360]   - Cool, so there's an API, that'd be great.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.240]   - Yeah, I'll check it out.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.960]   - I could build that into my World of Warcraft bargaining.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.360]   (laughing)
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.360]   Do some arbitrage with Ribbit.
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.960]   - Okay, I got my son to help you with that.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:57.800]   (laughing)
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.000]   - Yeah, think of my Nina's help.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.320]   Jeana Trapani is at smarterware.org,
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.880]   and it's just great to have you, Jeana.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.640]   You were, Jeana was wonderful on Mac Break Weekly last week
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.720]   if you haven't heard the Jeana Trapani Merlin Man episode.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.720]   You should go back and listen to that.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.640]   - Thank you, thanks, have me, always fun.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.480]   - Great to have you, always.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.320]   The bikes are multiplying.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.000]   We'll see if next week we've got three on the wall.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:17.840]   (laughing)
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:18.720]   - I'll work on that.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.680]   - Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachined.com
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.520]   and a great fella to know when you want to know
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:27.680]   about what's happening in news and the future of journalism
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.480]   and of course, all of this stuff that's happening
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.320]   on the web.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.160]   Great to have all three of you.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.040]   Thank you for being here.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.880]   We thank you for watching the show.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.280]   I know we gave out and have given out several times
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.280]   the number to call and we have like 7,000 voicemail messages.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.080]   Maybe next episode we just won't do any stories at all.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.160]   We'll just do voicemail messages.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.160]   We just seem to always run out of time.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.200]   But thank you for your calls.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.040]   They're great.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.520]   And if you do have some listener feedback,
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.800]   97, 95, Twig VM is the phone number.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.920]   That's 979-589-4486, our Google Voice number.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.840]   You can leave a message there.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.080]   We will get some in next week.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.080]   I promise you, we just run out of time
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.440]   every single time.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.600]   We didn't even cover all the stories.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.520]   Just one, it was Google Wave today.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.760]   You can watch the show live.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.160]   We do a 215 Pacific 515 Eastern time
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.840]   every Saturday afternoon at live.twit.tv.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.720]   And of course, you must subscribe

[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.760]   whether it's iTunes or Zoom or whatever it is you use.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.600]   Thanks for watching.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.000]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.200]   Thanks for listening, I should say.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:35.360]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.520]   (upbeat music)
