[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.240]   Matthew there are people listening who don't know that you're waving so on that when you do say I have to then say
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.480]   Matthew Ingram is now waving his hand
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.560]   No nodding waving
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.920]   In from Davos from the world economic forum
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.600]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis with his Android beanie
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.640]   Did they give you that?
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.440]   No, I bought it in the Google store
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.640]   How much? Oh, I need that ball body right hold weather gear. I really want that I want that that is awesome
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.920]   The greatest thing and it's really really good. You look like an insane person
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.760]   What's worse coming over the headset?
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:36.360]   Well, I'm I can you get that online. I'm ordering it right now. That's awesome. I'm pink and green
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.920]   I went into the store and bought it but was my daughter for Christmas. It's awesome. Oh
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.160]   I bet she the she's Android
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160]   No, but
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.040]   Well, maybe this would be the first step to convert her. You know the play store
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.880]   They have music books magazines movie and TV Android apps and devices, but no swag. They need a swag
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.820]   They do they really use swag maybe it's swag section. They just shop
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.980]   We'll strike store. Oh, should I search for Google swag store? I
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.260]   Believe he's talking about anti Google can't yeah, he was at the plex. He was at the campus. I don't want to drive to my
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.600]   They also say stuff. I don't know if they say that or not
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.060]   But they also say stuff. I'll guess what Google store calm
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yeah
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.800]   Also, jina jina jina jina tina trapani
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.320]   and jina Jarvis you both sound like ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji pani of smarter where.com
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.080]   And what and the in the Google Store. They obviously have a server in the basement
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   Somewhere in some closet because it's not moving very fast. Oh
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.580]   My gosh is that slow?
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.940]   Yeah
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.220]   Click on your location you think this is real says copyright
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.920]   From them. Yes, it's an ASPx file. We are currently down for maintenance and it's got a lava lamp
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.300]   I think this is you're broken. I think this is bad broken
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.620]   Sign everybody's gone there to buy the hat. It's an ASPx file. Not sure that I
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.500]   Think Google would not use a Microsoft Techno. No eight no way you have a Google online store
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.140]   Whether you found it or not through Google or not. I don't know but I
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:22.620]   Did in fact that just shows you what the Department of Justice has contended that Google does not favor its own places
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.540]   Because Google online store is number one in the search results
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.700]   Google Store home number two down for maintenance will be up shortly
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.540]   You just take down Google Store
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.660]   Everybody went to buy this stupid hat good work. Nice job
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.140]   No, it's a great hat
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.700]   So Google's to to Wall Street you got our cue for numbers wrong
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:05:01.300]   Their analysts estimates were too high so Google told everybody a few days ago. Hey, you know
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.980]   It don't get your hopes up. It ain't gonna be that good and the reason was it's an accounting thing actually
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:15.060]   Because the analysts included Motorola home in the estimates and Google has announced today
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.260]   That they are not gonna include that in the results because they sold it in December. Do we know they sold it or is that an is that?
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.460]   News yeah, we did we did we do okay, we knew
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.740]   Google did all right not as well as Apple
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.700]   But they they did $8.62 a share in the fourth quarter
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.500]   2.89 billion dollars in
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:47.900]   In is that revenue or profit? No, that's in profit compared to 2.71 billion in profit in the year-to-date a year ago
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.620]   but that
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.500]   That's on revenue of 11.34 billion dollars. So that that's you know
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.460]   They don't have the same revenue and they don't have the same profit and they don't have the same profit margin as Apple
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.580]   shares up 5% in after hours trading to
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.740]   $736 at 40 cents
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.580]   But you can see they were trying to avoid what we were just talking about with Apple you missed by even a little right
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.820]   You know the street penalizes you because they had
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.260]   Ex estimates so they were guiding them that's smart. I don't know how legal it is, but it's smart
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.180]   Happens all the time. I guess you have to
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:33.980]   Or you want to yeah, Apple had a great quarter the record revenue record profits and and after hours trading of the stock is down considerably
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.940]   Because it has kudos they missed their the analyst estimate by a couple hundred million
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.780]   You know what they say buy on rumor sell-on-fact, right?
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.460]   Chatham also contends it has something to do with the Apple's advisement for the next quarter that it's
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.700]   Disappointings in some obscure way to Wall Street. I
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.980]   Know it's not really news is it when this I
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.660]   It's just Wall Street
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:07.700]   Google's making money, right? That's good news any surprises in their in their results of quarterly results
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.380]   Not that I saw all right
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.860]   So we'll move on then
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.140]   Anything to learn from the quarterly results you guys have parsed it. I suppose
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.620]   Analyze I was busy reading football for dummies. I don't have any idea what happened
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.100]   That's sort of less interested in the numbers. I'm interested in what Larry's kind of speech
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.100]   You know and it sounds like there's nothing really hugely new there
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.460]   Sounds like still focus and pairing things down or or what you know
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.740]   What what's important to him and he did a whole bit about how Google is or the biggest asset
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:48.020]   We actually there's another story in the rundown about why Google's such a great place to work and fortune might named it best place to work
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.380]   In the US for like the fourth year in a row
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:08:00.980]   But other than that nothing too surprising John Schwartz in the USA today does point out one thing that could be a cost for concern the
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.660]   Click Rev click price
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.140]   Cost per click dipped 6% and has it now its fifth straight?
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:16.700]   Fall and cost per click prices. That's of course how Google makes money and for the most part is through ad clicks
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.820]   So their ads aren't as valuable as they used to be
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:26.460]   And that's the same with everybody that's because of mobile right web ads. Yeah, yeah
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.380]   It's mobile. I think it's also
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:36.460]   Social versus search. It's also just the declining ad prices going across new
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:42.540]   Live exchanges a lot our competition we charge more here at Twitt. So there
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.500]   Mm-hmm. I'm somebody got a screenshot of
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:58.580]   Did you see Sergey Brin by the way on the subway who got that picture? That's a great picture
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:05.060]   I love that story. It's like dudes is getting on a downtrend train and it's time square and notices somebody wearing Google glasses
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.060]   And oh it happens to be
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.220]   Founder of Google. Yeah, yeah
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.220]   It's a great photo. I love that he's taking I love that he takes a subway
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:20.300]   I do too. He dresses down for the subways not wearing his normal James Bond tuxedo, but you can tell it's him
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.100]   He's wearing a watch cap. Can you see that chat?
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:29.940]   It looked like a cat burglar. He does. He looks like he just he's got a bag of stuff that he took from somebody's house
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.340]   He's wearing a watch cap
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:38.380]   You know kind of a zip up a jacket not a hoodie more like a turtleneck and
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:45.100]   Some very interesting glasses if it wasn't for the glasses, I wouldn't have looked twice
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.420]   Yeah, I wouldn't look twice out of me there
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.060]   But I love that the person who wrote that blog post was you know
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.500]   Recognize that he was wearing the glasses and then was like is that's your game like asked to take a picture and actually had a
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.380]   Talk with him about it. Oh, so he actually asked yeah cuz sir gets looking right at him. Yeah, his wife
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.980]   His wife is looking away. She doesn't want to be recognized, but the sir. He's there. See she's pretending. She doesn't know him
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.980]   Is
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:15.620]   Sorry, that's just me. That's a great time. I'm like pink plaid to me says
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.380]   loaded
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.740]   I'm sorry. I am such a not a man of the people
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:30.100]   Yeah, he asked us or if he could take a picture of him and and so gay smiled and said yes
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.900]   And then he chatted him up about it and then he this guy
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.940]   I think his name is Noah Noah's zirkin Noah's
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.500]   Yeah, I blogged about it, but said that he some some of the things they talked about he wants to keep off the record
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.380]   Yeah
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.180]   It was just so you know the downtown number three expressed train from Times Square
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:51.620]   He was he
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:59.220]   He says this guy obviously what is he a program or something he says I mean I've encountered a number of people wearing Google Glass Wow
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.740]   Yeah, this person is in the know
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.580]   Well, I never have
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.700]   That's a train all time and associate is actually never really
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.340]   So it looked up and there was a fellow wearing a glass unit cool
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.020]   I've been to Google NYC for a tech talk and I see Google is on the subway periodically
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.820]   It wasn't that much of a surprise, but boy that guy sure looks a lot like Sergey Brin
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.620]   I asked if I could take his picture he smiled and could set it
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.460]   I asked how the project was coming along how he liked where it was right now of course
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.180]   He told me that he loved it coming along really well
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.620]   Somehow though, I didn't trust my own eyes enough to believe it was really Sergey sitting across from me
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.300]   I mean I've seen the dude's private jetliner with my own eyes while working out in NASA Ames
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:48.500]   What would he be doing on the subway? He's true. He has his own jet many not one more than one private jet I
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.780]   Asked if he was part of the core ex team and he said yes, I am
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.420]   He told me there are about a hundred other people outside of ex who have prototype devices
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.580]   I told him I was a music developer and was looking forward to getting a dev unit
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.340]   And will you hire me? Will you hire me? Yeah, really? Yeah
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:17.100]   Wow, I want to know if you were in the five round five fingers shoes
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:23.940]   Does he wear those? Yeah, those weird those weird shoes that look like a foot. Yeah, the five fingers fingers shoes
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.540]   He wears them all the time. That's what I thought
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.300]   So, you know, he he really is an eccentric millionaire billionaire. I
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.140]   Like that he rides a subway god bless him
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.740]   Love that
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.260]   Why not the subway's the fastest way to get around New York?
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.660]   right
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:48.140]   Yeah, Jeff doesn't work too well to get downtown from Times Square. Yeah, I'm a cab can get stuck in traffic
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.220]   Even a black car can get stuck in traffic
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:57.100]   All right, we're gonna take a break. I guess we lost Davos, so we're gonna get Jeff look sees
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.820]   And we'll pick out the power
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:08.100]   Jeff Jeff Jarvis is at the and I'm gonna ask about this world economic forum in Davos, Switzerland and his roomy is
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.780]   Bill gross of ideal lab

[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.500]   Matthew Ingram Gina Trapani Jeff Jarvis talking about
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.580]   Google what did he say?
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.380]   anything of great interest
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.500]   Gina in the conference call
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.060]   Do you reveal anything?
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.500]   You know he was the typical CEO thing where he talked about all of Google's, you know
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.100]   Successes over the past year. He talked about knowledge graph. He talked about
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:03.060]   Chrome and he talked about focus right about Google has to pick the products
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.340]   They really have to focus on and he also and I really like this
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:11.580]   He talked about sort of how we're all living this like multi-screen life right now and that this is kind of uncharted territory
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:17.340]   I think he called it how we all have a phone and a tablet and a laptop and I assume he didn't say this
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.980]   But I assume it you know we're all gonna have glasses soon too, right?
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:26.220]   And we have to make experiences that are that that that sink across those things and and that work well
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.820]   It's sort of the multi the multi-screen life. He talked about it's a multi-screen life for us
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.860]   multi-screen life for us
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:41.020]   He talked about how there's a lot of room for innovation with these screens like how that you know we drop our phones
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.020]   They shouldn't crack in half and
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:50.220]   A lot easier to have these small devices, you know, they're all working walking around with super computers in our pockets and there are a lot of
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:57.780]   innovations opportunities in that and absolutely agree right mobiles mobiles a big thing wasn't anything too
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:07.060]   Crazy talk almost. Yeah, I mean that was it. That's his job. Isn't it right to talk about how great the past year was
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.900]   A lot cheerleading cheerleader. Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, although I think the analysts are pretty smart
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.540]   I would think that they would want to hear open and frank
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.540]   Conversations about challenges and things like that, right?
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.700]   Yeah, I mean he's no
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:28.500]   They don't want to be said biggest challenge is focus right that Google has to put its energies in the right places
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:35.580]   And then how do we agree with that right? That's been a big message more wood behind fewer arrows
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.420]   focusing pairing down
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:43.860]   Yep, he did say that they have some supply chain issues that they have to work out
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.140]   The Nexus and he was referring to that the Nexus line how it's impossible to get
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.660]   the Nexus for or the Nexus 10 at this point and
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.620]   So that was that was a little bit of an admission
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.020]   Clearly there's work to be done managing our supply better as well
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.900]   Yeah, I'm building a great customer experience and that is a priority for the team. So okay. Good to hear that
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.780]   Yeah, I mean that's that's kind of the real issues
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.140]   Is they underestimate and by the way LG said it's not our fault. It's Google's fault
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.860]   They told us how many to make each other in a way pardon me
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:20.020]   They both seem to be blaming each other. I mean Google seems to be saying it's LG LG's saying it's Google
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.100]   I guess that always happens well
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:29.540]   I would think that LG has the capacity to manufacture enough Nexus 4's that it really comes down to
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:35.060]   What it's Google say? Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.620]   right
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.620]   Maybe they just underestimated
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.820]   That's what happened is Google. I mean you it's it you can't blame him
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:49.620]   That's it there this is not their business hardware is not their business and it's definitely better to underestimate than over yeah
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.620]   You don't want to make too many
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.620]   This is what this is what he said about the multi-screen opportunities
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.900]   He said think about your device battery life is a huge issue
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.900]   He shouldn't have to worry about constantly recharging your phone when you drop your phone. It shouldn't go splat
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:06.140]   Everything should be a ton faster and easier. There's real potential than new and better experiences
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:12.780]   So he might be talking about glass there. Maybe just talking about you know Motorola and what maybe they can do there
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.300]   We were talking about all about Android all about Android yesterday
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:23.580]   The rumors about the Motorola Google the Google roll a X phone that may be I don't know the Google I/O giveaway this year
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.580]   That'll be interesting
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.700]   But yeah, the rest of this just really did kind of seem like cheerleading
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.500]   Nothing nothing really new
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.340]   Interesting though when you it sounds like he's taking a little bit of a pot shot at Apple
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:41.580]   When he says about the breaking although Android phones break too, but it sounds like he's really aiming it at Apple
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.340]   I don't know why he would even need to do that
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.820]   I don't know. I mean I
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:53.100]   Buy double batteries for my Android phones. Yeah, that's that's what the chief advantages, isn't it?
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.540]   Yeah, yeah
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.980]   But the fact is that you know as nerds were like well we can change out the battery
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:03.340]   But you know his point is like you shouldn't have to recharge you know recharging shouldn't be such a such a pain to begin with you know
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.740]   Um, it's a stopgap solution just having a second battery right
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.820]   Hmm
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.740]   We're still trying to get Jeff back. I blame bill gross
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:24.860]   Did you see that before we started Jeff showed us the pile over bar wow wires? It was not did not look sensible
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.820]   Didn't look safe. I'll tell you what let's get the trumpets out while we're getting Jeff
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.060]   We'll place in trumpets and we'll do the google change law
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.420]   the google change log
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:44.860]   No from google this week jina trapani has the change log
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.540]   A small handful of little minor things this week
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.220]   first google slides which is uh google drives
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:21:00.060]   Presentation powerpoint slide deck tool that go that's going offline. That's gonna be available for offline use and google sheets to follow
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.300]   They're rolling this functionality out
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:07.420]   This week and basically you just have to install the offline chrome app into your chrome browser
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.860]   If you're using chrome if you're on chrome OS it works for you automatically
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.420]   You're just using chrome in your desktop you install the offline drive chrome app and you'll have slides offline
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.540]   That's awesome
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.700]   That's that's nice for when you're on the plane and freaking out because you've got your presentation in as an hour
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.020]   And you got to make a last minute change to your slide deck
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:28.700]   Chrome is getting search encryption for not signed in users
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.500]   So right now if you're signed into chrome and you do a google search from the omnibox
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:40.220]   That that request is made over ssl. That means that your your information your referrer information isn't sent to the to the website
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:46.140]   Now from chrome chrome 25 on if you're not signed in same thing everything is ssl by default
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.940]   Yeah, which is which is which is really nice and actually I would love to hear what jeff how what jeff thinks about that referrer
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:58.220]   Information not getting sent along to publishers because that does affect publishers and their ability to kind of
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:02.460]   But what what drove people to their content? What do you hear jeff? What do you think?
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.420]   I'm back. I think it really does affect it
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.940]   I you know I was talking to somebody from google today i've been talking to some publishers
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:14.780]   I think the exchange of value that should occur with google is about data about the readers who come to them
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:21.580]   And uh if there's something shut it off it cuts off in other part of the negotiations that we'll see later in the in the list
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.140]   means that um
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:28.380]   Google's kind of trapped in dealing with publishers in europe
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.980]   By the way, I just bought three of those beanies
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.860]   Oh, it's weird because
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.740]   They come from the uk though. I'm never gonna get them
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:43.180]   Oh, no, you've did find them. Yeah, they come from the uk on this google store
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.060]   Wait a minute. Where'd you find them? Uh, I think it's the same store. It's the uk
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.860]   Yeah, yeah, because it's it says down there in the bottom
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.860]   Is europe's and dollars
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:58.860]   Can you buy us a few jeff and bring him over? I bought three so uh, I could send one to you matthew and one to jina
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.540]   Perfect. Oh jeff already got his oh, I guess it's because he's where he's located
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:08.220]   Because he's in euro. Yeah, he's in europe. Just backing pack. Oh, he got it. He went to mountain view
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.100]   He got it. I was a mountain view
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:16.140]   Oh, I got stocking stuffers for christmas for the kids and this for me
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.860]   Nice brand edition limited that sells these things so I don't know what the hell
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:26.940]   I'm never gonna. Does it look like mine? Yeah, it's yours. Did you? It's the same one
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:32.300]   There it is. That looks like yours doesn't it? It's got the eyes
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.740]   How come sir? Yeah, it wasn't wearing one. Yeah, now that's how you get anonymous on a train
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.060]   Yeah, that'll be really anonymous
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.820]   I think it's a good way to get a seat people kind of move over when you're coming
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.220]   Ooh boy
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.940]   Anyway continue on change law and continue part two
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.620]   News uh google maps street view now includes israel
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.980]   So all lots of new pictures of israel and I would list all the cities where there are pictures available
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.380]   But I don't want to I don't want to totally mangle the names
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.620]   Uh, but uh go over to israel and google maps and check out street view lots of new imagery there
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:11.100]   And finally google's integrating google plus profiles into its company jobs board

[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.420]   nerd nest
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.940]   See I didn't get that bar and I am signed in maybe you have to use uh
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.380]   Chrome, maybe let me try it. Maybe it's in chrome
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:32.220]   If it didn't yeah, you just went to jot jobs at google.com and yeah, it says uh, it should say just a normal thing
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:41.260]   No, no bar. Maybe it knows. I'm not really looking for work. Well search so you get that doesn't want you search jobs. Okay. Let's see boss
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.660]   Connect the search results. Let's see
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.460]   teacher chief co-veter
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.820]   Um, oh they they might have some listings here
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.020]   None of our openings match boss. Oh here it is
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:01.020]   Enable google plus hi there. Okay, so you had to search for something first. Okay. Yeah, I got it too
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.860]   Now now I'm now and now will it recommend a job for me?
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:11.900]   Yeah, I mean if you're a willy if you just go to jobs, uh, the jobs tab it should tailor listings for you
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.500]   You can also um
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:19.020]   narrow the job listings by location. So I think the defaults are like mountain view san francisco, new york
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:24.540]   East on your educational criteria. We believe you could work in the back room sweeping up
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:32.460]   I like this at the bottom at google. We we don't just accept difference. We celebrate it. We support it
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:37.100]   We thrive on it. That's that now that's an employment policy
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:41.180]   I like that for the benefit of our employees. Our products are you leo
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:47.900]   Maybe that's because I signed in. Oh, you're different knows your difference. You're a white man
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:53.660]   And elderly white man. Well, I don't think we have any of those at google
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.860]   We'd love to have you give us some diversity
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.940]   Yeah
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.660]   I heard there's a new server to google

[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.540]   Yeah
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.540]   My
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.900]   I gotta look it up
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.940]   Dandel to move a baby or young child up and down in a playful or affectionate way
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.940]   There you go
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:10.780]   Move something lightly up and down dandling the halter rope. He gently urged the ponies head up
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.260]   so
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:20.220]   So I will dandel your child upon my knee dandel. Thank you this weekend grammar
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.100]   dandel
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:27.820]   This is something uh, this is good. This is I just searched for dandel on google and I got this new thing
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.140]   Yeah, the one box defined is really nice
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.820]   That's right. The pronunciation even has the audio and dandel
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.980]   We talked about this last night on all about android and google now if you do define dandel
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:43.180]   It'll it'll do it'll define it for you as well. So you have to read you have to use the word define, huh?
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:50.060]   Okay, I guess dandel was so obscure that now see somebody call me and said you don't pronounce niche
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.980]   niche you pronounce it niche niche
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.700]   Thank you
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:03.580]   Niches froggy. I think only fancy people say niche. It's it's like saying schedule
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.220]   Okay, try life-sto the shuttrex
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:12.700]   You try likes I don't even add a spell it little unsaid
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.180]   Try gigabyte. Are you done?
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.340]   Are you done with the changelog? That is the changelog play the
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:24.940]   Whatever it is. Thank you Chad
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:35.260]   Favorite part of the show. I love the changelog. This was a great idea. Was it your idea or a listener's idea?
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.980]   It was a list it was a listener's idea, but it was such a good idea
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.780]   I'm not good at coming up with good ideas, but I'm gonna recognize in that so yeah, but with it
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:50.940]   I got an old a very old show. Let me let me jump ahead to the show
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:59.660]   Well, I played with by the way with a Vizio co-star, which is one of the new google TVs
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.380]   uh, and uh
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.380]   It's okay. It's
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.460]   You know they biggest problem they have is the networks and hulu blocking them
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.820]   If you can't do those those watch those shows, I don't get the point of it
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:19.740]   So I I liked the Vizio co-star. That was nice. It was a niceest google TV out there, but not the best
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.260]   Uh, you are you still looking for a number jeff?
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.860]   Yeah, I am. How about the one billion dollar
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.220]   headquarters in london google's planning to build
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.420]   Well now you just gave it to me and blew it in one breath
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.740]   But I give it if I can't handle away
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.700]   um
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:47.660]   There's a picture of it. Oh no here it comes. Oh my god. I guess the ft's behind a paywall
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.060]   ft just gave me the like
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.900]   You're a cookie policy. Yeah, how would you like to give us some money?
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.460]   Before you read this article
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.420]   The two different things the cookie policy is you okay?
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:04.060]   You EU regulation requiring you to sign off that it's okay to have these evil things
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.820]   What called cookies said at you the paywall is a different matter
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.820]   So I'm agreeing that the they're they're allowed to see the
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:17.660]   Pieces of text that a browser puts on your hard drive at every website shocking shocking
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.140]   Um consenting to the act of browsing my website
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:26.460]   You are leaking information, but uh, this is what happens. This is what happens if you don't pay the paywall
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.420]   Yeah, I get a flesh colored box
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:35.420]   Oh, you must have reached the limit because I was able to oh really there's a limit that they're doing that thing like the times does
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:40.140]   It's telling me if you've registered you have to actually register. Oh, I'm not registered
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:45.340]   I have another so that's what I get. So thank you financial times for that useless article
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:50.540]   Oh
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:55.420]   We were talking a little bit about this on the security now google has declared war on the password
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.460]   Oh, what did steep have to say about this? This is kind of interesting
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.980]   He's excited because one of the devices
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:06.940]   Uh that they're talking about that they're testing is something that he has been a fan of and
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.620]   Over a long time the ubico ub key have you seen that?
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:15.980]   I have not played with it myself, but yeah, I've kind of I've heard about this
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:20.300]   We've had stina the design the founder of a ubico on the show several times
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:25.260]   It's a little usb device now the current ubiki is that's about the size of it is the image
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.260]   I'm showing right now the current ubiki
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:36.140]   Is is a very odd device because when you plug it into the usb port it doesn't it appears as a keyboard because all computers understand keyboards
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.380]   And it types a long
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:45.260]   Password like really long like I don't know. Oh, so wow, I know it's very odd. So if you if you have a
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:50.780]   Text editor up you'll actually just type your password in the clear. That's not what you want
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:58.140]   That's not what they're talking about with the the google idea, but the google idea is there would be a redesigned ubico that chrome
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:04.780]   Would be aware of and it could be this on a keychain. It could be a literally could be a ring
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.100]   They're talking about a ring on your finger
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.740]   and um
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.140]   Then if you're using this new chrome
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.740]   That's all you need and it's kind of a frictionless login
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.180]   I really like this idea of an object being the thing that lets me in, you know, like the
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.980]   Like the two step off, you know, you having your well
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:31.020]   I'd still want it to be two step, right? You still want a password because otherwise somebody steals your ring you're you know, right? Yeah, right
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:36.620]   Right exactly right because the concept of a key like your car key is useless to someone if they don't know which car is yours
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.340]   Right, but if everyone has a google chrome ring
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:44.140]   Uh, right. You just have to pick up steal someone's and plug it in. You know what it is, right?
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:49.580]   Right, but the thing I like about the phone is, you know, I always have my phone. Yeah, I like the google
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:54.620]   Yeah, you know, they need to send me a code. They just send it to the phone. Right
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.900]   Uh google google is uh, it is not a one-time password
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.860]   S.J. F and in the chat room. It is a the same one each time you plug it in
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:08.700]   There's no there's no smarts in the ubico. It's it's
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.540]   plumb
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.980]   That's it
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:17.660]   However, um, the authenticator is a one-time password. I think that's a good solution for second effect or authentication
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.500]   But as we know the google two-step authentication only
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.340]   The authenticator only works when you're logging into google
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:30.860]   If you're giving others access to your google account, you have to use a much less secure generated
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.580]   uh second step password
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.260]   Yeah, why why not i scans or fingerprints?
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.820]   Uh, how come that's never really expensive too expensive? Yeah
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.180]   They're expensive to do to do well anyway. I mean we have had fingerprints for a long time, but they're pretty it's pretty bad
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:52.380]   Yeah, well if I always figure that it's guy. I can't imagine it's not gonna screw up
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:58.620]   You know misread the figure. Well, look at every time you get a barcode that misreads or a QR code that misread the fingerprints a complicated finger read
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:04.540]   I i'm sorry the ubiki does in fact do one time, uh, as well as a fixed password
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:11.500]   So uh, I just be afraid of losing it. I mean a tiny little dongle. I was just talking about their fit bit
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.980]   And how they've bought three of them because they keep losing them because they're so small right
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.940]   These are really small
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:24.540]   Yeah, my fitbit just disintegrated last week. I was I was so proud that I had it for so long and
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:29.260]   The fitbit is tough because it's kind of all you guys
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:34.620]   Yeah, it's so small. That's why you'll see security jewelry, right? You'll see security jewelry
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.420]   We'll have obvious stories
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:43.740]   In fear cut off or a neck or or you where is necklace could the ring use I guess the ring could use nfc
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.100]   Yeah
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:54.220]   The nice hotel where bill gross state and munich
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:58.700]   Uh, my room here. Uh, those of you who are on the show now don't understand boss play later
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.100]   um
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:08.780]   The it's an nfc key room key that also gets you the elevator against everything else with cool. He he walked a
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:13.580]   Way with it that's to send it back, but we won't tell them
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:19.580]   He walked away with your bandwidth to just took it out right out of the room. Yeah, I know
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:27.740]   Uh, he's got the key you know, just get the key. Well, I just won't move this time because it'll take the the the image will get all confused
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:36.140]   Well, what if you had you know, we just mentioned fitbits. What if you had what if nikey fuel band had the ability to log you in the thanks go chunk
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.180]   Yeah
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:44.860]   I think that's where we need to go. I do think it has to be two factor though. I think it shouldn't be just that's the whole thing
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.820]   What's that what's that you're showing us?
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:53.340]   That's the key for the bi-arisher. Hough. Oh wow that that built roast deck
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:59.020]   He stole but it's nfc it's nfc. Well those are cheap to replace
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:04.540]   Both both google with its authenticator and facebook now have
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:10.700]   Facebook's app has a built-in authenticator blizzard uses unauthenticator. I guess I think these are getting more and more common
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:16.140]   Um, I wish everybody just used google last pass uses google's authenticator as long as well as google
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.940]   So I just run that on my phone and it gives me a one-time key
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.740]   I love that
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:27.340]   But you'd have the same problem you have with two-step authentication that only google products would be you know key aware
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:32.860]   Yeah, so you'd still have to you know, there's still be that whole and by the way
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:37.980]   You know, they always use matt honan as the example, but he got hacked by social engineering
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:43.420]   Right it was social hacking you could he could have the best password and all two-step authentication he wanted
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.420]   But he just called apple and said I don't know my password and they said well, let's send you a new one
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:52.300]   I guess if he had two step that would if apple had two step that would have worked
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:57.500]   Except that you could always on all of these you could say oh, I lost my key too
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:04.140]   Well, it's yeah, that was that at the time I don't know it was apple or amazon that the that the bug or the problem was with
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.540]   It started with it was both was apple
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:11.980]   What was both because they went to amazon first thing they do is a who is to get your docs right now?
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.820]   They have your address
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:18.780]   So then they go to amazon and they add a new credit card, which you don't have to do any verification to do
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:24.060]   And by doing so and it doesn't have to even be a real credit card get they get the last four digits of your credit card
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:30.940]   And your address now and by the way, these holes have supposedly been patched now and by the way, it's no passwords yet
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:35.340]   Now they go to apple and say I forgot the security questions
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:40.540]   But here's the last four digits of my credit card and my street address and apple said oh no problem
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.100]   We'll just reset your password there for you right?
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:50.300]   I mean that was a question of what secondary information do you use to verify somebody when they've forgotten their password right two different companies use two different
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:56.540]   That was that was awful. Well go amazon didn't use anything. They just you just added pat pat you they don't even verify
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:01.820]   Is it good you want to add another credit card? We're glad to take it right? They're like right we'll take your payment right exactly
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:06.460]   It's really apples the hole was at apple and they say they're not doing that anymore
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.340]   So I believe them
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.500]   Uh
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.020]   1998 this is somebody just sent me a link in the chat room. I love this
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:21.340]   Uh, this is from the java one conference in 1998 a java ring
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:30.060]   That contained an i button chip with a java virtual machine that could act as a token for access control e-cash
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.060]   Data logging
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.500]   This is from nine
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.940]   This is from 1998 the 14 years ago. They had this
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:41.580]   That's cool. So I guess this is there's nothing new under this sun
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:45.740]   Yeah, there's nothing. No, right? What's it gonna take for people to actually start using something?
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:51.020]   Pass or that's the question. It's it's java your fingers gonna fall off. I know
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:55.660]   Last thing you want nowadays here look as an exploit on my finger

[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.340]   Then we'll talk about mega
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.860]   In case I go away. All right. So for the Davos report I needed to do this of course since
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:47.260]   For the red Davos hat I wear that
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.260]   Can't wait to give my hat
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:55.660]   I have my my Davos badge here the official Davos bad, but I shouldn't the video because it messes the band with up
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:45:00.220]   Uh, I'll stop moving now. It's I've been here since
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:06.060]   Uh, when we were here yesterday last night went to the tech pioneers dinner
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:10.940]   Which is an amazing thing to go to because they really do bring in technology pioneers people who are growing
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:17.420]   Leafy green vegetables in car sized warehouses with no light and hardly any water
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.060]   Uh, people who are putting flexible
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:24.860]   Chips into things that uh, affect your heart
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:29.020]   Uh, people who just are doing amazing things all around
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.900]   And so that's what Davos does is brings those people in
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:37.660]   Um today I had uh, I added two events. So I don't really have a lot to report here. I think that um
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.140]   I went to a
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.980]   Social session this morning where I'll take the hat off now. Um
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.020]   Where
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.580]   You know what was interested me was we had people from
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.620]   uh excel and
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:57.420]   MIT and a chinese journalist and uh oce heedy
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.980]   And there was a lot of talk about about the internet not just disrupting business
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:07.580]   But now disrupting truly government and and that surprised me to come at this point from from here, but it worked
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:13.740]   Uh, I think it's an important discussion to have. I think there's a realization now that that as somebody said
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.940]   We were renegotiating the social contract with government as somebody else said
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.380]   Data allows the citizens to um
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:26.700]   Go around politicians because citizens know more often than government does and that's highly disruptive to government
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.660]   So that was all very interesting. That's kind of a Davosian discussion
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:34.380]   And the other news here is there is no google party this year
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.220]   And no like cell wine party a cell wine party to start with that one
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.860]   Was incredible
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:46.220]   They they brought they flew in salalliers and unbelievable cases of unbelievable wines
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.660]   And I managed to sneak into the damn thing twice, but um
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.300]   Joe shorndorff
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:58.780]   Uh said today that uh that they did kind of look at the list at the end of the night and they saw 400 people there and 300 people
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.780]   They didn't even know who managed to get invitations
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:06.140]   Uh, but the other truth is that the role economic form is trying to make things look a little less
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:10.300]   Um, it's a little elitist. Yeah. Yeah, so uh
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.580]   The google gave up its party
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:17.340]   Reports that I believe have it that they were not pressured
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.820]   But they were suggested that they really should stop giving the party
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:24.060]   And google I think was flying with that because it was a major thing all the parties are the same
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.260]   They're just very loud with you know sprockets playing and all that
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.900]   Um, so that's going on yahoo
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:34.300]   However, marissa mire is down here for the first time. She's she's a denizen of of davos
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.940]   But she's here for the first time for yahoo and she is instead going to have a party so marissa mire
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.260]   Reports have it is taking over
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.780]   Uh, the party beat
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.940]   Meanwhile, they always had on saturday night this big gala where you're supposed to wear black title like I said
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.380]   That's dead now people are going to go up and eat brunch on this on the snow
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.140]   Um
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:58.380]   It's pretty much the same thing it always is it's the makhers the world coming here that bankers are are unapologetic for how they've screwed up
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:04.300]   The world as always and they're out there saying that we have um david camera and talking tomorrow and angular miracle
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.300]   I think is talking this time
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:11.980]   Morsey's talking so you have all you know these heads of state and big important people coming and it's kind of fascinating to be here at the same time
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.020]   I don't know how the hell I got in but what the heck i'm here
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:18.780]   So i'm staying the other thing if I may bill i'm going to introduce you all to my roommate
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.940]   ah

[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.700]   Because that's what it's like this this is a typical davos room and eight fancy folks
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:37.580]   That's spartan i'm gonna put the camera back with murphy beds and uh, but um
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.300]   It's because we um

[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:01.340]   If if we go off the next time, you know, it's because uh built plugged in
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.980]   um his um
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:09.500]   His shaver. Yes. Uh, so so the rooms are so tight here that when bill

[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:18.620]   So um, I volunteered for him to bunk with me
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:23.580]   So i'm staying with rofen was entrepreneur bill gross in this horrible, uh, little uh, little room
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:31.500]   But that's davos so it's elitist. It's the powerful. It's the mockers, but we're in crappy hotels and we complain about it
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:36.620]   Orslob, who org is organizes this who is who is this?
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:42.060]   This is dr. Professor Klaus Schwab who is the greatest accent you've ever heard
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:46.220]   First year I was here at Klaus Schwab. He's his German and Swiss
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:50.620]   Uh, he was at a party thrown by borda, which is tonight. I'm missing for your sake folks
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.220]   Oh wow, and he got up on stage. This is the days of uh of second life
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:58.940]   He got up on stage and he said I have an avita
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:11.900]   And uh, so Schwab is this amazing guy who decided to do this 42 years ago and put it together and now it's this
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:17.740]   No greater collection of bikers. Can you imagine that when he put together and he's just he just does it
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:26.220]   It's 42 years of state heads of companies technology has really changed this mean a lot more. I'm sure a lot more entrepreneurial a lot less governmental
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:31.420]   Incredibly, and listen you can you can knock the forum for being
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:36.140]   Uh, the elite and the establishment that's certainly true and the bankers are here and the government's here
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:40.060]   But they also I have to give them a lot of credit they do do a good job of trying to bring in
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:46.300]   Technology pioneers and what they call young global leaders and people I really respect greatly young people who are under 40
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:51.900]   We're here now. They have a new group called. It's sounds of its science science fictionist, but they come in the shapers
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.460]   the glen global shapers
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.860]   Um sounds like they change shape when they will
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.100]   Uh, but they're under 30
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:03.180]   And so they try to what i've said about davos the last three years is that i'm among the disrupted
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:07.420]   I'd prefer to be among the disruptors, but they try to bring in some disruptors as well
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:12.140]   And you know, so you can give me crap for coming and I would deserve it
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:18.380]   But I figure I have the chance to come because I helped them with blogging seven years ago and they they've forgotten to disinvite me
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.540]   and um
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.300]   And so I get to come and I get to hobnob and and do amazing things I got
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.740]   Well, the way down here we went to the dld conference in um munich
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.220]   And I had a dinner there
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.220]   with arthur salt's burger at the times
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:37.740]   Who i've gotten to know better because I come here even there were extra neighbors and uh, alak ross from the state department
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.060]   and um max levchin
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:44.060]   And uh just amazing people that's what what happens is you end up with these
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:48.540]   You know lunches and dinners and car rides with some amazing people and so I can't pass it up
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:54.700]   It's it's too interesting. No, and you go as our proxy. So it's nice. Gina and I don't have to go because you do
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:59.900]   I'm here as of course. Yeah, it's kind of like food camp for the rich and famous. Yeah
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.900]   I'm here as a as a twig schlub. Yeah
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:06.220]   And you're appropriately attired. Yeah
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:10.060]   Next year, Gina. I will wear I'll wear the fez instead. How would that be?
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:13.820]   Have you gone have you gone? Uh matthew. I know you said you were invited. Have you gone before?
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:17.340]   No, I never have I was joking about being invited. Oh, I've never
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:26.540]   Um um went though. Oh malak. Yeah, um is there and then and dld before what is dld jeff? What is that all about?
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:31.340]   Uh boarda, which is a big german publisher uh holds this conference always right before davos
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.860]   And so they get the davosians to come there and it's wildly overcrowded
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:41.900]   Uh and marx ockertberg spoke there. Uh, what in 2006 I think it was that's in me and he bragged
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:46.940]   In music and he bragged then that he had the facebook had just gone and he was so amazed
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:50.140]   I watched this happen from one million to two million users
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:56.220]   And now joe joe shondorf that was there from excel who invested in facebook of course and who said, you know now they're over a billion
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:53:02.220]   This is this is pretty much amazing. Uh dld is a good conference. It's it's it's it's wildly wildly overcrowded
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:07.980]   But the hallway is great. I did a session with lufthansa there, which is how I got over frankly full disclosure
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:09.260]   uh
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.780]   uh
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:15.580]   Imagining with a whole bunch of entrepreneurs in the room. What it would be like to turn an airline into an api
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:20.380]   And it was actually a fascinating kind of conversation you could have there and then I was on a journalism panel where
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.940]   I caused some fuss because you know what I talked about folks. You know what I talked about what?
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:31.020]   I we get ready chad you're ready to cue it here likes fucks in the govin lice should correct
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:39.420]   Lights did you do it to a reggae beat jeffrey? No, I did tell the german's not not the panel
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:43.260]   I didn't say this but I did all the german's offstage, but they didn't put to a reggae beat
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:49.260]   And then just watch muck in twitter. I'm sure he's a very nice guy. He always tries to correct me
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.260]   So I know it's lice don't shoot right
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:56.940]   No, it's all right. I get I get them on an american is a hum in there
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:02.140]   And then a poor friend of mine a very good friend of mine brilliant brilliant editor and publisher named cutterator bonkert
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:07.100]   Works for a big publisher. I talk about this very very controversial thing in german even publishers
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:12.940]   It's in front of all these publishers and then the moderator asked her what she thinks played her on a horrible hot spot
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:17.740]   Uh, but this was actually very controversial here to talk about that. So it's been it's been an issue week
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:21.500]   I fly back on sunday and i'll be glad to be back and then go back into class on monday
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.780]   Did you did you ask? I'll put for that
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:28.860]   Did you ask arthur oaks saltzberger about the
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.580]   report from the post
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:38.060]   I'm sorry the new york magazine that donald trump it was in negotiations to buy the gray lady did you ask him about that?
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:43.580]   No, I didn't but I have my own little donald trump story leo since he happened to bring him up
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.820]   Okay, so here's my donald trump story. So so you remember that
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:54.940]   Deadspin had the big scoop about the noordane player who had the apparently imaginary girlfriend, right?
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:55:01.100]   And donald trump came online and and said this is a funny twitter twitter battle. Yeah
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:08.940]   So it gets there's another chapter you probably know about so trump comes along online and he says kudos to reporter reporter and
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:12.060]   And I think misspelled more than names or something and that's been
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:18.620]   And that's been in in true gakarish denton style responded in full and i'll abbreviate it
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.140]   f u
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:21.660]   Yes
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:22.460]   So
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:29.420]   And and this lasts for a little while going on people treated like saying but of course i'm in this plate this gig lately for the internet
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.740]   What the hell? Jeffs come on
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:34.060]   Oh, so I wrote this piece and I just said you know
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:39.580]   For once i'm actually sympathizing with donald trump which of course brought the wrath of the net down upon me
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:47.100]   And so to excuse myself for this I said well, you know folks i'm not a fan of donald trump when I was sunday editor of the new york daily news
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:51.580]   I did a cover uh that donald trump was uh the great has been
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:56:00.460]   So that sat there for a few days then suddenly out of nowhere. I get a tweet from donald trump saying you were a lousy editor and you were
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:02.620]   oh my god
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:06.860]   Nice welcome to the list jeff javas now we know why you're in davas
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:13.260]   You're on the enemies list because i'm more important than donald trump. I'm here and you're not donald
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:20.940]   So it sounded like maybe i misunderstood this that was donald giving him a backhanded compliment when he said in my bandwidth, didn't it?
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:25.020]   Yeah, no, he was complimenting that he was complimenting him. They said f u
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:30.140]   And then he says dead spins disgusting response will teach me and others not to be nice anymore
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:33.580]   A sad lesson and then he hasn't said enough so he says
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:41.900]   Dead spin guys are total losers. It is the other story stolen right out from under their bad complexions other me other media capitalized
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:48.620]   Yeah, they got 80 billion page views i'm following the real Donald trump this guy has something to say
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:54.060]   Holy cow i want to see this isn't any and he's slimed you wow
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:58.940]   It's like me and and so I said back you know jeez this is what i get for being nice to you
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:06.180]   L
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:12.700]   I can't remember who it was i saw it go by on twitter and they said i got an official response from soles burger
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:16.220]   To the rumor and then it was just the word laughter
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:21.020]   Trump doesn't have enough money the times is valued at over a billion dollars i don't think trump
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:28.860]   Is gonna spend a billion dollars on an iffy proposition like the new york times i think it was anthony to rosa ros of roiders who who said on twitter and he was right he said
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:31.180]   Well we cover the i the the the the
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:36.780]   The chance of donald trump becoming president and binder new york times is equal but we like covering it anyway
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:46.060]   This is trump he you know he looks for the places where he can get attention and uh and plant stories i'm sure
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:52.620]   I mean his most recent tweet almost every television network wants me badly, but i stay loyal to nbc
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:56.700]   Oh i love dramatic reading in the voice
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.900]   I can't do his voice, but all his tweets in his voice
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:02.780]   So great, can you do the hair?
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.660]   You probably
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:11.020]   I know what kind of animal it came from so i just have to get a piece of that fur pull it forward
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:15.660]   It's the result of the fact that your hair is way better get better hair than there you go. That's not saying much
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:20.620]   That's not saying much, but it's it's it's much much much. Yeah
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:22.780]   Wow
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:26.540]   So he slimed you um that's good jeff i think that's you're in a you're in good company
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:28.700]   Yeah, chief and unlocked
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:30.700]   Yeah
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:39.180]   There's there's my there's my bucket list. I just need Desmond tutu to insult me now and i'm
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:41.980]   You're there. Yeah
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:43.980]   Wow
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:46.380]   All right, i'm gonna stop reading donald trump's twitter feed and move
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:49.740]   Please leo please yeah
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:56.220]   Uh social graph nothing more to say we talked a lot about it last week the new facebook search
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:58.860]   Um, have you guys gotten it?
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:06.060]   Not yet have you yes, just got enabled on my account. Uh yesterday. I applied, you know or whatever you give them your
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:08.940]   Yeah, they must be rolling out
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:11.100]   How do you know you it would give you a banner?
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:17.500]   It's i mean leo you couldn't miss it. It's across the top they replace the facebook logo like the word facebook does not appear
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:21.420]   It's it's the f and then it says, you know search for people places and things
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:26.140]   That's what surprised me the most about this is that this is the first thing top left of the page
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:30.140]   It's the first bit of ui that you when you home to facebook that they want you to do
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:34.140]   It's just it looks it makes it look like a search engine. So you'll you'll be you'll see it
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:37.900]   When you get it so what was your first search did you do anything?
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:41.020]   Well, you know you click in the box and it has this kind of auto suggest
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:47.260]   So the you know the first things that it suggests are these like basic searches my friends photos of my friends restaurants nearby
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:52.940]   Games my friends play so I just started typing you know photos or a name of a friend
[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:56.940]   Uh, and you can do things like things that's leo
[00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:03.980]   Laport likes let's try so you just start to i've experimented with it a little bit and this suggests is actually quite quite fast
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:09.020]   Uh, and you keep being like, oh, yeah, you know show me a chinese restaurant in san francisco that my friends like
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:13.020]   And uh, there was it's actually pretty useful. I have to say it was i
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.780]   More useful than i thought that it would be now that i have it
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.020]   Well, i'm interested to see if you agree when you get it
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:23.020]   Uh, do you feel encouraged now to put more data in there do more liking
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:27.180]   Uh tag stuff more elaborately in other words make it more useful to your friends
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.620]   Well, you know, I use facebook
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:34.620]   I'm kind of on the fence about facebook so it actually makes me want to draw back a little bit
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:38.300]   It made me want to change my likes, you know to make kind of get them up to date
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.220]   And uh, i'll think more when i like things i don't know
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:44.220]   Do i want to hide any
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:48.780]   I don't think that there weren't any that i want to hide there's just something i'm just sort of out of date
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:53.500]   You know, i'm just not as into battle star galactic and now as i was when it was airing that that type of thing
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.540]   Uh, just you know just just updating stuff
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.580]   I don't know
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:01.820]   Yeah, maybe a little more cautious
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:06.540]   The the one search that i really like are photos that i've liked which is just basically a list of my front
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.260]   You know, it's just a bunch of photos of my friends like kids and pets
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:15.740]   Um, but before i like a photo i'll probably think about it a little bit more because now i know that's a sort of public facing view
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.820]   Um, but for the most part it's pretty it's it's pretty useful
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:24.700]   Did you see the um the tumblr blog actual facebook graph searches?
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:30.700]   Yeah, it's it's kind of disturbing actually because one of the first ones is
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:34.060]   Uh, man interested in men who live in tay ron
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:37.980]   Oh, there's another one. Uh, yeah, that's dangerous
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:41.980]   Well in the so the mothers of jews who like bacon
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.860]   Right
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:46.860]   That's not nice
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.860]   people who who like ashley mattison
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:52.860]   mary people who like prostitutes how about that
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.820]   current tesco employees who like horses
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:02:00.300]   Current employees of people you get that one you know what that that was that yeah
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.260]   There were tesco burgers in the uk that were found
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.220]   Made out of genetic material of horses horse mate. Okay
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:12.620]   Current employers of people who like racism. Mm-hmm. Uh, the usr racism like
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.580]   Apparently you can
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:21.100]   So at some point somebody set up a page that was like racism or i mean, you know, there are pages for everything
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:25.340]   There's big for sexism and pooping my pants like there's all kinds of crazy pages
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:29.100]   And if you've liked them as a kind of a joke or whatever at some time
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.540]   Then it shows up in this new context which kind of seems
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.580]   A lot more
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:38.780]   The tumbler blog is kind of a joke, but it's sort of disturbing
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:43.820]   Yeah, but you'd have to be an idiot if you're married to like ashley mattison, which is a
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:46.540]   Site where you find people to cheat with
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:50.860]   Uh, you're you're doing that publicly. Why would you like it? I mean, that's stupid
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:59.180]   But I think you a lot of people don't see it as public they see it as somewhere in this gray area between public and private
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.820]   Yeah, be careful what you like
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.620]   Mm-hmm, right. That's the lesson. Yeah
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:08.140]   People who like focus on the family and kneel patrick haris
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:12.940]   That's funny by the way, they they um
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:17.900]   They just show that there's results. They black out the the actual results
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:22.140]   And you can see how you can target even more closely on the right hand side
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:27.420]   Right right gender refinance search and there's all the geographic. Yeah
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:33.580]   I can see friends with my friends who like racism. Sorry. There are no results for the search
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.300]   Good good job friends of friends good
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:42.940]   The friends of my friends is interesting isn't it though because now you're getting a little deeper into the weeds
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:50.700]   Well, that's not randy zuckerberg's photo god. Exactly. Exactly. And I think that's the single biggest data leak point on facebook
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.260]   Friends of friends of friends. Yeah
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:58.460]   Single women who live nearby who are interested in men and like getting drunk
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.940]   There was also one getting the single women drunk
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:10.140]   That's a search. I want to make a note of
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:16.540]   This is funny. It's uh actual facebook graph searches dot tumblr.com tom scott
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:20.620]   He says don't worry. We'll all be used to this in a few weeks time
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:28.300]   Yeah, I mean, you know on the one hand you you are doing this publicly
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.380]   with your likes and all
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:34.460]   So it is it is the question
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:39.580]   You know, I think generally you're right if you said you liked something that it ends up there and people are going out of the board
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:43.660]   But but there is a question of presumed use and that's where
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:49.980]   We're always going to end up with a syncopation problem with data. Yeah, gee. I never thought that it would be used that way
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.780]   Um and and a lot of times that's well
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:58.620]   Geez, he shouldn't put it up there, but a lot of times that's also. Oh, yeah, you got a point that looks bad now
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:06.220]   Steve chaney who's uh, and you think of that later biz dev at a group on road a blog post he calls them dirty likes likes that
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:12.300]   Uh, you know, you didn't you know at the time they didn't have any import, you know, I wanted a coupon
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.300]   So I liked you know chipotle
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.180]   But now all of a sudden because of the search they have import
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.100]   And that's a good point
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:24.860]   Like I think is what he's saying is the signals that those are those likes or whatever transmitting
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:30.460]   Aren't as valuable as they seem to be because you don't know the context in which you liked it
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.020]   You know, you might have had to like something in order to get
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.700]   Access to a site or you know like like gating or whatever
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:40.300]   So you don't really know why that person clicked on that thing and now it's just
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:44.220]   Part of that construct that virtual you that facebook is creating
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:49.260]   I'm going to give uh jeff javis a number because this uh blog post has a he's he's gone again
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:53.500]   Unfortunately, this blog this blog post has a kind of surprising number in it
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:58.300]   So when we get it back on us home, I'm gonna give you a gift jeff javis
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:01.020]   I'm gonna go down on my link
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.220]   From petaluma to davos petaluma to davos. It's amazing
[01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:07.820]   Could we do this if it weren't for the magic of the internet?
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:10.140]   We couldn't
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.140]   No, would we want to?
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:14.300]   No
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.660]   So i'm gonna put a i'm gonna give you a
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:21.740]   I'm gonna give you a number jeff. I'm gonna put it in the uh
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.620]   I'm gonna put it in the uh, it's like i'm putting
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:28.220]   I just thought of one. Oh you thought of one good then i'll use it use this
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:30.940]   This is from the steve chaney article
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:34.620]   Facebook has convinced a lot of advertisers spent a lot of money to generate likes
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:37.580]   Did you know for instance according to steve chaney who?
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.540]   Is biz dev a group on so he probably does know this fact
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:48.140]   Over the past several years american express has spent about half of its total ad spend buying likes on facebook
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:50.460]   tens of millions of dollars
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:54.460]   That's how important to them and they knew because you know what they're right
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.260]   That probably was good money well spent
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:07.980]   In fact, he says across the board big advertisers were told by facebook to spend about half of their ad by on fan acquisition
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:11.340]   Not just by facebook but by agencies and experts
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:19.180]   Well, I think yeah, I specifically now because of the graph search that like has some value doesn't it?
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:22.220]   Not that anybody's gonna search for restaurants
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.900]   That my friends who like american express like
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:31.500]   I think the question is how much value I mean how much value doesn't single like have
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:38.940]   Um because you don't know what that person meant by clicking like it's really it's a blunt instrument
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:41.020]   Yeah, sometimes you like stuff you hate
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:45.180]   Right sometimes on ironic like sarcastic right
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:47.100]   Oh, I like that
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:52.380]   Or sometimes, you know, somebody will put up a tribute or say something about someone who was killed or something like that
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:55.340]   And you like what they said, but it makes it seem like you like the murder
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.180]   Right
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.180]   Exactly that happens all the time
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.740]   There's new nuance. It's just like
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:07.820]   I just tried credit cards my friends like and that did not work. Ah
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:11.580]   Interesting
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:16.780]   What do you think about john betta this is one for you jeff jarvis john bettaill who says twitter's
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:18.780]   actually a media company
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:22.700]   And wrote about that too. Yeah, okay matthew
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:29.580]   That sounds reasonable. It's a little disturbing to me, but uh because i'm a media company and i'm twit
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:34.460]   And uh, we kind of had a gentleman's agreement. I wasn't gonna do a social media network
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:38.380]   And twitter wasn't gonna get into media, but I guess it's too late now. Uh oh
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:41.020]   Yeah, I hear they're starting a tv show
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.300]   Yeah, they're doing a tv show
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:46.060]   But really the contents of twitter and twitter's moved in this the point
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:52.220]   I think of this article and others is that twitter through the use of its embedding in into the twitter stream and so forth
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.620]   Is turning the twitter website?
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.820]   Into a media stream
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:00.460]   Yeah, I think
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:05.340]   I think john's point was that all of that content and this is actually related to facebook too
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:12.220]   Depending on how you look at it facebook is a giant user generated content media company as well and the point
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.380]   He was making was all of that data
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:17.420]   Billions of tweets, you know half a billion a day
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:20.140]   all of that information is
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:22.140]   is data that that
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:27.340]   Twitter can use to show you more relevant content show you more relevant ads
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:32.940]   All the things that media companies are trying to do and theoretically if they can figure it out
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:37.660]   I mean my point was their relevance needs to get better facebook's relevance needs to get better
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:42.540]   How do they determine what signal to look at and what not to look at they're you know
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:49.260]   If you look at the discover tab or or even the emails they need to do some work on making that stuff really relevant
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:58.620]   Um, but that's clearly where they're going one of the things betel suggests is that twitter will add to its trends a happenings
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.700]   Uh
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:06.780]   Page or or section where you can see hurricane sandy the world cup, you know, whatever's going on right now
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:11.900]   And and then it really is. I mean, it's and it's true when when a celebrity dies where there's a
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:17.020]   Storm like sandy where do we go? We often go to twitter to get the latest direct news
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:21.820]   And this this happens on tv all the time, right? I feel like that would events are going on. I mean
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:27.020]   Twitter like new years eve right like the ticker at the bottom is just tweets
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:32.380]   I mean clearly curated edited tweets, right? But they say hey, you'll see an end to this like hey use this hashtag
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:37.420]   And then there's somebody behind the scenes saying yeah, let that one not let that one go let that one go
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:41.420]   Uh, so you really could see twitter just doing that having a sort of actually
[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:47.420]   News shows i've noticed even with events. They'll just read tweets like yeah, they'll just read tweets
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.980]   This happened and then just read tweet. I know it's so sad
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:52.780]   It's so I can yeah
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.420]   So pathetic I can read the tweets myself. Thank you
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:11:01.740]   I'll just go to twitter now. I guess I mean we've talked about like that's what Andy carvin does right? I mean he's just like
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:06.540]   master curator of tweets for various events. Yeah
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:09.820]   So
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:16.060]   Go ahead only risk to me at least is that you know twitter is a single entity, right? It's a company. I agree
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:24.220]   They they control this giant sort of user-generated media entity that we're all contributing to I mean that has risks as well as benefits
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:27.900]   Well, somebody in the chat room said twitter's not news. It's gossip
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:34.140]   I don't know if that's fair. I think it is news when it's the uh, Arab spring or it's hercane sandy
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:39.660]   Yeah, uh lots of news is gossip. Let's face it rumors about apples earning right what's that right?
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:43.500]   It's it's unfiltered more. I mean I think if you're gonna say well, here's the problem
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:48.460]   It's not that it's gossip but that it's unfiltered right and so twitter is trying to come up with filters
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:53.900]   Right just like facebook's trying to come up with filters and it's partly for you and it's partly for advertisers
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.660]   Right. Yeah, the better it does this the better it can target ads
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.740]   um
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:01.580]   Any trust
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:07.580]   Action going on it's been going on for a couple of years now against google as well as apple intel
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.900]   and others
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.820]   Uh, it's apparently illegal
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:17.500]   And if you think about it, there's good reason for it to be illegal for companies to agree with one another we won't poach your employees
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:24.460]   Um, it's being heard right now. In fact, uh apple chief executive, uh, tim cook is being deposed
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.740]   even as we speak
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:30.700]   uh, the problem is, uh, that um
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:35.020]   In fact, there's there's steve jobs even apparently threatened
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:40.140]   palm saying if you don't if you keep poaching our employees
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:43.340]   We're gonna we're gonna sue you for patents
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:47.340]   You know bringing out the big gun
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:52.140]   Uh, so these all these silicon valley companies agreed and the reason it's not it is in fact part of antitrust law
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.220]   It is it is illegal
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:59.420]   And the reason it is is because it disadvantages employees if I can't go across the street and get a better job
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:02.060]   you can keep my
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.060]   compensation low
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:11.260]   So, uh, this is a this is a huge and continuing story
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:13.420]   um
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:17.020]   Intuit ebay google apple adobe
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:20.060]   Intel pixar
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:24.540]   All involved in 2010 those companies agreed to a settlement
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:31.020]   That they won't do it anymore, but the uh, but the potential for a class action lawsuit continues
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:39.660]   We talked about it before but just uh, it's uh, this is the new information
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:43.340]   Hey leo, yeah
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:49.020]   I'm driving poor chat crazy. Can I maybe do a number and then uh knock off? Yeah, let's uh, let's wrap it up
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:54.300]   We're gonna we'll let you do your number. I'll take a break and uh, then we'll get uh tips and tools and all of that
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.300]   Go ahead. What is your number my friend?
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.620]   And I'm chat. I'm here. You have no video. Okay. It's all right. Just talk we hear you
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:06.620]   Okay, okay. Okay. So here's the imagine jeff wearing a sabbat. Yes, I'll put it on
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:09.260]   And believe it. I'm worried
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:14.700]   So Sebastian throne who's the amazing guy google who created the uh self-driving car
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:19.740]   Who also was sounded udacity. He was on a panel today about whether self-driving cars are real or not
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:24.220]   Moderated by david carpatrick and then i'll just have a number so i can have a number
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:28.460]   He said that there are three parking spots in america for every car. Wow
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:34.220]   And so there's an infrastructure cost that if we had cars that really got shared all around
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:41.020]   Uh, but what here's this little added guilt that i'm using as an excuse that I loved and I hope i'm not violating anything by saying this
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:46.220]   But but he basically I think has one of these things a time and home
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:49.980]   And and somebody asked what it's like and he says it's really magical and at first you're
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:54.460]   It's magical that for about 10 minutes you start to trust the car more
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:59.500]   And uh, so he said that uh his wife
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:03.980]   Oftentimes will ask him to stop driving himself and just turn on the automatic car
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:08.060]   Which I found very honest of him and quite amazing
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:12.540]   That that's where the the self-driving car is and it just sounds amazing
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:15.900]   There was a guy from a major executive from upis on the panel
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:20.060]   Talked about all the data they have and how they they really do train them just to turn right
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:25.580]   And all that kind of stuff and and he got all excited about this notion talking about how you could have the driver
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:28.940]   Not driving back in the back of the truck getting the next delivery ready. Wow
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:32.860]   So that was that was an amazing novelist moment that gave me a fake number of the week
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.420]   And uh, and I apologize
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.380]   Otherwise, I apologize to you for being a horrible uh on bed
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:39.260]   No, I am
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:41.820]   I am thrilled that you uh
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:45.180]   Made the effort to be on the show and you were on the show for an hour and a half
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:48.460]   And furthermore that you gave up that party. Is it too late to go?
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:50.940]   No, no, I'm not going that i'm too old
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:54.940]   But but his punishment jazz put up the photo of me that I hate most on earth
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:16:01.980]   That's cool. Fuck. It looks like a sour puss like i've got an eye flowing up my rear
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:07.500]   Uh, I hate that photo. I hate that phone. Yeah, well scouples. Look at that

[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:17.420]   I don't see anyone else here. You're talking to me anyone else. It's the photo on your look at the media page
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:25.900]   Oh for jeff somebody somebody take a creative commons photo of jeff and put it on his wikipedia smiling smiling
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.700]   Poor jeff, sorry chat
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:33.340]   Just you all night. The chats called me back more often than the audience knows because they give me some more off now
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:38.860]   Up in the on the hot spot. But uh, but anyway, so I I figure I better sign off. We'll let you go more
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:44.620]   Thank you. I love you guys. I'll see you in the United States of america. Good
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:47.980]   I don't want it when you get back. I want to ask you about the harpers editor who
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:55.180]   Who compared who compared google to baby talk and said it's equivalent of the sensitization of violence
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:17:00.220]   We'll do I should have talked about that. It's a great story, but I can't do it without jeff our media commentator
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.220]   So we'll do it next week
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.700]   And obviously
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.660]   Mina fronda lee shun zeitshreft
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:15.740]   Thank you jeff jivers
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:20.380]   We'll get our tool and our tip of the week and if matthew engrom you got anything off the top of your head
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:25.100]   You want to throw in you will get that opportunity too. But first a word from ting
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:28.540]   Ting is making mobile
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:31.020]   better
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:36.220]   Ting is a no bs mobile phone service that you really ought to check out there based on the sprint network
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:39.820]   So if you've got grid sprint connectivity, then you want to try ting
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:43.980]   You can uh, it's an mvno. That's the technical term and mobile
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:46.540]   virtual network operator
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:52.060]   Uh reselling sprint service and frankly don't don't don't sprint doing a much better job of it
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:56.460]   So here's the way it works. There's no early termination fee. There's no contract
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:02.220]   So, you know you you pay month to month and you don't ever pay a penalty
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:07.180]   So here's an and you get a rebate if you don't use as many minutes as you said you'd use
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.500]   So here's how it works you pick a pick a plan
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:13.420]   You don't have to pick you can pick a zero plan and just pay as you go if you want
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:18.380]   The uh, as many phones as you want on your plan each phone is $6 a month
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:22.780]   So let's say I have a family of four or a small business. I'm gonna have four phones
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:25.420]   Um, I'll give you an example
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:27.820]   Uh, let's say a thousand minutes
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:30.220]   nationwide calling
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:31.260]   Uh
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.380]   Text messages with a thousand a month. That's probably plenty
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:41.580]   Uh, three gigabytes. Let's go for all the data we can eat that plan per month for a family of four 107 bucks
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:46.220]   Period for not each for the whole family
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:50.700]   That's probably probably less than than your pan right now for one phone
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:57.020]   Tings got other great features. They hot spotting and tethering included three-way calling free
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:00.300]   Call forwarding caller id voicemail. I love it that you can do
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:06.700]   You know hot spotting on the phone for free and by the way, they've got great devices to choose from all the way up
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:12.140]   To the galaxy note two the samson galaxy s3. They have less expensive phones as well
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:15.900]   Um, they have the optimus g if you wanted an xs4
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:20.140]   You can't get one the optimus g basically is kind of the nexus for unbound
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:26.300]   And when you go to twig.ting.com and use the twig offer code, you're gonna take 25 bucks right off the top
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:31.580]   Now it's unsubsidized prices because there's no termination fee. There's no month, you know contract
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:37.020]   It's month to month. They do have very good prices, but they're not subsidized you're paying for the phone. It's yours. You own it
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:44.620]   You get a lot of other great features and and the ability to manage your your account from a dashboard to see everything that's going on
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:48.300]   I am a big fan. Ting really wants to reinvent
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:51.740]   The way cell phones work
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:56.780]   I want you to visit twig.ting.com and find out
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:20:03.260]   More by the way, they have you can bring an existing sprint device to ting. So if you're a sprint customer
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:09.340]   You might want to just take a look at the their beta the public beta of the bring your own device
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:17.980]   And uh find out, you know how to do it. I am a big fan of ting. They've got forums. They've got great help no hold
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.460]   uh toll-free
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:23.820]   Support anytime between eight and five eight a.m. And eight p.m. Eastern
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:28.700]   I just I can go on and on but I don't think I should have to just go to ting
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:33.340]   twig.ting.com get 25 off your first device and find out how great
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:36.940]   A phone a cell phone company really can be
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:40.220]   They really are amazing
[01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:41.660]   Uh
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:46.140]   Let us get to jina trapani and her tip of the week
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.780]   Just a little tip this week
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:53.740]   I've been really into communities on google plus much more than I thought I would be and I
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:57.740]   I should probably take this opportunity to uh plug the twig community
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:58.380]   Yes
[01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:00.300]   And and the all about android community
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:04.940]   I use both of them to prep for the shows and to hear from listeners and fantastic
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:10.860]   Uh, but if you don't want your communities posts to show up on your google plus profile
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.940]   Like in the post area of the google plus profile
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:16.380]   You can do that and it's just a new setting that google rolled out
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.220]   I think i think a week ago in the past week
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:27.180]   You could just go into your google plus settings and you can uncheck a box that says show your your communities posts on the post tab of your profile
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:30.860]   Just a little thing but if you really like posting about android or
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:34.860]   Photography or cooking or whatever if you're really active in the community
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:37.260]   But you just don't want that to show up on your profile
[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:41.980]   You can you want to public you post publicly in the community, but you don't want to show up in your profile
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:47.660]   You can do that now just just uncheck that setting and you can do so and you should check out the twig community and join it
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:53.100]   If you're if you're listening now, uh because um, I've got my ears on and there and I love to hear from listeners
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:59.100]   That's awesome and I agree with reposter who says you are killing it and all about android
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.820]   No, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm really glad to have you as a host there
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:06.540]   Jason and ron and that is such a good show if you're if you're into uh
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:13.100]   Android phones and and I guess we all are probably all about android is fantastic. Those guys are awesome. It's for there
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:16.860]   It's a lot of fun. It's a really it's kind of goofy laid back lots of cool transitions chad
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:21.260]   We hear from chat a lot more which I really like it's a lot of fun having that doing the show good
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:26.780]   Well, thank you so much for being a part of it. We really appreciate it smart aware.org for jina tripani
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.100]   Matthew anything you want to toss in?
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:34.940]   I guess since we mentioned android i've been uh, i've been testing out an android phone
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:39.500]   I was an iphone user have been for years and i've been trying out a droid
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.660]   razor hd
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:44.540]   And I have to say one of the things I was afraid of
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:50.220]   Giving up was apples photo stream where all your photos are synced across all your apple devices
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:53.020]   And I discovered this thing called open photo
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:59.660]   Which i've been using you can either use their hosting or you can use uh s3 and i've got an s3 account
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:05.980]   So it automatically all my photos from uh from the phone or or sent up to open photo
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:12.860]   It's got a great website and so it it reproduces a lot of what i liked about photo stream and um, yeah
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:19.100]   It's great you can also use dropbox for that and you know google plus does it automatically with the google plus app on android
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:25.420]   Just turn on the instant uploads and everything gets uploaded makes it easy to share i i really like that feature
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:30.620]   I do too and they actually have a great built-in editor too at google plus i've been using that a lot
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:34.860]   So it's aviary they get auto uploaded and then i go and tweak them there. It's good for that
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:37.580]   Very good
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:40.220]   uh, this one just came from um
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:43.180]   The uh security now show
[01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:46.940]   I had no idea you could do this you probably knew this jina, but you can type in
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:51.420]   Into google search. What is my ip address?
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:53.980]   Yeah, i've done that. Oh, yeah
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:56.540]   Yeah, yeah
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:24:00.140]   Yeah, that's that's great. You can make it even shorter just my ip
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:04.300]   Well, i guess i'm the last person in the world who knew about this
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:08.220]   I just i can never i can't get enough of these little like one box
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:13.660]   That's actually not it's not the fancy one box, but it is i love the i love the stuff that just gives you the answers right there
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:20.060]   And we were showing you the the one box for definitions i am i used to go to dictionary.com i'm not going to do it anymore just define
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.820]   uh
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.820]   a word
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:25.500]   uh anti dis
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.500]   Establishment
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:31.100]   Oh, I didn't even have to finish it. It just knew where i was going with that
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:37.420]   And uh, and it goes in boom in the one box is right there at the top i love the calculators really good too
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:43.020]   Yeah, every i think people know don't you everybody knows about the calculator. I also use a currency conversion
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:45.020]   Currency conversion yeah
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:52.540]   And measurements conversions so yeah, I watched uh, there's a great movie which I recommend jiro dreams of sushi have you seen that
[01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:57.260]   It's about the best sushi master in the world's documentary
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:59.900]   He's almost 90 years old
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:04.860]   And uh, he's the only three star michelan three he's the oldest michelan three stars chef
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:07.340]   The only sushi chef that I think that's a michelan three star
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:12.140]   And his his shop is in the in the subway at the ginsa tiny
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:14.860]   But at the very beginning
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.580]   They um, they say at the very beginning it's 30 000 yen
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:22.700]   uh for a meal
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:29.580]   And so I searched for 30 000 yet apparently i'm not the only one because that is immediately when you type 30 000 yen
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:31.580]   You get jiro dreams of sushi
