[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.440]   Lots more, too.

[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.040]   to show the covers, Google the Gurgleverse, the Gurgleverse,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.760]   Twitter, and more.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.760]   Look at that.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.880]   It's snowing in beautiful Brooklyn, Gina Trappani,
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.880]   and her mom's basement.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.680]   That's beautiful New Jersey, actually.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.200]   That's New Jersey.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.560]   Yes.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.800]   Not so many trees growing Brooklyn.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.960]   Not so many, just one.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.120]   I thought you lived in the botanical gardens.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.080]   I didn't know.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.320]   So that's Jeff.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.040]   OK, not Gina.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.000]   OK.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.240]   So what's cool about this, I got to say,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.640]   is that you get that thing that only happens after there's
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.800]   a snow and then a melt and then a refreeze where you get ice.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.880]   Oh, it's so much fun.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.360]   Yeah, I was holding the branches for an hour.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.480]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.960]   Love that when that happens.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.280]   Well, I hate you, California.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.120]   Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.760]   You're just so obnoxious.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.640]   No, it's pretty.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.360]   It's really pretty.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.440]   I love seeing all the Instagram pictures
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.640]   when I woke up this morning, a beautiful sunny day
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.320]   in Northern California.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.120]   I see all the Instagram pictures of ice, snow.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.320]   You should see if you should get video of me with a snow blower.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.560]   I talked to mom this morning.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.320]   She's in Providence.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.160]   She said, Grady, her nephew, lives around the corner,
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.520]   my nephew, her grandson, came over to shovel the walk
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.240]   this morning very early.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.880]   And then he came back an hour later and shoveled it again.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.360]   That's depressing.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.520]   Hey, that's Matt Cutts laughing.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.240]   Hey there.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.400]   Matt and I are in California.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.280]   Good to see everybody.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.720]   Where do you get a giant Tyrannosaurus Rex decal?
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.120]   That is awesome.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.000]   You can get it from Amazon, you know?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.200]   It's on the internet.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.640]   It was a Christmas present.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.240]   For you or your son?
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.200]   Oh, no, no son.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.680]   No son.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.640]   And so it had to be you.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.000]   Just me.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.240]   See, that's a bit smart about kids.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.840]   You can get dinosaur reptiles on the wall and blame the kids.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.840]   Right, I'm just weird.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.520]   But it used to be Hello Kitty.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.240]   So I figured that out.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.080]   Oh, this is improvement.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.240]   Much more macho.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.120]   Also with his--
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.880]   Gina Tarpani, she's in her mom's basement.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.720]   I am.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.200]   I am.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   I'm honestly just owning it.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.640]   It's just happening.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.400]   I think we would have known.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.840]   I hate to say it.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.920]   The maple paneling.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.920]   The touchy cabinet.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.200]   I'm going to be a grown up and have my own place.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.120]   So my next week--
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.320]   You're just confirming what Aaron
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.860]   Sorkin's always known, that bloggers live in their mother's
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.360]   basement.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.440]   His basement.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.320]   Sorkin's watching this right now going, I told you.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.400]   Life hacker, my ass.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.880]   My ass.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.760]   She hasn't figured out how to pay bills, let alone act, life.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.840]   Anyway, nice to have you.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.080]   Gina's representing founding editor of Life Hacker.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.080]   And now I think up, which is a wonderful startup
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.280]   that analyzes all your Twitter and Facebook posts.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.160]   Very nice, very cool.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.080]   Thank you.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.280]   Nice.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.280]   How much is that?
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.320]   Everyone needs this.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   It's from roommates, 18 bucks.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   18 bucks, that's what we're doing.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.200]   Dinosaur peel and stick.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.960]   How big is it?
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.880]   Poor lemme talk.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.720]   It's pretty big.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   It's like four feet?
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.320]   36 inches?
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.400]   36 inches, 35 feet.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.960]   Wow.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.920]   It's pretty large.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   Nino.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.560]   It turns out you can get all kinds of weird wall to cow.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.560]   So I'm trying to resist the temptation.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.480]   There is a company that makes those for sporting figures.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.880]   So you can have a giant--
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.000]   Fatheads, stuff like that.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.960]   Yeah, fatheads.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.200]   Yeah, that knew it was a weird name.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.560]   Well, not only did you know the weird name, you remembered it.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.160]   Well, I guess that worked then.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.480]   So you can get a giant clay Matthews or something
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.120]   on your wall, which sounds a little scary, frankly,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.880]   coming at you.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.560]   You can also get a princess.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.400]   I want a giant Leole report.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   I think that's the next twin.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.800]   Fathead has not contacted me, but I
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.400]   would be willing to do a licensing deal.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.120]   Well, position, you have to be holding a keyboard or--
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.360]   I don't know, maybe a phone.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.720]   Maybe a social device.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.680]   Here's a giant Richard Sherman head.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.400]   That's a good thing to put on your wall.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.480]   Wow.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.560]   They jump right on those trends, don't they?
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.840]   Look at that.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.120]   So ladies and gentlemen, let me ask you, because Matt,
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.040]   you work at Google.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.040]   And we should mention this.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.000]   Matt Cutz is the guy who fights spam for us all,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.600]   keeping spammy results out of our search.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.160]   Yeah, amen.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.640]   He's been in the news a little bit lately.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.560]   Talk about that in a bit.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.360]   But there's a couple of big Google stories today,
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.960]   including Google and the European Commission settling
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.280]   their three-year ongoing investigation,
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.360]   anti-trust investigation.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.240]   Putting that behind him.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   The bells ring, the church bells ring on the Google campus.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.840]   Dingbells under which is dead.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.040]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.240]   So I'll say in advance the standard, don't fire me.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.520]   I'm speaking from a personal perspective disclaimer.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.920]   Yes.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.360]   But a lot of different people helped out with this.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.640]   And when it's three years long, you're always happy that you
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.160]   can find a good way to resolve it and have it be constructed.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.760]   So Google will not be fined and will not-- there is no finding
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.480]   of discrimination against competition.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.080]   FTC dropped their investigation in the US a year ago.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.000]   The FTC said, which must have meant you feel good.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.840]   Google was motivated more by innovation
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.240]   than by trying to stifle competition.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.720]   I think actually that's true.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.800]   I think it's true.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.200]   The pledge to the European Commission for five years
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.080]   says that you can add new services.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.320]   You can alter your search pages long as--
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.800]   this is always the weird thing, these stipulations.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.160]   You grant three links to rival services next to your own.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.680]   I kind of love this.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.400]   It's like Google is a genie.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.960]   You rub it so lamp, and it grants three wishes to you.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.200]   So if you have specialized search results
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.000]   like Google Shopping, which is really--
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.400]   Google Shopping is an ad.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.320]   All those results are paid.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:06.560]   Then competitors can pay at least three euro cents
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.200]   to bid for a spot in a shaded box next to it.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.520]   That is bizarre.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.640]   Just bizarre.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.640]   When regulation-- I'm going to brussell to the EU in next month
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.120]   to talk about government and the internet.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.800]   Of course, you know what I'm going to say.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.000]   Stay away.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.840]   Goodbye.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.240]   It'll be a very short address.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:28.880]   It will be.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.600]   Yes.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.360]   Actually, if the bidding--
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.440]   is real bidding, they could actually make some money on this.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.360]   I mean, it starts at $0.04, but it doesn't mean it ends at $0.04.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   And I would imagine you'd want to be in that shaded box there.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.160]   Anyway, good news.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.000]   That's over.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.960]   The other big story, which I think
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.840]   happened before after our show last week.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.240]   Yes, Lenovo, Bismol.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.760]   We talked about it last week.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.260]   We did.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:08:59.760]   OK.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.040]   It was breaking as we spoke.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.560]   That's right.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.920]   In fact, that's right.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.640]   We were doing it basically as breaking news.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.640]   OK.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.160]   And then finally, there's a new head of YouTube.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.320]   So it sounds like Solar and Susan Wojcicki
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.800]   are going to sort of trade roles a little bit in that Susan
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.160]   is going to come over and be the head of YouTube.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.360]   And Solar is going to presumably work on some new project
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.920]   that they'll reveal at some point in the future.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.880]   This doesn't change Kinsil's role.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.760]   I don't believe so.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.080]   And I think Solar has built up a great organization.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.400]   They've done a fantastic job.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.000]   If you think about it several years ago, people said,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.720]   oh, YouTube has to be costing Google a ton of money.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   And now everybody realizes that it's a great outlet.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.280]   It's a great opportunity.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.840]   Sure, there's more we could do.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.200]   I always hear the complaints that you mentioned about the
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.680]   spurious DMCA complaints.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.080]   And I passed those on to people that you--
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   Oh, thank you.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.040]   I thought it was--
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.040]   I thought it was thoroughly ignored on all of that.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.280]   No, no.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.240]   It took a little while for me to get to the threshold where I
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.000]   was like, OK, I need to go find someone to mention that
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.840]   about.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.240]   Thank you.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.440]   Thank you.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.160]   Sure, no.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.360]   But Solar, Susan, and even Streetar, who is now taking--
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.480]   it sounds like he will be the sole person responsible for all
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.240]   of ads.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.480]   They're all fantastic people.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.960]   They're all data-driven.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.760]   And they're all extremely capable.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.520]   That's good.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:21.960]   Before--
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.240]   A bit redundant to Google, I think.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.080]   Well, there are some people without size personalities.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.840]   But for the most part--
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.040]   Oh, now we're going to get some juice.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.720]   That Larry Page guy, I tell you, he acts like CEO.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.480]   Who's put him in charge?
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.480]   We're going to get mad fired one way or the other.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.640]   No, we're not.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.320]   So we don't know what Kamengar will do, the former head of
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.240]   YouTube.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.480]   Susan Wojcikki was the head of ad sales at Google.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.480]   Yeah, it was a shared responsibility for ads between
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.440]   Susan Wojcikki and Streetar.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.600]   And so Streetar is doing all of ads, and Susan is going to
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.200]   take over YouTube, is what it sounds like from the public
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   report.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.920]   OK, she was senior vice president in charge of product
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.880]   management and engineering of advertising.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.040]   Of course, it was a good garage.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.640]   Well, that's the greatest story, right?
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:23.240]   Her mom's garage was where Google started.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.880]   In Menlo Park in 1998.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.440]   Mom is a magnificent journalism teacher at
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.000]   Palobalt O'Hai.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.160]   Such a great story.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.000]   See, now I don't feel so bad about being in my mom's
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.880]   basement.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.640]   And Anne, her sister, met Sergey Brin as a result of that,
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.280]   sharing the garage.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.200]   That's right.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.040]   It's a time-honored position.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.000]   Do you have a brother?
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.520]   Two.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.880]   Two.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.400]   I do.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.280]   Very interesting.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.760]   We'll get some people over there right away to start a
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.360]   search company or something.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:04.680]   OK, so that's like those are the big stories.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.600]   And I think there's not much to say at this point.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.960]   Well, and speaking of search companies, it's interesting
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.440]   that Satya Nadella is now the CEO of Microsoft.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.200]   And he started in Bing.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.360]   Back in 2008, he was at search conferences like SMX and
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.240]   Pubcon.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.400]   And then he went on to the server group at Microsoft.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.440]   So he ran R&D at Bing.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.640]   And that's actually in a way that's a big part of, I think,
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.440]   why he was able to become CEO is they needed somebody who had
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.920]   experienced in a broad range of areas.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.400]   And there was some-- he runs currently or did just until
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.800]   Tuesday, run cloud and enterprise for Microsoft.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.000]   But having had a little bit of techy experiences, R&D,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.440]   having had a little bit of consumer experience at Bing, I
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.120]   think made him the front runner, frankly.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.840]   I think it's a fascinating pick because a lot of the old
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.000]   guard at Microsoft might be more thinking it through a
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.080]   client PC sort of framework.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.760]   But Satya, he understands the cloud natively.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.960]   And I'm very curious to see what Microsoft does following
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.400]   that.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.800]   He has been very-- in his 22 years at Microsoft, very
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.160]   available to people.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.800]   Everybody's interviewed him, except me.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.280]   But everybody's interviewed him.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.400]   And has nothing but great things to say about him.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.280]   So we will watch with interest.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.560]   Do you think maybe that'll end the
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.680]   scruggled thing or that'll continue on?
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.840]   It sounds like Mark Penn is still--
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.200]   Mark Penn's right there.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.000]   Mark Penn, I saw him at Davos.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.360]   You did?
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.440]   Was he there?
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:36.960]   He was there.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.240]   Did you say hi?
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.640]   I wanted to go up.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.600]   I would know.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.880]   I wanted to have a smart ass thing to say, but I
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.880]   thought no, it's not worth it.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.280]   Scrading!
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.240]   If he manages to turn Microsoft into an
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.000]   internet company, that would be tremendous.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.920]   Well, so what he said at his Assessions speech, the
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.440]   first all hands meeting--
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.280]   we talked about this on Windows Weekly if you want to get
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.760]   more excessive detail--
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.160]   is software, software, software.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.680]   Innovation, innovation, innovation.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.640]   But that is an important maybe distinction between him and
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.720]   his successor Steve Palmer.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.600]   Because it was Palmer who began this transition to a
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.760]   devices and services company.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.560]   That doesn't sound like software, software.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.160]   In fact, sounds like hardware software.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.560]   And so he was at great pains to say, look, it all runs on
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.360]   software.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.760]   And in fact, Paul Therat and I came up with a new--
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.440]   because he'd go to the Microsoft web page that says
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.320]   software and devices and services.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.800]   And Paul and I said, you really got to name--
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.680]   rename that to--
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.200]   Microsoft makes the software that power the devices and
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.600]   services you use.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.520]   And that's probably more of the angle he's going to take.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.400]   And he is a techie.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.040]   He's a programmer.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.600]   But you know what?
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.200]   He has devices and services.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.160]   It sounds like operating systems though.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.160]   That's what it sounds like to me.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:03.880]   Yeah, that's the key.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:04.760]   Which isn't a bad thing.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.720]   But no, you know this.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.480]   Think up software?
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.320]   Yes.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.160]   But it's web software.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:09.920]   Like, that's different.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.480]   Microsoft's whole thing has been--
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.040]   this is a Windows Weekly and I don't really know what
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.680]   I'm talking about when it comes to Microsoft for sure.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.800]   But Microsoft is still Windows in Office, right?
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.080]   And I know there's a lot of cloud components to that.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.560]   But that feels tacked on.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.080]   You know?
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.280]   Even the same--
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.600]   Well, but that's what they're saying.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.280]   That's what they're saying.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.040]   We are not.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.320]   That's what devices and services, as their tagline says.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.360]   We were Office.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.800]   We were Windows.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.720]   We are now devices and services.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.560]   Even Windows and especially Office now
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.880]   is SAS software as a service.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.400]   You know what?
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.000]   I just realized recently that I don't
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.240]   use a single-- so for this moment when I'm on Skype,
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.360]   thanks to you, I don't use a single bit of Microsoft software.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.320]   Wow.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:48.880]   Nothing.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.320]   Wow.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.560]   And not because I'm anti-Microsoft or tried
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.160]   to stop using Microsoft or any of that.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.400]   It's thanks to my Chromebook Pixel.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.400]   You don't need to.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:58.920]   That's all I would.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.560]   But you know, what's interesting is you could use Microsoft Office
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.960]   on your Chromebook Pixel.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.600]   The web versions of those run quite well on Chrome.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.640]   But I don't need to now because I'm on Drive.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.200]   Right.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   Right.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.960]   And of course, Nadella ran Azure, ran the cloud services.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.960]   So he's very familiar with cloud.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.000]   I think this is part of the transition to the cloud,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   frankly.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.440]   But he's emphasizing--
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.840]   What would you say Microsoft's key skill is these days?
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.360]   Well, there was a really interesting point.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.440]   Whenever Satcha wrote his letter about who he was that is
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.160]   posted on the website, he mentioned
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.120]   that innovation, talent, all the right notes.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.880]   But he also mentioned perseverance.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.680]   And I think that's something that Microsoft really shines at
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.640]   compared to a lot of web-based companies that expect to just
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.440]   get a 10 times multiplier in one week.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.160]   And then you call it a day.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.080]   Microsoft realizes they need to sometimes show up,
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.600]   talk to the customers, grind things out, support things for
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.240]   years.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.680]   That's something they're really good at.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:09.560]   So he says it's an incredible honor for me to lead this company.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.560]   He mentions Bill Gates is going to come back as a support.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.120]   He says, while we've had great success, we are hungry to do
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:16.880]   more.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.560]   Our industry does not respect tradition.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.720]   It only respects innovation.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.920]   This is a critical time for the industry and for Microsoft.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.800]   Make no mistake, we are headed for greater places as
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.880]   technology evolves and we evolve with and ahead of it.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.680]   But as we start a new phase of our journey together, let's
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.000]   consider tradition.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.400]   Let's consider-- yeah, persistence is one way to say it, I
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.000]   guess.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   He says, this is a software-powered world.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.800]   I think that's also the correct way to look at it.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.480]   In fact, it may be it will respond a little bit to
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.440]   Microsoft's kind of failure in the hardware space.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.280]   Surface has been a little bit of a flop, certainly.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.600]   I still don't know what that means.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.360]   What software do we need them to do?
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.280]   Well, everything is software.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.720]   I mean, is it Andreece and who said software is eating the
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   world?
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.360]   So it sort of echoes that in a slightly different way.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.400]   But they still have to get--
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.520]   then if software is everything, then saying your
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.960]   software is saying nothing, you have to get down to decide
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.720]   what kind of software, where is your value?
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.000]   That's true.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.960]   Yeah, right.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.280]   And they have to make that shift from being the desktop PC,
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.600]   the company that builds software on, locally on devices,
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.400]   to being more web-centric.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.040]   And that's what I was saying earlier.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.680]   That's a really big cultural shift.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.520]   I think that companies that started after the web,
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.200]   started building for the web, or in the cloud, to begin with,
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.680]   it's in your DNA in a certain way that I don't think that
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.000]   necessarily is at Microsoft.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.560]   And if he can make that shift for them, that would be huge.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.040]   And I should say Microsoft R&D does some amazing, amazing,
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.040]   amazing things.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.920]   Photosynth, I mean, I've had a chance to see a couple of
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.520]   really neat things.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.400]   And I would just love to see them ship that stuff and get
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.200]   just more press for that stuff.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.800]   And you just don't hear about it as much as.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.320]   He very much acknowledges this.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.440]   He says, in our early-- this is also in his letter.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.120]   In our early history, our mission was about the PC on every
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.800]   desk and every home, a goal we have mostly achieved in the
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.680]   developed world.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.960]   Today, we're focused on a broader range of devices.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.520]   As we look forward, we must zero in on what Microsoft can
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.400]   uniquely contribute to the world.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.160]   We are the only ones who can harness the power of software
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.920]   and deliver it through devices and services that truly empower
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.240]   every individual and every organization.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.000]   So I think he's clearly positioning himself.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.280]   Where we really add value is in the software that goes through
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.720]   these devices and services.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.920]   So who is their primary competitor?
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.280]   Is it not Google now?
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.520]   Is it Apple?
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.560]   Is it--
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.920]   Well, and Apple's a very good example of a company that
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.480]   doesn't have the DNA to do cloud.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.440]   Is it Salesforce?
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440]   Clearly.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:56.720]   Right?
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.360]   Is it Salesforce?
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.240]   No.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.080]   I don't know.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.840]   Well, who's there-- yeah, who are they?
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:02.320]   Who are they?
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   No.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:02.840]   IBM.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.640]   Who do they go after?
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.480]   No, yeah, maybe.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.080]   Maybe you're right.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.360]   IBM.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.640]   Two old dinosaurs.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.840]   R. I don't know.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.800]   It's interesting because the competitor question is the good
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.400]   one to ask.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.960]   But I really like Gina's question about whether they make
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.240]   the transition to a web company.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.840]   And by web, it doesn't just mean devices like mobile or the
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.920]   cloud, which I do think they'll chase.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.960]   I think there's going to be a really interesting fork in
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.160]   the road because web companies are brought up to believe in
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.120]   interoperability and open standards and federated data
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.880]   and all this sort of thing.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.280]   Right on.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280]   Yes.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:34.880]   And it--
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.080]   I'll be very curious if Microsoft--
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.440]   which way they go on that fork?
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.840]   Because if they make a decision that says, you know what?
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.120]   You're not allowed to run Chrome on our latest operating
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.000]   system, then that's kind of the old Microsoft still poking
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.120]   through it.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.360]   You watch with interest.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.840]   You nailed it.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.600]   The bellwether will be, for instance, can Chrome ever be
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.160]   installed on RT?
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.880]   Or-- and this is the one we're watching with interest right
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.560]   now--
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.760]   how long before Office, which is admittedly a great,
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.240]   important product for Microsoft, appears on iOS and Android?
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.840]   And Skype on Chrome and so on.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.920]   I think your reference to IBM is right because the
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.160]   reinvention that IBM did of itself around open source and
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.680]   around services and other things is probably a good road map
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.120]   for what Microsoft needs to do now.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.320]   Yeah, they're very much like it.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.640]   Google had a good fourth quarter.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.960]   We'll talk about the results, find out what it all means
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.520]   in just a little bit.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:35.000]   There's also lots of news, including Jeff's new glasses.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.600]   Oh, I can't wait to hear about this.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.680]   Jeff, do you have them?
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.040]   Oh, I want to have this conversation.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.200]   But first, let's deviate a little bit and talk about
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.840]   personal capital.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.600]   This episode brought to you by Personal Capital.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.680]   Today, I want to share with you a free and I got to emphasize
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.120]   secure tool called Personal Capital that solves two barriers
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.920]   to building your net worth.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.280]   And let's face it, maybe you say, oh, that's not a goal of
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.320]   mind to build my net worth.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.080]   Look, someday you're going to have to retire and I wouldn't
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.320]   count on Social Security to keep you afloat.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.720]   You've got to build your net worth, at least, so that you
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.400]   can enjoy your life and your older age.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.120]   Trust me, I know.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.240]   First barrier, of course, in doing this is hard to keep
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.040]   track of your life as you get older.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.400]   Your life gets more complicated.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.400]   You've got mortgages.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.120]   You've got loans.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.960]   You've got credit cards, bank accounts.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.720]   One hopes you've got investments, 401ks, stock
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.480]   investments, all on different sites, different
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.880]   user names, different passwords.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.960]   And then, of course, you have to pay somebody to manage all
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.080]   of that stuff and you can really overpay on that and get
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.640]   kind of not such good advice either.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.760]   Personal capital solves this problem.

[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.160]   your computer, your phone, your tablet.

[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.640]   understand what you're looking at and then drill down to find
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.720]   out, am I overpaying in fees?
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.000]   How can I reduce those fees?
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.280]   What are some investments that are appropriate for my goals?
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.920]   It's really great and best of all, it's free.

[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.800]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   Google.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   All right, well, let's start with the glass.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.040]   I did see that NYPD is going to be testing glass.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.000]   That is not a good thing, I don't think.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   No, it's not because they add the new opportunities.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.200]   It's not that different from a dash cam.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.640]   Our cops are on the street.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.240]   It's a dash cam all the time.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.640]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.200]   I guess.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.160]   I guess so.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.280]   But anyway, they're not using them.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.520]   It's a trial run law enforcement officials said we signed up,
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.760]   got a few pair of the Google glasses.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.440]   We're trying them out, seeing if they have any value
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.760]   investigations, mostly for as you hypothesize patrol
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.600]   purposes.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.880]   We're looking at them, you know?
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.960]   See it out a week says a New York City law official.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.800]   Exactly like that.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.240]   Forget about it.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.600]   Forget about it.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.200]   You got a problem with that?
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.040]   So what's your problem, Mr. Jarvis?
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.400]   Well, all right, so here they are.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.440]   So I didn't mean to cause a kerfuffle,
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.440]   but business insider chose to write about my little Google
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.600]   Plus post and tweets last night.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.240]   And because I had gone after a business insider some time ago
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.320]   for dismissing glass off hands when I came up being critical
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:46.840]   of glass.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.320]   Ah, see, see.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.880]   We were right.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.080]   So here's the box, right?
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.240]   Oh, so these are the prescription glass glasses.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.360]   These are the prescription frames.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.240]   Now the problem is that I've had with glasses,
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.480]   I have to wear them over my glasses.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.080]   They don't really work.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.040]   So I really haven't been using them.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.600]   So I feel very impractical.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.520]   I'm 1,500 bucks in.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.800]   So then I get-- I think finally I can use glass prescription
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.520]   lens.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.040]   OK, fine.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.320]   So here is the case.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.240]   It's big enough to be a bum.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.680]   Put that in your back pocket, can't you?
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.520]   You've got to carry--
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.600]   You need to put glasses in your glasses.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.280]   So then you get this.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.480]   So then I open them up.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.840]   Here they are, right?
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.680]   OK, so they're fine.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.600]   So I'll take them off.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.800]   I'm on, I'm blind.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.960]   OK, so find the glasses.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.040]   But here's what gets--
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:32.600]   Where's glass?
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.240]   I don't see glass.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:33.600]   Nice.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.480]   Yeah, where's glass?
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.960]   I've got to send my first pair back
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.160]   to get the second pair to put on these,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.640]   because the first pair doesn't work on these, which
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.120]   is my first primary problem.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.960]   So I'm in-- I'm at 1,500 bucks for this for something
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.800]   that I really don't use, to be honest.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.320]   Google's out another 1,500 bucks,
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.400]   because they're not making profit on this.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.560]   It's probably that much.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.320]   In sitting with me in another pair, thank you very much.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.480]   But that's a lot of money.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.520]   These cost $200, with my old screwed up eyes,
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.560]   my lenses cost upwards of $300.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.520]   So all in, their money and my money,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.320]   we're talking about a $3,500 investment.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.400]   Oh my god, you could have bought a Mac Pro for that.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.720]   Well, yeah, or two Chromebooks.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.640]   And two pixels.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.960]   And two pixels, 10 Chromebooks.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.320]   10 Chromebooks.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.880]   And five golden rings.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:26.920]   And so that just started to really bother me.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.240]   But what got me last night, I guess, besides the Merlot,
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.400]   was--
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.360]   So you admit, you were a little toasted when you wrote this.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.840]   Run came to last week's.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.320]   It was fast.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   I talked to a nice guy from the Google team
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.400]   today named Chris Dale, and told him
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.240]   it was a little more low.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.240]   And I didn't intend to cause this fit.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   But what gets me is, if you can see here, this--
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   What is that point at the end there?
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.720]   It's a-- this is where you put the glass in,
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.520]   but it's a sharp edged thing.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.800]   So what hit me with the hubris, the design over functionality
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.280]   of this, is that I can't use--
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.080]   I'm just going to spend probably upwards of $600 on these glasses.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.760]   And you can't use them with that glass.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.720]   Or you could poke your eye out.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.220]   Right.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.400]   That's what they meant when they said
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.600]   that it doesn't work unless the electronics are attached.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.440]   So the arm isn't--
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.040]   That's ridiculous.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.480]   Plus, they don't end.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.000]   Right.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.080]   They're titanium fine.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.840]   And so they come with this huge fakak the case.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.280]   So I need to carry a briefcase to carry my glasses.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.800]   Now, the case is because you're going
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.680]   to put your Google Glass in there as well, right?
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.240]   Yeah, but still, they could have--
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.400]   what I said to them today was, the nice guy called me.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.520]   And he said, I just want your feedback for the team.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.080]   And I said, I'm happy to give it.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.640]   For what it's worth, and I didn't mean
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.320]   to cause a huge kerfuffle.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.800]   But my advice is, get this friggin thing
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.960]   to the market sooner than later.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.880]   This is design over market sense.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.520]   And the market is going to yell at you instead of just me
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.240]   yelling at you and say, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.760]   And they got to talk to-- they should have been talking
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.280]   to customers.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.680]   You know, I occurred to me that they should have
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.640]   been using Google Plus and the Glass groups there
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.360]   to say, all you blind bats using Google Glass,
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.200]   what would you like the glasses to be?
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.440]   They didn't use their most powerful tool, which
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.000]   is this incredible community of explorers
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.840]   they put around it and Google Plus to avoid what I think
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.320]   is a mistake.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   Danny Sullivan was rooting me on last night.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.360]   So he agrees.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.360]   And at some point, I just got offended
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.960]   by the total cost of something that is still a novelty.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.960]   I don't use very much.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.480]   I still salute them for making it.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.720]   I still say that Glass is to whatever follows what
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.840]   the Newton is to the smartphone.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.000]   This is an important advance.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.040]   I know it's a beta.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.360]   I know it's just a start.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.680]   Yes, I get sick of all the first world problem jokes
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.320]   on Google Plus.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.000]   But having said that, I don't know what to do now.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.160]   So I'm going to go to my optician
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.560]   and see what the lowest price is.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.040]   I can get for lenses for me.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.760]   But my lenses are really expensive
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.000]   because they've got five levels and all kinds of stuff.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.200]   And it's just really expensive.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.560]   Do you still want to-- you started your post saying,
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.560]   I want out.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.120]   Do you still want--
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.400]   I can't get out of Glass.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.080]   And so my point was, yes, I knew there
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.120]   was a 30-day return of the original Glass.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.680]   I almost returned, but I do that too often.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.160]   Don't I, Twig fans.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.720]   So I didn't.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.800]   And I kept them.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.920]   But now I'm going to go to Google.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.360]   And Google's going to send me another--
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.280]   they're out another 1,500 bucks.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.640]   And that actually just kind of bothers me
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.680]   for something I use that much.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.120]   And so then I'm out another 600 bucks on top of it
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.720]   for the total of frames and lenses.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.160]   And if I'm stuck with the Glass,
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.320]   I might go ahead and get this.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.600]   But then I have another problem, which is in my case--
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.160]   and this is unique to me--
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.800]   I want to use this in education.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.240]   But Glass is tied to my account.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.240]   And so I can't really pass the Glass.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.360]   And will soon be tied to my screwed-up prescription.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.560]   So I can't really pass them around in school.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.240]   So it becomes less and less useful to me
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.840]   and more and more kind of offensive.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.280]   I enjoyed having the first.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.320]   I enjoyed demonstrating them.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.000]   I've never worn them on the streets of New York
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.440]   because I think I'd look like a dork.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.320]   And they wouldn't work on top of my glasses,
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.760]   and I'd get hit by a car.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:04.000]   So if I go ahead and fill these with lenses and get Glass,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.320]   maybe it'll change my mind entirely.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.480]   But I just think the Glass ought to get in the marketplace
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.120]   and get to real consumers.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.000]   And I'll probably be a lot happier about whatever
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.520]   that product is than this sandbox and the spiel.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.720]   Well, I got him with you.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.200]   I didn't buy Glass in the first place,
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.000]   even though obviously I could have.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.480]   So good.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.120]   I paid for it and I gave him to Jason.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.840]   Actually, that's right.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.240]   I is worse than didn't buy him.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:27.920]   I did buy him.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.960]   I just didn't wear him.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.800]   Who are you?
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.080]   The arm not bending, while I appreciate it's
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.360]   clearly a difficult technical problem,
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.920]   it makes it really impractical.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.400]   That case is crazy.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.760]   But, Jeff, those lenses are really nice.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.040]   I mean, much nicer than the visor.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.200]   The original Explorer version visor, in my opinion,
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.400]   just from seeing you sort of hold them up.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.240]   And you haven't gotten the electronics yet.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.080]   So you haven't even gotten a chance to wear those, right?
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.520]   But you're going to.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.880]   You need to swap in the new version
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.920]   and then you need to get your lenses.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.040]   You know what the lenses that help you see.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.600]   These glasses are nice if I could wear them with and without glass.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.440]   I might actually wear them.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.880]   That's part of my point is that I don't go off
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.120]   and spend $600 on glasses just to wear,
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.200]   occasionally, when I'm going to be a geek.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.040]   Neither am I.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.640]   I'm not going to wear glass all the time.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.760]   You don't wear glass all the time.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.200]   But no, no, I don't.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.760]   And I have to tell you, what I saw--
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.600]   So I have these two frames.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.560]   I saw the bit that said these frames won't
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.000]   work unless glass is attached.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.200]   And that was a little bit of a red flag.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.440]   I was like, wait a second.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.240]   Because, look, if you're going to spend the money
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.040]   on your prescription lenses and the frames,
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.200]   then you should be able to--
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.320]   I mean, I would love it if you could snap the electronics
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.920]   on and off, particularly for some of the wore glasses.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.360]   Or for that matter, to put a little--
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.880]   give me as an add-on a little plastic thing
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.840]   to cut this sharp thing so it doesn't cut into my skin.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.440]   So if I go to the effort of taking them off,
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.000]   I can still use these as $600 glasses.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.640]   That would be helpful.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.480]   Just something, you know, a little plastic form of piece
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.840]   that would let you use it dual use.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.960]   That would be nice.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.680]   Somebody's got a MakerBot somewhere
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.960]   that can print one of those out for you.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.960]   That's like, yeah, exactly.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.840]   That's definitely going to happen.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.560]   But yeah, I mean, I agree.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.720]   So I hear where you're coming from,
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.160]   but I also kind of feel like you kind of knew
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.240]   what you were getting into.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.880]   But I also want to hear your review once you get the whole setup
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.720]   on your head.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.960]   So you're telling me-- you're costing me another $700.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.560]   So wait, so you're--
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.160]   You're shaming me and spending another $700.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.360]   So wait, you paid for the frames and you paid for the electronics.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.600]   So the other 700 are the lenses for you?
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.880]   Well, the lenses for me-- this is $250 for the frame.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.120]   $200 a quarter for the frame.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.160]   Well, the frame does include the lenses?
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:45.680]   Of course not.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.320]   Of course not.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.800]   Because I got to give my special lenses.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.280]   I've got, you know, trifocal--
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   Wow.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.280]   --you.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.800]   I didn't realize that.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.880]   So the $250 is not for glasses plus lenses.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.400]   That's not--
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.840]   It's just for the frames.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.160]   OK.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.640]   That's the cost of these frames, which are these
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.040]   are very nice frames, right?
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.160]   And frames are expensive.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.760]   But that seems a little high on it.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.600]   It's cost as a rule.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.840]   Upwards of $300.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.400]   And I can only use those lenses when
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.640]   geeking out with glass.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.000]   That's the part that just made me say, oh, geez, really?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.280]   Hi, here.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.320]   That's all.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.800]   I didn't mean to cause a big fit.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.880]   I really didn't.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.720]   No, but it's good.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.360]   I think it was good for-- you were a little bit
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.240]   the canary in the coal mine.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.600]   I think it's good to realize--
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.960]   They were very good at asking that.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.080]   You know, I gave them earnest advice and said, you know,
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.200]   get this sucker to market because the real market is
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.560]   going to tell you better than I will.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.120]   I think this was a designer not being forced to deal
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.440]   with real customers.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.280]   And Google-- the point of the Explorer program
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.000]   is that Google has real customers.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.200]   Crazy first adopters, nicer customers.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.840]   I think they've done a better job of using that.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.000]   The original rumor was that we were
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.560]   going to go with Warby Parker to do it.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.200]   And Warby Parker has equivalently nice lenses, glasses,
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.840]   for like $90.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.920]   So I don't--
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.400]   That's true.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.160]   That's a lot cheaper.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.640]   My optician hates people going to Warby Parker.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.840]   Because he makes profit on the frame.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.760]   Where you go to 800 contact lenses, 800 contact-- whatever
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.360]   it is.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.520]   Because that-- no, they don't.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.040]   So that's why their services are going up.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:21.000]   Let me search on Warby for some titanium frames for you.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.520]   And just see what they have.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.800]   Because I think that they're like 100 bucks.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.440]   Really?
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.200]   These are nice and light.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.640]   I would have expected Google to say to this guy, hey, look,
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.880]   we're going to give you some profit,
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.600]   but you shouldn't charge more than cost on these.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.880]   You shouldn't make the usual--
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.040]   Well, it's a titanium markup.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.520]   --or cheap.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.920]   I mean, these frames, these are the plastic-y bending ones,
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.640]   which I like quite a bit.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   They're like the titanium ones I had.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.880]   Very, very light, extremely light.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.880]   These cost $250, $300.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.200]   Well, yeah.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.000]   But you're overpaying because LaXodica has this monopoly.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.440]   Exactly.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.520]   Warby charges 100, including lenses.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.560]   No, including lenses?
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.360]   No, they don't give you lenses.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.400]   They just sell the frames.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.160]   No.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.240]   You send them your prescription.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   They put your lenses in.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   Really?
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:07.760]   Really?
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.240]   No.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.440]   I'm really feeling like you're playing
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.120]   LaXodica prices when you pay 250 bucks.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.040]   He's a nice guy.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:14.920]   He's in the town.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.680]   I support local business.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.680]   I support Google.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.680]   Like, here are the Marlows.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.120]   OK, these are $145.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.760]   It's copper, not titanium.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.720]   And that includes prescription lenses
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.080]   with anti-reflecting coating.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.840]   You get a nice box and white barag, too.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.240]   OK, no problem.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:41.960]   Google sent me-- OK, so I got a white barag, a glass white barag.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.040]   Oh, that's worth $50, at least.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.440]   Extra nose pads.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.400]   Oh, you don't get extra nose pads from Warby.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.520]   No, and somewhere--
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.760]   Here's-- these are platinum.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.360]   Rush platinum.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.360]   $145.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.360]   That's cool.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.880]   That looks as good as titanium.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.920]   And here's a nice selling point.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.240]   It doesn't have a pointy eye poker on one of the side of the--
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.240]   --table.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.240]   An eye poker.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.600]   Special eye poking unit.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.800]   Well, no, I'm in trouble.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.240]   I can't find-- they sent a little screwdriver.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.240]   I can't--
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.680]   You lost the screwdriver.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.760]   Oh, no, here it is.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.840]   Yeah, so I also got a little--
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.160]   It's a Pentaloob.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.480]   A little tiny screwdriver.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.160]   OK, so if you have tri-focals, they
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   tell me that you have to--
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.600]   Warby won't do those, so--
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   Why you see exactly?
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.600]   I have progressive tri-focals as well.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   Or not the--
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   Not the image is a terrible thing.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   Infinite folk at that.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   Don't get old.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   Don't get old.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:45.880]   Fourth quarter results for Google and fiscal year results for 2013 coming up in just a bit.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.360]   I'm being scottish.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   Scottish?
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.360]   That's right.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.960]   Because it's all about saving money.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.200]   Google's going to do a stock split.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.280]   Are you happy about that?
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.000]   I don't mind that.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.040]   You know, it doesn't mean anything right because the value of your stock does not change.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.160]   One width, you just have more shares for the same amount.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.680]   Is it a more shares or is it a different kind of shares?
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.680]   Stock split.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:16.440]   It is a-- you get a dividend, which is technically a class C share, which is basically the same
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.480]   as a regular share.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.000]   So it's basically almost exactly like a two to one stock split.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Oh, I see.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   And at least exactly right.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.880]   Mathematically, it means nothing.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.040]   It's just psychologically stocks tend to go up after a split, which is very weird.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.040]   There's no--
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.640]   Well, because the price of a single share is lower.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.760]   So I can buy one now.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.800]   Google's stock being well over $1,000 for one share.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   I couldn't afford one.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.200]   It might be more of a factor.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.680]   But you need any evidence that stock markets are not really--
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.960]   Now, it is interesting that these are non-voting shares you'll be--
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.040]   New shares are non-voting.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:59.000]   So you retain your single class A share and you get a second class C share, which is non-voting.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.360]   I guess that's not unusual.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   That means that they don't want to double your vote.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.920]   So that makes sense.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:09.880]   Well, there's a third part of the split, which is Sergey and Larry hold on to superboarding
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   shares.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.680]   They get 10 times V shares, which are really good.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.480]   Like 10 times to one or two.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.040]   Yep, 10 times more than the class A shares.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.040]   But you know what?
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.040]   That's great.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.640]   The shares should retain control of the company.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.880]   You don't really don't want--
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:31.760]   a Carl Icahn to come along by 1% of your stock and suddenly change the company's direction.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.120]   They were very clear in the founders' letter that they were going to try crazy things.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.000]   And if you don't like that, don't buy Google's shares.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.720]   So it seems like--
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.320]   Read the disclaimer before you buy Google is the high order.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.600]   It also is important to you, Matt, because having this non-voting stock means they can
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:54.240]   give out more stock to employees without diluting Larry and Sergey.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:59.760]   So the part of this is about getting-- and this is really the currency in Silicon Valley.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.320]   It's not just a salary.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.200]   It's how much stock am I going to get?
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   So having more stock available to give employees is very important.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.320]   That's some question.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.960]   More shares, same price.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.040]   That means that the company was valuation.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.040]   The price drops.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.040]   Okay.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.080]   The price-- basically think of it twice as many shares and the price drops in half.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:27.760]   So if you have 100 shares worth $1,000, you'll have 200 shares worth $500.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.760]   Gotcha.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.760]   Gotcha.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.240]   And full disclosure, I own some Google stock.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.960]   Well you're going to have twice as many shares.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:42.600]   But not twice the votes or twice the dollars.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.160]   We have the twig vote.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.160]   That's right.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.160]   That's true.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.440]   The twig vote is probably more important than the share vote.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.040]   No, I'm serious.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:58.400]   So I was running, I was jogging, and I hadn't listened to last week's This Week in Google.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.960]   And so I was listening to it yesterday.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.920]   And I don't remember exactly what the subject was.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:07.320]   All I remember is at an hour and 39 minutes in, I have to go and find that podcast again
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   and report a bug.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.320]   Oh my God.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.320]   Wow.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.320]   Wow.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   Well, I think it was Leo LaPorte.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.360]   I think it was your Audi, the Google Earth--
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.120]   Yeah, but that's not your fault.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.080]   Well, no, but it's a fair bug report.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.920]   Like, hey, you sent us through a lake, you know, or whatever.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.080]   Yeah, I mean, it does use Google Earth, but I think Google Earth is not the fault here
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.680]   that the Audi is saying to Google Earth, he is in Bodega Bay right now.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.280]   What's that look like?
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.920]   And then all Google Earth does is say, well, if he's in Bodega Bay, he's going to see the
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.600]   continental shelf from here.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:43.640]   It's the funniest thing to drive on the continental shelf, I got to tell you.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.080]   So basically, you know, reports and bug reports via Twig.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.080]   Thank you.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.080]   Thank you.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.080]   Good outside.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.080]   So if they carry a fair amount--
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.520]   From now on, we should have a little bell or something that we ring when it's for Matt
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.520]   Cut's attention.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:59.680]   Well, I think Jeff's rant clearly got, you know, people's attention even before it
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.680]   started.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.880]   Well, yeah, sorry.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.520]   There was somebody in the chat room who was like, we should have a section called Jeff's
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.200]   rant of the day or something like that.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   So that was on my mind.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   It's been done.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   Right.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   It's been done.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   We--
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.320]   We've been others.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.240]   We don't need no stinking rants.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:25.840]   I think I have a picture of me in the-- let me just look through my Google+ photos.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.640]   I've been taking some of the more interesting pictures.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:36.120]   Yeah, here I am driving down what looks like a typical California street.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.480]   But according to Google Maps, I'm just off the coast of Sea Ranch.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.240]   But if you pulled out your phone--
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.840]   Oh, the phone would be fine.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.040]   Yeah, the phone would be fine.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.640]   Yeah, that's a car bug.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.640]   That's a bug.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:53.560]   By the way, apparently not only did Matt Cut's truncate his run during this podcast, but somebody
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.320]   had out he did because I got a call from the dealer shortly thereafter saying, "AudiAmerica
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.120]   wants us to fix your car."
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.200]   Wow, the street vote.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.000]   Yes.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.240]   It's probably a little screw.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   You can use a little screwdriver to twist the GPS coordinates.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.520]   Actually, of course, there is a screw and they fixed it once.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.520]   I brought it in.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.520]   They said, "Oh, yeah, we'll reset that."
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.640]   They reset it and it worked for a day.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:24.360]   Then I sent them this picture saying, "You fixed it, sort of."
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.360]   Sort of.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.000]   Well, you know what's nice about having Google Earth in your car GPS?
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.280]   You get some vivid views of where you aren't.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:37.320]   You know you're in trouble when it says, because you know it gives a credit on the Google
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:42.800]   Earth to where the satellite photos came from when your credit is the United States Department
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.200]   of Agriculture.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.560]   That's when you know, and it literally is.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:51.920]   Then this one is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and the US Navy.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.160]   You know what happened to me, Leo?
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.960]   I would get fear of that.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.360]   When I go over, honest to God, you know my bridge problem?
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:09.320]   When I go over bridges and I have my phone with ways on it and I see blue on the phone,
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.040]   I get nervous and I turn on the bridge.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.520]   I'm on the bridge.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.720]   So on your car, I'd be driving on the street and that's something that gets what he pumps.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   I'm literally four miles out to sea.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.280]   I don't think there's a bridge out here.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:26.760]   You know what, actually, this is cool because you turn the knob on it and you can zoom in.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.440]   I've zoomed out to a four mile scub.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.840]   You can zoom in and you tap the knob.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.520]   If you zoom in to the 30 meters level and then you tap the knob, you get street view
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.920]   as you're driving down the street.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.240]   I can submarine you.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.960]   It's so weird to get street view of where you are.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.480]   You see the fishes?
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.880]   Well, I don't know what happens in the water, but you can see there.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.320]   I'm actually getting the topographic oceanic topographic map.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.320]   Oh, man.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.960]   Courtesy of Noah in the US Navy.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.360]   Yeah, we're going to sub out there somewhere.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.360]   It's fun.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.760]   I love bug reports on the show.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.200]   So we'll get to the court.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.680]   Well, let's do the quarterly results right now.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:15.100]   Consolidated revenues of survey says $16.86 billion for the quarter ending December 31st.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.160]   That's up 17% year over year.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.160]   Nice.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.560]   Disappointed some flow.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:26.360]   Well, just don't listen to stock market.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.880]   Traffic acquisition costs.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.880]   That is what?
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.840]   The cost of getting people to use Google, I guess.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.320]   That's marketing.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.440]   Or payouts to partners, for example.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.680]   Oh, I see.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.680]   Okay.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.360]   Like Wikipedia or stuff like that.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.000]   24% of revenue, $3.31 billion.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Wow.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.560]   Or like AOL, you know.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   Okay.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.480]   Acquisition costs.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.240]   Ad sense is going down.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:02.880]   It's getting weaker, which is probably a commentary on competitive things like programmatic buying
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.400]   and other things on websites out there.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.960]   But that's a concern.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.960]   Net income was good.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:14.640]   And using the GAP method, $3.38 billion up considerably from $2.89 billion a year to
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.200]   year.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.080]   And they just saved a $5 billion EU fine.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.080]   So that's good.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.080]   Yes.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.080]   Yes.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.920]   So all in all, a good quarter for Google.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.920]   Now mobile would be one of the things to watch carefully, right?
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.920]   Mobile revenues.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.120]   And this was one of the things that surprised me with Facebook's quarterly results, that
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:40.000]   that mobile suddenly, they flipped it, was more important than desktop revenue.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.120]   Google a little soft, I think, on mobile revenues still.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.960]   And Facebook has been surprising on mobile.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.320]   I'm not sure exactly why that's.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.560]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.120]   That's a big deal.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.680]   Just looking through these numbers.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:04.760]   So Apple's effective tax rate was 20, I think 22, 24%, Google's effective tax rate, 16%.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.400]   So good job on the accountants there.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.200]   That's thanks to the Irish reach around.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.200]   Cash assets.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:19.000]   No, Dutch sandwich in the Irish, whatever.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.040]   Loop, loop, loop.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.680]   Here is the term I don't remember.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.800]   I prefer reach around anyway.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.840]   The cash, cash holding is $58.72 billion.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.760]   A lot less than Apple, but not, not Chabby.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   Not Chabby.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.320]   47,756 full-time employees.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.880]   About almost 4,000 Motorola.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.160]   So those will be disappearing.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.480]   Although, that might take a while, incidentally.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:51.640]   That's got to be approved not only by US regulators, but Chinese regulators for Lenovo.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:57.800]   So mobile struggles continue, but revenue and profit up.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.800]   Mobile's tough.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.880]   It's a tough nut to crack.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.760]   But you've got to crack it because if you can't get mobile advertising to work, you don't
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.760]   have much future.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:11.040]   Well, my contention has been that mobile is not as simple as just putting ads on here.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.120]   The mobile strategy, and I've said this on the show many, many times, is that Google
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.520]   is in the signal industry.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.520]   And that--
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.520]   Absolutely.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.520]   This generates signals for Google that Google uses across all the lines of parts of the
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.520]   relationship.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.720]   So it's not directly attributable.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.400]   The value of mobile to Google is not directly attributable to the banner ad sold.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.280]   In fact, really, yeah.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.320]   If you think Google is an advertising company, this is very important.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.960]   But really, I think it's become clear.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.280]   Google is not an advertising company.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.560]   It's a data company, data driven, data collection, data-- what can we do with data, what can
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.120]   data do for us?
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.480]   And so this is-- yeah, they're getting the mobile signal.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.200]   That's a valuable piece of information, even if you can't monetize it immediately.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.040]   Nevertheless, you still have to figure out how to monetize mobile.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.040]   True.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.360]   But I think we're also pretty well positioned.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:03.560]   It's kind of funny because if you go back six years ago, the bet on Android was a pretty
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.560]   big bet.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.480]   And not every company bet on mobile the way that Google did.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.560]   And they've benefited.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:14.400]   But I remember in the early, early days of Google, everybody thought cell phones and
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.880]   wireless would take off and WAP and WML and all this.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.880]   >> Yeah, WAP.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:24.240]   >> And so I remember when Google's mobile strategy was half of one engineer's time.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.240]   >> Right.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:30.440]   >> And it really took smartphones and give Apple a lot of credit for opening up those
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:35.920]   new VISTAs because a lot of companies just didn't see mobile come in at all.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.000]   And I think it's interesting to see how many companies are now shifting to, okay, we have
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.600]   to go mobile first.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:43.600]   >> Hopefully Google will adapt well with that.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:48.320]   >> Well, on Facebook with their new paper app, really has shown that they've kind of
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.360]   no found the way to success in mobile.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:55.280]   Admittedly, paper has no ads yet, but it's really beautiful.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.720]   And it really is a better, frankly, a better Facebook experience than anywhere else, including
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.880]   the desktop.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:07.000]   >> The issue I don't have iOS is I just don't know I've got to drag out an iPhone and play
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   with it.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.840]   Paper is a subset of Facebook or it is a new skin to all of Facebook.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.280]   >> So my desk chat, if you want to go get it.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:22.800]   So it is a mobile app designed kind of as a skunk works.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:29.080]   And Facebook brought in really good designers like Lauren Brickter, we've talked about before,
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:39.800]   like Madison, and then what they said in effect was start from scratch to design a new app.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.120]   Ostensibly it's a news app.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.720]   It's more like a competitive flip board.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.440]   I'm running on an iPad by the way, but it is not an iPad app.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.720]   It's an iPhone app, but you can see it better on an iPad.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.040]   So this is the interface.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.440]   There's kind of two rows here.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.880]   The top row I could choose content.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.840]   So I'm seeing my Facebook content here in the bottom row, but I can also go more like
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.160]   a newspaper to news headlines.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.200]   I've chosen the categories.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.720]   You could choose your categories.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.640]   I use news tech scores.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.520]   They're sports category.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.680]   So you see as I change cooking.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.400]   >> So compare this to rich Twitter, this is a lot richer.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.240]   >> It's gorgeous.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:20.240]   So exposure is a good one because these are pictures, right?
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:25.720]   So down here, these are not my Facebook friends.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.800]   These are major content players and images from them.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.560]   Now wait, I mean, look how gorgeous this is.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.720]   It's still Facebook content.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.720]   I can like it.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.720]   I can comment it.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.880]   I can reshare it on my timeline.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:42.440]   It does this kind of beautiful, kind of parallax thing with it.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.360]   I can scroll down.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.720]   There's a lot of scrolling involved.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.080]   When I go back to, are you playing with this, Gina?
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.760]   Do you have an iPhone?
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.760]   >> I don't.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.640]   I actually haven't had a chance to look at this.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:54.640]   So I appreciate you doing that.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.640]   So this is my Facebook.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.280]   This would be my timeline on Facebook.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.960]   These are all Facebook friends.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.320]   So these are all things that would appear in the timeline.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:08.120]   But even when they share something, it's kind of more beautiful than it would be on, like
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:12.840]   for instance, Ryan Shroud of PC perspective shared a picture, a layer of ice on the sidewalk
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.680]   as office.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.280]   And that's a big deal because he lives in Kentucky.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.120]   Look how they move it around and stuff.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.040]   And it's very tactile.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.200]   I think they've done a great job with this.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.280]   It still is Facebook-y.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.360]   If I pull down, I get all of the same things I get in the Facebook app, including actually
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:42.080]   if I pull down and go to settings, I keep getting its settings, then I have much of the
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.360]   same kind of collection of settings, including things like the app did like the code generator,
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.640]   which is kind of very...
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.680]   This replaces the Facebook app, I think, in terms of full functionality.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.720]   And I still have friends and I have comments and I have...
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.000]   That's a fascinating thing to do too.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.520]   Now that I understand, thank you, Leo, is also using your service as an API.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.760]   Because now I have content in here that is not Facebook content.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.760]   And I can't remember.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.120]   Oh, there, that's how I scroll through it.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.400]   They have a very good...
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.760]   I didn't pay attention to the tutorial and I should have.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.680]   When you first start off, it talks to you, shows you pop-ups, explains how to use it.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.160]   And if I paid any attention, I would...
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.400]   If it needs a tutorial, dot, dot, dot.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.840]   It kind of does because it's pretty intuitive, but it is all swipey.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.200]   There's no menus, there's no...
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.720]   This is the new thing, right?
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   Swipe.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.600]   Try it and try swiping, see what happens.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.600]   Kind of a thing.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.600]   But you know what?
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.240]   Facebook's never done a good mobile app.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.400]   This is gorgeous.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:44.080]   I'd love to be one of...
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.080]   Yeah, it's pretty.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:48.160]   The panning in the big images reminds me a little bit of Facebook Home.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.160]   Yes.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.440]   It's Facebook Home, but it doesn't take over the launcher, right?
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.440]   It's just an app.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.440]   Right, right.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.440]   It's just...
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.920]   I've never gotten into the Flipboard magazine type media apps.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.520]   Personally, I know a lot of people really love them.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:09.320]   I'm never in this part of me, just being busy and being a new parent and all those things.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.160]   But I never need something to read.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.800]   I always feel like I've got this pile of things that I'm behind on reading.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.840]   So I would go for InstaPaper before I would...
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.840]   By the way...
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.720]   And this is the first time I can remember Facebook doing this.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.240]   This supports InstaPaper.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.720]   Oh, really?
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:30.600]   So in the settings, you can select a read later.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.600]   Service.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.600]   Oh, nice.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.880]   It's got Pocket, Pinboard, Safari, Reading List.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.880]   Wow.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.880]   Safari, Reading List.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:37.880]   Well, you're on that.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.960]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:44.880]   So what I use, Gina, I use Play Newsstand more than I would have thought.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:45.880]   Really?
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.880]   So you subscribe to...
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   I don't subscribe to anything.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.440]   No, I don't pay for anything.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.840]   What do you use it for?
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.840]   Oh, I read...
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:54.840]   I read Vir...
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.360]   You know, it's a way that I can quickly see Virge and Daily Beast and then Gadget and
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.760]   Gizmodo without going to all their sites.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.760]   Right.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.760]   Right.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.760]   Well, that's...
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:06.520]   Yeah, and if I were the Virge and others, I would worry a little bit about that.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.520]   Same with Flipboard.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.520]   Same exact issue with Flipboard.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.520]   Right.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.120]   What you have to do, I think, is we have to start building the business model in.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   Right.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:17.400]   I've talked on the show before about Reposts on us, how it makes articles embeddable like
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:23.040]   YouTube videos with the business model, brand, revenue, analytics, and links all built in.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.840]   So I'm going to be a mountain view.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.000]   By the way, Matt, I'll say hello next Friday.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.840]   And when I talk to Google+ people, I constantly wish that we could embed entire articles into
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:37.520]   Google+, with brand, revenue, analytics, and links attached.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.960]   Then publishers would look upon it as a friendly thing to be there because they could get,
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.800]   you know, new audience and new advertising opportunities.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:48.800]   And so I think that content has to travel with its business model, it has to travel with
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.600]   its credit, credit right versus copyright.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.080]   We have to rethink how that happens.
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:55:00.520]   And then you can enable things like Facebook, paper, and Flipboard to be beneficial because
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.240]   the reader likes them and the publisher gets something out of it.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.480]   But we haven't thought that far ahead.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.520]   We keep on saying, "No, you have to come to our site."
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.880]   So this came up because you're talking about mobile revenues.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:14.240]   And I think the big issue with mobile revenues isn't so much that people aren't clicking
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:17.160]   on the ads, or maybe it is, but the ad rates are going down.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:23.400]   Both YouTube and mobile ads are making less money through advertising because the rates
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.320]   have gone down.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.360]   So that's a cause for concern.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:32.040]   And I think that's saying advertisers saying these don't work.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:38.120]   So really the issue is coming up with ways to monetize mobile that work for advertisers.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.320]   And they have to work for consumers.
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:45.200]   One of the reasons they don't work is because consumers don't like them.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.200]   Let's take a break.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.840]   When we come back lots more, we get the change log from Gina to panic gear up there.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:54.400]   Go over to that encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.200]   Look up a good article for us.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.960]   There's no Google on Britannica.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:02.480]   What if you look under G, you don't see Google, huh?
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.040]   The internet is my encyclopedia.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.040]   The internet, yeah.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.040]   The web.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.160]   We were talking about this before the show.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.560]   I have in my office a world book encyclopedia from 1998.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:16.160]   At least your Britannica was from an era when encyclopedia has made sense.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:21.800]   I did book reports and school reports using these encyclopedia when I was like in fourth
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   grade.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.040]   I bought the leather bound guilt pages.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.720]   All this beautiful world book.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:31.160]   Because I thought, oh, my kids will really cherish this throughout their high school years.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.160]   Thank you.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.400]   And now it's a good, really good monitor or like laptop stand.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.920]   Yeah, they put their stuff on it.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.120]   Actually, the reason it's at my office is because I found it and my Oxford English Dictionary
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:46.440]   on the ground, on the floor in the garage where they had been moved because nobody was
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.440]   ever looking at them.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.040]   Now, dictionary is a different thing.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:53.120]   I still am hanging on to my paper dictionary.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.880]   Oh, no, but you don't understand.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.240]   It's the Oxford English Dictionary.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.560]   It's 20 volumes.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.560]   It's bigger.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.680]   It's bigger than the world book.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:02.920]   It's huge.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.440]   And they were all sitting on the garage.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:09.240]   I went, I was like, I'm coming ways Elizabeth.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.240]   I was anyway.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.480]   Oh my God.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:19.200]   This episode of Twig brought to you by legal zoom.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.200]   Legal zoom.

[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.960]   Delaware, California, what are the pros and cons of incorporating in each state?
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:15.080]   For instance, that was the question I had from wills to business formations.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:19.480]   They do trademarks, powers of attorney and more.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:21.120]   You know, I mentioned this.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.600]   I'm a big believer in having a healthcare power attorney.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.760]   They'll do that.

[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:37.400]   The Google wallet app for Android and iOS got some updates this week.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:42.400]   You can now scan in your loyalty cards and Google will push the wallet app will push

[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:51.960]   You just take a photo of your card with the device and the loyalty program information
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.320]   will just auto update in your wallet app.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:59.960]   And then if you, you know, walk by the CVS or whatever, you'll get a little push notification

[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:09.440]   Google maps app also got an update this week for iOS.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.120]   It's constantly looking for faster routes.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.880]   So as you, as you're driving, if traffic conditions change or something changes and
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.800]   there's a faster route when you go, you know, where to where you're going, the maps app
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.480]   will, will show you a little update and, and let you know, hey, here's a faster way to
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.480]   get here.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.120]   You see a screenshot of that right there.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120]   That's nice.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:33.040]   Uh, there's a brand new Nexus five available.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.080]   It is a very bright red.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.920]   Now, is it product red or is it just red red?
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.560]   It's, it's red, bright red.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.040]   It's extremely red.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.200]   It's actually so mad.
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.200]   The name is so red.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.200]   The name is bright red.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.200]   Yes.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:54.320]   Uh, it is a entirely red back and a black front and even, but the front ear speaker has
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320]   a little, a little red.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.040]   You've got a little red dot on the front.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.680]   Uh, the specs are exactly the same as the black and white models.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.880]   The pricing is the same too.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.720]   It's three 49 for 16 gig and three 99 for a 32 gig.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.560]   And it's in the play store right now shipping in stock, shipping one to two business days.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.440]   I just tell you, that's like really good looking phone.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.240]   I, I kind of pause.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.240]   It's a little too crazy for me.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.280]   Like I don't want to, you know, it says, it says here I am.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.280]   You're still me.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   It's still, it's still red.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.280]   I'm just so, if it's true that they're, they're, they're phasing out Nexus, I'm going
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.120]   to be so upset because I do, I do love my Nexus things.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.720]   Even if I have, I really believe it's true.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.720]   I love my next.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.720]   I believe it's true.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.480]   I, but, uh, so Leo, what makes, what makes you think that's true?
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.480]   Where are you?
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.040]   Here's my thinking.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.440]   I have a big elaborate story you might, you might imagine.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.320]   And we'll get back to the change log on a second.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.840]   Sorry, I didn't mean to derail.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840]   No problem.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.840]   No, no, I want to hear the elaborate story.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.280]   A big elaborate conspiracy story.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.560]   So Google does a little thinking.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.560]   They bought Motorola.
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.640]   By the way, I'm sad about that because I love Moto X.
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.280]   That's the phone I carry and I just got wood and I love it.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.360]   Oh, look at that.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:03.720]   And by the way, this was less than an Xs 32 gigs for 350 because they had that sale on
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.440]   Monday the day before they announced their selling it.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.440]   Okay.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.440]   It's going to take a while.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.440]   I don't know.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.320]   I'm sure Lenovo, I think Lenovo is a good company.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.360]   I'm sure that they will see the value in this.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:17.000]   In fact, you take it back to put the Chinese, uh, this is by wearing it.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   That's okay.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   That's fine.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   I don't mind.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.600]   Uh, believe me, my life, nothing to follow here.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.200]   It's keep moving.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.800]   But what I do hope is that Lenovo put a higher red screen and so forth.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.400]   And I believe it when Larry Page said, look, we couldn't go all in on phones and mobile's
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.400]   one of those areas.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.920]   You got to go all in on.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.960]   But here's what I really think between the lines, what he's saying is we're not, we shouldn't
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.080]   be selling phones.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.440]   This is a channel conflict because we make money, not on the phones, clearly not on
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.040]   Motorola phones.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.640]   We make money on Android.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.960]   We want people to use Android.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.520]   We want people to use Google apps and we don't care if we make the phone or not.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:00.720]   So why are we pissing off Samsung chiefly, but every other Android handset manufacturer,
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.480]   pushing them to create their own operating systems like Tizen or to hide the Android
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:12.240]   operating system and to take Google apps off like Amazon, we should be, we should be,
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.440]   it should be friendly, not a, you know, a competition.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.600]   So by selling handsets, we're, we're getting in their cheese.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.760]   Let's get out of their, get out of their way.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.000]   Let's let Lenovo sell handsets.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.040]   It's nice because it brings another manufacturer with a lot of clout, a lot of class into the
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:31.200]   United States and Western Europe where Lenovo isn't, but wants to be.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.920]   It's good for Android and interesting.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.680]   I don't know if it's a coincidence at the same time they announced a side deal with Samsung
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:44.560]   aid to stop suing each other, but be it's for Samsung to stop crapping up its versions
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.400]   of Android to not only put less crap, we're on there, but to make sure the crap was uninstolable.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.480]   So end users don't have to live with it.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.840]   This also has something to do with the fact that the South Korean government passed a
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.400]   law to the same effect.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.760]   But I think they made the agreement with Google as well.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.520]   And I think that that's Samsung saying to Google, okay, you're getting out of our business.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520]   You're not going to compete with us.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.520]   That's nice.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:07.320]   We can work something out.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.080]   And I think a part of the deal was, oh, and we won't make Nexus phones or tablets anymore
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.080]   either.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.240]   Now they never really made them.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:19.800]   The Nexus 5 is made by LG, but it, but it's to Google specification and it's sold on Google
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   store.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.520]   So what they said is, no, hey, we don't need to make Nexus phones.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.360]   We'll do Google Play editions.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.080]   You want to make a Galaxy S4 play edition, Galaxy S5 play edition, Galaxy Note 3 play
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:33.040]   edition, HTC One play edition, a Moto X play edition, whatever.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.040]   Right.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.880]   We'll sell it, but it's your phone and you make the profit.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:43.680]   All of that is Google's way of, I think, saying, well, first of all, I think probably
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.520]   buying Motorola, they knew this going in.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:51.920]   This was all a very cagey chess move by Larry Page to get these concessions out of these
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:58.080]   companies to get the patents, which noticed they kept, and they were able to sell off
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:02.160]   enough of it to, I don't think they even lost any money on the whole thing because they sold
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   off the set top box division and everything.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.040]   So I think this was actually very cagey 19-month play.
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:13.720]   And there's one further conspiratorial note here, which as a consumer distribers me, Google
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.760]   was also showing what a phone could be and showing what a price could be.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.760]   Right.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.680]   And we're losing that non-market influence of Google.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:23.680]   No.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.920]   So Microsoft tried to do the same thing, by the way.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.040]   We were talking about this on Windows Weekly with a signature PC.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.960]   They were getting pissed off that HP and everybody else was crapping up Windows.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:36.600]   So Microsoft had this initiative called SQL hard to do, but go ahead.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.840]   You know, there's a static judgment, but believe me, you could make Windows worse by
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.080]   putting trialware on of crappy antivirus software, things like that.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:50.960]   So they created these signature PCs that were crapped, were free and none of the partners
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.400]   made them.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.160]   And that's why Microsoft, by the way, did Surface.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.480]   I'm convinced they finally said, look, we've got to make a version of Windows.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.960]   That's the way it should be.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.840]   And I'm convinced that's why Google did Nexus.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:03.640]   But I think that Google's declaring victory.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:08.080]   They're saying, first of all, they got Samsung to offer everybody's offering Google Play
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.080]   editions.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.520]   They sell well, huh?
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.520]   Except Verizon.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.040]   And I think they can declare victory.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.960]   And I think that they always have that threat that they could come back.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.080]   I mean, this doesn't say we'll never do it again.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:27.760]   I think they've demonstrated effectively to Samsung, HTC, LG and others that consumers
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.080]   want the pure Google experience.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.800]   You're better off if you don't chunk it up.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:39.240]   You know, the rumors we're hearing now about the Galaxy S5, no more eyesight tracking.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.280]   They're getting rid of features.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.720]   Which one for the first time may be interested in the Samsung phone?
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:51.760]   Well, I do agree that, you know, with the Motorola deal, there's a lot of nice compliments as
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.760]   far as what Lenovo brings to the table.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:59.640]   And, you know, I'm not privy to those sorts of discussions by a long shot.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.160]   So I have no inside knowledge whatsoever.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.880]   But it does feel like the Nexus line has always served as a really good way to demonstrate
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:10.160]   a vision and a best of breed, whether you, you know, even down to like the Chromebook
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.760]   pixel, like, no, not everybody wants it or is going to buy it.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.920]   But you can really see just what's possible.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.960]   And some people, Jeff and me, we love pixels and we use them.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.320]   And then some people are like, okay, I'm going to use for the price.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.600]   Remember, Larry was very clear.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.880]   We're not getting out of hardware.
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:26.880]   We still got the Nest.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.880]   We still got glass.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.880]   We still got pixels.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:33.040]   And Nest is indeed now in charge of the hardware division.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.400]   Where we're getting out of is one category, phones.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.680]   And they're smart too, because they never made any money on phones.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.760]   So they did funds for that exact reason I agree, Matt, to say, here's what it could
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.040]   be.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.200]   But you don't want to do that to the loss of Android entirely.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.440]   And they were about to lose Android.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.440]   Sure.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.120]   Well, I don't know if I'd go that far.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:58.180]   But it is the case that it's true with Motorola, you had to hold them at enough of an arm's
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:02.240]   length to reassure everyone else that Motorola wasn't getting special treatment, which in
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:06.440]   some sense was almost not fair to Motorola.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:10.920]   So whether you call it next of this or not, I have no idea what will happen.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.960]   But it feels like Google will still want to demonstrate that best of breed and that
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.960]   vision of what it's possible.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:16.960]   Maybe.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.760]   And maybe they will do that as long as they can get help.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:22.000]   And maybe they have side agreements on publicized side agreements with all the manufacturers
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.600]   that we will offer Google Play Edition.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:30.080]   Because if you can get a Galaxy S4 or as Gina has an HTC One Google Play Edition, that demonstrates
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.080]   it.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:35.520]   And it lets the hardware manufacturers show their best stuff.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:41.040]   But you don't get the reference-- you don't get a reference device for developers, particularly
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.480]   with new sensors, right?
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:48.240]   So like if there are new sensors that Android supports or new Android features that require
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.440]   hardware complements, right?
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.440]   Like Google--
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.440]   Like the MotoX?
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.440]   Yes.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.520]   Google still wants to release devices that they can develop in parallel with Android.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   I hope so.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.760]   You know, it's launched a new Android version on.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.960]   I mean, that's kind of my concern and my thing.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.200]   You know, look, the nextest devices ever really sell-- I mean, they weren't about making money.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.360]   It wasn't about trying to make the best phone, right?
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:13.000]   It was a marketing thing for developers and supernourdes, right?
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   But here's the risk.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   Here's the risk.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.880]   You got Samsung, which makes 80% of all Android devices.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.360]   Doing a developers conference, doing Tizen.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:26.040]   I really think they were-- that Samsung was saying, you're going to lose us.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.880]   We're going to skin Android.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.920]   We're going to take off Google Apps.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:36.040]   They are already starting to move Google Apps off in favor of their own.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.320]   And I really think that Google was afraid of-- that Android is much more important to
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:42.040]   their long-term strategy than Nexus.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.040]   Sure.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.040]   Without a doubt.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.040]   Without a doubt.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.320]   I'll just put my vote in.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:51.120]   Since I have no knowledge and necessarily no power in this, I'm just like if Sundar or
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.080]   whoever is listening to this podcast, I vote we keep Nexus around.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.080]   Yay.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.080]   We'll find out.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.080]   It is just a rumor.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.080]   Yeah, that's just my vote.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.080]   There's no more big vote behind that.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.080]   It is just a rumor.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.800]   And I don't think they'll drop the brand name.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.880]   I just think they will-- I think it makes sense for them to stop making Nexus phones,
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.120]   do Google Play Edition.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.560]   And it doesn't have to be permanent.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:15.720]   Hopefully some Googler just cut off as a her run and is going to talk to the right person.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.080]   Wow, that's awesome.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:26.560]   I think it would make sense for Google as long as the other OEMs play nice to say, OK,
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.520]   we don't-- we don't want to hurt you guys.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.520]   This is your business.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.040]   We don't make money on phones.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.200]   We always have the Nexus hammer behind our back.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.080]   But we don't have to use it.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:43.040]   I love Gina's point about a reference device that especially includes like with the MotoX,
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.800]   you have a complement of other chips that show it's not just about the software.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.360]   And that's kind of vision only gets demonstrated if you've got that opportunity.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.000]   So who knows what will happen?
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   But I hope so.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   It does make sense.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.600]   And Google has collaborated with other manufacturers.
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.000]   I mean, all the Nexus devices are from other manufacturers.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.400]   They're not developed in-house, right?
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.520]   Like the MotoX was the only Google-- right?
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.520]   I mean, that's the one.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:13.760]   Well, I would guess that the Nexus 5, given its differences from the LG G2, is somewhat
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.920]   to Google's specification.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.360]   Not made by Google, but somewhat to their specification.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.600]   I do think you make an excellent point, Gina, that if you wanted to add hardware capabilities
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.160]   to Android, you'd need a reference platform.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:33.760]   So maybe Google continues to sell Google Play Edition and Google Developer Edition.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.040]   And maybe just doesn't-- I don't know.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.960]   And maybe the Play Edition or the Developer Edition essentially becomes the Nexus.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.360]   I really don't know.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.640]   But it seems like that kind of cooperation between Google and hardware manufacturers
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.560]   is really useful to show a path forward.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.560]   I don't disagree at all.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.280]   But I think Google wants to go to great pains to demonstrate to Samsung, particularly,
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.400]   we're not competing with you.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.880]   We're partners.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.280]   That's my only thinking.
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.380]   But you know what?
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.600]   Your vote carries a lot more weight than mine, Matt Cutz.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.040]   I wouldn't say that.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.520]   I would.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:12.560]   But I think that's Microsoft seeing that right now with Surface and with Windows Phone and
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.160]   buying Nokia.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.360]   Nobody else-- now that Microsoft owns Nokia, nobody makes Windows phones but Microsoft.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.360]   Nobody makes Windows RT but Microsoft.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.360]   Wow.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:28.760]   And that's the risk you run of making hardware to compete with your channel.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.920]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:33.760]   And so I don't think-- I think Google looked at that and go, "We don't want to get in that
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.760]   situation.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.480]   We don't want to be the only ones making Android phones."
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.760]   I love Nexus phones.
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:39.760]   But you know what?
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.920]   I love the Moto X even better because it was like a Nexus phone with some really cool
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.640]   additional hardware features.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   I hope they fold that into the main--
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.640]   They will.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.640]   --in the Android.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:54.400]   But if you look at what-- if you look at what Lenovo did with ThinkPad, I think what will
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.440]   happen is Lenovo will build a 1080p screen around the same platform.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.840]   This M7-- Google kept the R&D, the OSHA and all of that.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.400]   They kept.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:12.440]   So I don't know where the M7 chip came from, whether it was a Google or a Motorola thing.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:16.080]   That's the additional hardware that lets it sit and listen all the time without depleting
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.560]   battery and shows you the active notifications and all that stuff.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.480]   Yeah, Google needs to keep doing that.
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.480]   Or somebody.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.560]   Anyway, back to the changelog.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:28.560]   Back to the changelog.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.560]   Back to the changelog.
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.560]   Sorry, Gina.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:31.560]   Not M7.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.560]   X8.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.560]   So you're right.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.560]   X8.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.560]   Sorry.
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:36.560]   Go ahead.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.200]   So back to the changelog.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.880]   Two new Chrome features launched.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.800]   A feature that warns users when their browser has been hijacked.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:53.360]   So the Chrome team says that settings hijacking is their number one user complaint.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:58.800]   That's when malware, like screen savers or free games, changes the user's browser settings
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.080]   without their knowledge to do bad stuff, like inject ads.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.160]   So Google engineers added a new feature to Chrome.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.160]   And I believe this is just on Windows that automatically warns users when browser settings
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.960]   have been altered by malware.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:13.080]   So if it gets triggered, there's just a pop-up shows up.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.760]   And it reads something like, you know, Chrome detected that your browser settings may have
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.760]   been changed without your knowledge.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.920]   Would you like to set them back to their original defaults?
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.640]   And this new feature is designed to kind of complement that feature that we talked about
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:28.160]   a couple episodes back where you can reset Chrome to kind of factory settings, you know,
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.400]   brand new original defaults.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:34.160]   If it gets mucked up, if you added a bunch of extensions or if you change a bunch of
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.160]   settings.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.600]   So yeah, nice new feature.
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:44.560]   Hopefully this will reduce the Chrome team's user customer service duties.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:49.960]   And I believe, like I said, I believe that this is just on Windows.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:54.000]   And Google Now, Google Now notifications are now in the Chrome beta.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   So I think a couple episodes ago, I talked about how it was in Chrome Canary.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.040]   It's been graduated to the Chrome beta.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.520]   And this is for Mac Windows and Chromebook computers.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.200]   I was really, really excited about this.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.320]   I enabled this instantaneously.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.680]   I was running stable Chrome and Canary Chrome.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:09.680]   So I ditched them both.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.680]   And now I'm just in the beta, which I think is nice.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.680]   So how do I turn on?
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:13.680]   I'm in beta.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.680]   What do I do?
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:19.280]   So if you go to Chrome colon slash, slash flags, they're enable Google Now, there's a
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.840]   setting to enable Google Now, you change the setting to enabled, you relaunch your browser,
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.400]   and then you'll see a little welcome to Google Now, you're going to get your notification
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.400]   cards here.
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.400]   So Google Now is awesome.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.400]   Careful.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.400]   These experiments may bite.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.640]   Okay, charge, enable, canvas to daily.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.520]   There's too much stuff in here.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.320]   There's a lot of experiments.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.320]   Native experiments.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.280]   You have to know what to search for.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.920]   Just do a search for now.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.920]   There you go.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.400]   I see that's the way I enabled Google Now enabled.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.400]   Okay.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.400]   Relaunch.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.400]   Yeah, we launched.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:58.000]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.760]   that must laugh when he sees all this.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:00.760]   All right.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.760]   Yes.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.920]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, he's now so far beyond that.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.280]   He don't, he doesn't have Google Now.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.440]   He has Google Tomorrow.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.440]   Google.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.440]   What am I doing tomorrow?
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.940]   Now, where does this show up?
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:14.600]   Is it, so you're on a Mac?
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:17.000]   It should have shown up a little welcome card.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.720]   If not, there's a little bell menu bar.
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.200]   You see a little bell?
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.840]   A little bell in my menu bar.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:25.840]   It's Chrome.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:26.840]   Chrome notifications.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.840]   Google Now.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.840]   See anything about Google Now.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:31.840]   It's overcast in Brooklyn.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.240]   Oh, these are now.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.240]   That's now.
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.240]   This is now.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.240]   That's now.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.240]   Oh, now.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.720]   So it's, so it added a menu, even when Chrome's not launched, will that be there?
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.320]   That's interesting.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.920]   And these are my now things.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.920]   Those are now things.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.000]   I don't believe it'll, it'll be there if Chrome is in.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.080]   I believe that that's a Chrome notifications bell.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.440]   And then these are all the, all the things that I can have.
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:53.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.440]   That's, that's non-get.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.640]   That's non-now related.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.640]   Those things are just.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.640]   That's notifications.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.880]   And then you've granted permissions to show you notifications.
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:04.240]   Learn more, Google Now for Chrome.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.720]   This is really nice.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:11.720]   If nobody, if people haven't used it now, this is, well, I guess everybody's.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:16.240]   Now is doing a really good job of like seeing the stuff that I read, like articles that
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.040]   I read and then recommending articles.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.040]   So that's a good point.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.240]   It's a two way street because now it's seeing your browser.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.360]   Well, it was doing that on my phone anyway.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.520]   It was clearly, I mean, Google obviously knows my, a lot of my browsing history.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:36.080]   If I'm, if I'm signed into Chrome, so it would say like, oh, hey, you know, you search for
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.080]   the good wife.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.040]   So here's an article about the good wife or whatever, you know, in on my phone, which
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.640]   was, which, which when it first started to happen, I was like, oh, this is, this is pretty
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.640]   good.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.640]   And you could say, don't show me this again.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.640]   Or you can do that.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.640]   You know, is this card useful?
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.160]   So you can kind of train it.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.000]   Nothing location based though, right?
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.480]   Or, or is it?
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.280]   Um, well, no, no, it definitely does Google Now does do location based.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.040]   Like if you have, if there's an airline ticket in your email and you arrive at the, at the
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.760]   airport, I'm seeing the weather and knows I'm in Petaluma.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.760]   So yeah.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.760]   Wow.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760]   So it knows you're in Petaluma.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760]   I only got a weather card right now.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:12.960]   You got a few other, few other cards, but so pretty happy about that.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.720]   We'll have on the Google now.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.720]   This is neat.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.520]   Uh, that's, that's all I got.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:26.280]   And that's the change long with a little diversion for Leo's conspiracy theory.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.280]   Oh, it's good.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.280]   I, I was good.
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.280]   I like to talk about the Nexus.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.280]   Uh, I, I especially won't be hearing that.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.280]   I had to say.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.720]   Well, you both made very compelling arguments for keeping Nexus alive.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.320]   So maybe they won't get rid of it.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.000]   I'm just happy to see the malware stuff because that's not my team.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.280]   It's like a sibling team, but I'm so excited to see them.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:51.280]   It's like a Seattle Seahawks fan just watching around like, you know, 29 to nothing.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.080]   No, I want to see 43 to nothing.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.680]   Actually, it was just like, in that line, Vayne, let me ask you because we've heard a couple
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:06.520]   of weeks ago about two Chrome extensions that have been sold to add guys and they started
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:12.800]   popping up ads, uh, you know, overlaying ads on the website.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.960]   Is that related to the settings thing or is that something different?
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:19.680]   Well, it's of the same basic umbrella.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:24.000]   I mean, the thing to remember is in my opinion, search has your back and Chrome has your
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   back.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.320]   They care about speed, stability and security.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:33.000]   And Chrome by auto update is able to protect you and Chrome by moving the extensions away
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.320]   from third party toward the web store are able to protect you.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:40.080]   And then the spammers move to like using enterprise policies that businesses usually
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.800]   use and then they lock that down.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:45.600]   And so the next place that the spammers are going to go is just try to do sort of the
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.280]   equivalent of expired domains for web spammers.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:53.200]   They buy existing extensions, but that's okay because then, you know, that's just the
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.160]   next vector and then we'll respond to that back.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.800]   You just kill, you just kill those extensions when you see that.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:03.480]   So, you know, it's in some sense, it's fine to hear about this trend happening, but it's
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:06.160]   not like the Chrome team is going to let that go.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:09.120]   They're, they are going to protect people and they're going to keep iterating and finding
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.120]   ways to protect people.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.120]   And that's why I love Chrome.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.120]   So.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.120]   Oh, I'm a big fan.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.120]   Chrome's awesome.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:18.540]   The permissions model of Chrome though, like I feel like has a little bit of the Android
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:19.540]   permissions model problem.
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:22.800]   I've talked about this on the show before, like about how, I mean, when you make a Chrome
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:28.200]   extension, often if you want to do kind of almost anything, you have to ask for permission
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:33.320]   to the person's browser activity across all websites, which seems like very broad permission
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.000]   to ask.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.520]   But often, you know, I just dabbled a little bit in Chrome extension development, but like
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.000]   that's what you need as a developer to do, you know, what you want to do if you need
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.120]   to do things across, across websites or on any website.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:50.680]   But that kind of, and then when, you know, when you have the extension sold, that permission,
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:54.520]   which I just wish was more granular, or if I wish it was just clear to the user, you
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.200]   know, what's happening or what data is getting sent back and forth.
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.800]   I mean, pretty much every extension that I've got installed could be just logging all
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:07.720]   of my browser activity without me knowing because of kind of the permissions model.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.480]   And I've had this rant about that Android too.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:12.600]   I mean, I love Android's permissions model because it's very granular when you install
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.920]   an app, you get a list of all the things I need access to.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:19.640]   But I often am left wondering, you know, why?
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.360]   Why does it need access to my context?
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:25.480]   Why, you know, and I wish that it was kind of inflow or that it was a little more sandboxed
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.080]   or there was just more kind of information about, you know, what's going on behind the
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:32.200]   scenes because, you know, I mean, all of our devices are just always connected and with
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.520]   broad permissions like that.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:38.600]   I feel like those kind of situations where extensions get sold or apps get taken over
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.880]   and then, you know, bad stuff gets injected and I just have no idea because, you know,
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:45.120]   it's installed and running and doing what I needed to do.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.360]   It's hard to think of a better solution though.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.360]   It is.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:53.680]   Well, I think Chrome was especially good for, you know, 2009 or so whenever they started
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:57.080]   to install extensions like to give you that transparency.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:01.080]   But, you know, I think there's also always room to iterate and do a rethink and say,
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:04.200]   okay, is there some way we could make things more clear?
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:09.560]   As far as extensions getting sold, I'd rather focus on that specific problem because usually
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.440]   you are establishing good faith.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.960]   You're saying I trust this extension.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.200]   And you're going to usually keep trusting that extension unless there's some reason to change,
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.520]   like change of ownership.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.080]   And if you can spot those kinds of transitions, then you can say people from doing a lot of
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:27.000]   work or stress or mental overhead while protecting the vast majority of people.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.280]   You definitely don't want to get too granular on permissions because people just go, yeah,
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.280]   yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.520]   Well, then you have the Windows Vista problem, right?
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:35.520]   Like, yeah.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:38.960]   IOS does it is what I guess you called that in stream.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:44.480]   The idea that it asks you before an application wants location information and you can give
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:48.160]   it permanent access then.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.560]   But IOS can do that only because they don't give you really you grant blanket permissions
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.960]   period.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:00.560]   Really what happens when you install on that, you never told what permissions an app has.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.680]   You trust that Apple wouldn't have approved the app if it was inappropriate.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:08.160]   Yeah, you are sort of depending on their review process, but they sandbox certain things,
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.160]   right?
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.520]   Like they sandbox photo access, location access, contacts access.
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:15.680]   So like in the just those three, just it's just those three.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.680]   So things like camera.
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:22.760]   I mean, I don't know what else you see that all the time in iOS and Apple say, can I
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.960]   access your photos or your in your camera now and you say yes, and you can do permanently
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.080]   or in a one by one, usually.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.560]   Right.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.840]   But at that point, I mean, but it doesn't.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.960]   So there's other things like just recently, what was it?
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:43.560]   That some app just added a huge number of permissions in a very scary way.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.360]   Was it ever known when I'm Android?
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.360]   Facebook.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:54.340]   So the new Facebook app, and I guarantee you nobody noticed this, but it, but, but I
[01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:59.320]   think Google handled it as well as you could do the new Facebook app on Android.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:03.320]   Neat, if one of the permissions it asked for was the ability to send and receive texts
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.480]   on your behalf and to read all your texts.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.480]   Oh, God.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.400]   Pretty scary, right?
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:15.240]   So before I could install it, because it was a changed permission, the play store said
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.240]   permissions have changed.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.840]   You have to read this and it said no.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:19.840]   And it put it right at top.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:21.840]   Actually, there were several new ones besides that.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:23.840]   The play store handles that very well.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.680]   I think that's as well as you're going to do it.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:29.640]   And Apple doesn't have a place for that.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:30.640]   Right.
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.600]   That would have just, I don't even know if it happened.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:36.440]   It might have happened already on iOS and we don't know.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:41.440]   Yeah, there's a, there's really, there's a balance, right, between like simplicity and
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.920]   then obfuscating information, you know what I mean?
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:46.360]   Like Apple would argue that's a bad user experience, right?
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:50.440]   To have to like read through a generic list of permissions and decide whether or not you
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:56.040]   trust Facebook enough to read all your text messages, which is sort of a jarring experience,
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.040]   right?
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:01.480]   And I would have, I would have paused and really think about, but, but, but the other side,
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.840]   flip side of the coin is that you should know, you should know if an app is looking at your
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.040]   text messages, particularly text messages.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.040]   That's, that's pretty personal.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.800]   But I think it's fair feedback.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.320]   There's always room to ask ourselves, is there some other better way we could think of
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.320]   to do it?
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.520]   I think that's a fair question to ask Facebook did post a page why it's asking for this.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:24.400]   And a lot of this has to do with the fact that permissions are clumped.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.040]   So in order to do one of those things, it has to ask for permissions to do all of them.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.040]   Well, that's the other thing.
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.240]   I would like to say no, you can't have my text messages.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:33.280]   You can have everything else, but you can't have those.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.280]   But then that breaks the app.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:40.800]   Well, but, but, but you should be able to say, you know, give me all the functionality
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.400]   of the app except for the functionality.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.280]   I know this puts a lot on developers and I know there's a whole different thing, but
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:48.800]   like there's the Facebook app should be able to function.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:53.040]   I should be able to read my news feed and send a Facebook message without Facebook having
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.360]   access to my text messages.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.760]   Like, that's not unreasonable.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:58.840]   So the reason they did this, and by the way, it wasn't to send text messages, but merely
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.400]   to read incoming text messages.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:06.840]   The reason they added this is so that when they're confirming the phone number, you know,
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.120]   you enter the phone number and the confirm it.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.400]   You don't have to wait for you to see the text message and enter the number.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.080]   It can all happen automatically, right?
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.080]   So that's reasonable.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.080]   It is.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.920]   What's, it's so funny.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.320]   So what's app does it that way?
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.400]   When you, when you give what's app your phone number, it just goes, okay, got it.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.720]   And, you know, you wait a little bit.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.960]   What's really happening is the text messages being sent, received and deleted.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.720]   I think Facebook, you had to see the text message, see the six digit number, enter it
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:38.000]   in, and now you've got a confirmation code.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.440]   And from that point on, they don't need access to your text messages, but they have access
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.440]   to your text messages.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.000]   This is what Facebook's saying.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.200]   Another one that's another one download files without notification.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.320]   That's risky, but they say, well, this, this is how we can preload news fade content
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.320]   this way.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:55.920]   Preload a news feed content, right?
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.760]   And they can, they also do the updates themselves, right?
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.680]   They push their own app updates.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.520]   You don't mention that, but yes.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:03.480]   Read write your contacts.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:08.880]   This allows us to import your contacts to Facebook and to sync Facebook contacts.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.560]   So yeah, I mean, it's hard.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.560]   You know what?
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.960]   You said the word trust was that you were Matt.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:15.960]   It was Matt.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:20.400]   Ultimately, it comes down to do, I trust this app, then I'm going to give it these permissions.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:28.000]   Well, yeah, and trust matters because if Google or Apple or whoever don't handle these things
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.600]   well, then people lose trust in us.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.560]   And so that was the funniest thing about the Chrome extension kerfluffle because I think
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:37.720]   a lot of people said, oh, Google is somehow looking the other way.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:41.760]   No, no, it's just hard to be aware of all the different attack vectors and please all
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.920]   the different bad actors.
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:46.160]   But the Chrome guys take this, the Chrome team takes this very seriously.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.320]   I thought you would take action because I thought it seemed like, yes, I, it wasn't,
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.160]   I didn't look like it was something done on purpose.
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:54.240]   It was a new vector, a new attack vector.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:57.560]   And it does, it is a flaw because I have to approve the extent, you have to approve the
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.680]   extension to get on the store, but you don't have to approve updates.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:05.080]   So a malicious update can be added to a non malicious extension after the fact.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:08.320]   And this is, so I do, so it is about trust, but it's also about control, right?
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:12.080]   Like, so the platforms have to build in ways for users to be able to control, you know,
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.440]   to say you can have access to my text messages for the next 10 minutes.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.440]   And after that, then you can't.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:22.160]   And I know that this creates like a lot of UI and could also, you know, be tedious
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.880]   and maybe, you know, you're risking going Windows Vista, but there's trust.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.360]   And then there's also, there's also control.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.080]   And I think that there has to be a balance, right?
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.400]   Like, and part of that's on Android to give, give you, you know, give users the ability
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.120]   to deny, you know, certain permissions, part of it's on developers to be clearer in their
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.120]   communication.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:45.080]   I mean, if Facebook needs access to my, all my text messages forever and ever, just so
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.800]   they can read one text message when they're setting up my phone, like that seems crazy
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.800]   to me.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.800]   Well, honestly, they have.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:55.160]   Do you have Facebook on your Android device?
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.400]   I do, but I'm going to uninstall it after this.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:02.120]   Because, because if you updated it in the last couple of weeks, that's what happened.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.640]   You know, I don't use the native messaging app.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:05.960]   Like I use Google Voice.
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:06.960]   Wasn't messaging.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:07.960]   It was the Facebook app.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.960]   Or right.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:13.160]   But when they were asking for access to my text messages, they're asking for access to
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:14.960]   my native messaging message.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:15.960]   Right.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:16.960]   So, you know what I mean?
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:17.960]   I don't, I don't text that way.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:21.960]   I wouldn't be getting, you know, Google owns all my text messages.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.760]   So, you know, I decided to trust them.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.400]   See, you got to trust somebody.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.680]   Which way I go most this week in Google.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:34.400]   So, I want to just look at the Facebook because I was just updated description.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.960]   I guess you can't go back and look at, there must be somewhere I could see the permissions
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.120]   that I've granted to this app.
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:41.760]   That is, that is available.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.880]   It's under app info in the, ah, okay.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.360]   Okay.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.880]   So you can go back and look at Gina and you actually probably approved it.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.880]   I probably did.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:52.880]   Didn't look at it.
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:58.280]   I think what we'll Facebook, at one point in Facebook's changes to privacy, they got better
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:02.440]   about telling you what you were doing at the moment you did it.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.040]   You're sharing this with blank.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:09.800]   And I think that's, that's, it's not always workable, but it's not a bad way to do it.
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.960]   That at the moment you're taking an action, if there is a choice involved, give you the
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:18.760]   choice then, unless it becomes too wearing and you are a kind of choice.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.280]   Or let me say, don't ask me again.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.480]   Let me understand in the context of what I'm doing.
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:25.480]   Right.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.480]   Right.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.440]   I mean, it's a huge challenge, particularly on mobile to, to give that kind of information.
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.400]   I mean, you're creating more, more friction, right?
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:35.880]   Like, you know, frictionless sharing that, that adds, that adds friction to sharing, you
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:39.320]   know, reading, you know, seeing the thing, just like the, the new permissions of dialogue.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.200]   You're like, oh wait, but there's a balance.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:45.920]   There's a balance between control and being informed and also having an easy experience
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.880]   on a tiny, tiny, touch screen with your thumb, you know.
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.880]   So by the way, I've also apparently, I mean, though, this given Facebook, the Facebook
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:54.840]   app to directly call phone numbers.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:57.600]   It can call phone numbers.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.280]   It can read my text messages.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:02.400]   It can take pictures and video, record audio, location.
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.360]   It does, you know, so yeah, this, you're right, Chad.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:08.640]   If you go into the apps interface, you can read all the, or was it chatter, Jason, and
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.680]   said that you can read all the stuff.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:14.760]   Yeah, it's the app info and a quick way to get to it is from your launcher.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:18.320]   If you're in the thing, you can click and hold and instead of uninstall, just drag over
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:21.240]   to app info if you're on KitKat or something similar.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:25.960]   So I'm curious, Gene, if you actually gave it permission and just weren't paying attention,
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.680]   which just shows that the mechanism is broken.
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:30.680]   Because you're a smart person.
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:35.080]   At some point, I enabled Android to automatically update my apps, but it doesn't automatically
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.400]   update if they're a new permission.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.400]   That's right.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:41.920]   And where it would have said, Facebook can't be automatically updated unless you say yes.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:48.040]   But that's via the Play Store and Facebook's app, Facebook's app updates happen in app,
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:49.040]   right?
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.520]   No, this was, well, this not this one.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:55.960]   And of course, you can't do an update that changes capabilities without asking permission.
[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:56.960]   Right.
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.760]   Because it's, those are intense, right?
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:01.680]   You have to, you have to have OS level permission to do that.
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:02.680]   Right.
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.560]   You can't just say, no, I changed my mind.
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.400]   I want to read text messages.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.280]   And it seems like maybe Facebook wanted to do it that way.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:13.920]   And we said, no, all updates that require new permissions have to go through the store
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.480]   or something like that.
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.080]   Hey, Chromecast is now open to developers.
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.080]   I don't know what this means.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.080]   Gene will explain.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:21.080]   Mm-hmm.
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:27.280]   The Google Cast software development kit for developers who want to build Chromecast support
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.000]   has been released as of Monday.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.680]   You still have to get permission from Google, though, right?
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.320]   Or no.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:38.640]   What I want is that I can write an app right now that works from that Chromecast.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.640]   I think so.
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.880]   I think it's just porn is, is prohibited.
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.240]   So I guess they find a way to kill that.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.480]   Why would you prohibit porn?
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.480]   Who cares?
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.480]   I know.
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:47.480]   Wait a minute.
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:48.480]   Come on.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:50.480]   Who cares?
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:53.760]   I downloaded a porn app and I want to send it to my porn Chromecast.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.760]   That's me.
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:58.840]   And your lonely apartment study there, your story is not illegal.
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:32:59.840]   You bought the device.
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:00.840]   Yeah.
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:01.840]   No, they can't really.
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.840]   They're blocking porn.
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:06.840]   Actually, I don't know whether they require permission now.
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:11.560]   But I think the big step here is the SDK is available for everyone to start to use.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.880]   So I don't know whether there's still one gating factor beyond that.
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:19.440]   I think because we haven't seen a flood of new apps, there must still be the issue of
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.080]   you then have to be approved.
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.840]   The terms of service developers have to agree in order to make their apps Chromecast compatible.
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:30.280]   One of the conditions explicit content is a no-go says Giga.
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.480]   I'll stop it.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.680]   Come on.
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:34.680]   We don't allow content.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:35.680]   No, get this.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.680]   Get this.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.680]   Get this.
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:38.680]   Right.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.680]   So this would actually get rid of HBO.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:41.880]   We don't allow content that contains nudity.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.880]   That's Game of Thrones.
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:45.440]   Traffic sex acts or sexual use, plus it material.
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:46.440]   That's Game of Thrones.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:47.440]   That's cable.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:48.440]   That's well.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.440]   Well, they might also be.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:55.040]   HBO is Chromecast enabled though.
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.440]   So maybe it has.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:01.480]   Maybe people don't want Chromecast to be known as porncast in the beginning or something.
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:03.480]   Maybe they'll lighten up later on.
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.120]   This is the whole Steve Jobs thing.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:08.680]   You can't do porn on iOS.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:13.200]   But I got to point out porn is not illegal in the United States.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:21.600]   And if it's adults downloading porntube.com app, why should Google get involved there?
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:22.760]   Google doesn't have to promote it.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:26.320]   It doesn't have to list it on apps that you can do.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:30.440]   But somebody wants to enable the Chrome button in their app.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:31.920]   But that's a side light.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.960]   What I really want is that the Twit apps, and we don't develop our own app, but there
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:38.880]   are a number of people who do, can be enabled for Chromecast.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:44.080]   And I suspect that that's still, we're getting closer.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:50.200]   And well, I think the Chromecast, there was a person who had like reversed, engineered
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:51.200]   the API.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.200]   Coache.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.200]   Coache.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:57.600]   And I think people sort of said, well, we're still working actively on the API and getting
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.600]   the SDK.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:03.560]   So now if the SDK is actually released, I mean, if you own a device, yeah, you could, in
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:07.760]   theory, if it's frozen in stone at a 1.0, in theory, somebody could reverse engineer
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.760]   it.
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:09.960]   Oh, that's his app, all cast.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.640]   So it now works again.
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:15.600]   So Coache due to immediately went back, fixed it, and it works.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:16.600]   Oh, that's great news.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:17.600]   That's what they wanted to do.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:21.400]   He was upset because he had used a non-approved kind of hack around.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.640]   Google disabled it, probably not.
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:27.960]   And I think he even agreed, not aimed at him, but just, you know, it was never approved.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:30.960]   It was deprecated and it broke all cast.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.160]   So all cast is working out.
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.160]   That's good.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.160]   Very cool.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:37.960]   By the way, you can stream your porn with all cast.
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:38.960]   Or--
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:39.960]   Right.
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:40.960]   Right.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:41.960]   Because it's from your device, right?
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:43.960]   My God, Leo is going to have his porn on the big screen.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:44.960]   Damn it.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:47.320]   I don't care if it's 340p.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.840]   How big is that?
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.120]   Kerms screen here is Leo.
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.080]   How big is that?
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:57.160]   Well, and there's something I think Plex like also works.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:00.720]   So, you know, at the point where you can stream whatever your own content is--
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:04.880]   It's probably one of those things where, you know, we just want to make sure that it's--
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:05.880]   We say it.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:06.880]   Yeah, we say it.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:07.880]   We don't have to enforce it.
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.880]   Gigantic sexual organs.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.040]   Google brings you gigantic sexual organs, yes.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.560]   That's a double standard.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.640]   Because if it were your gigantic sexual organ, you wouldn't mind so much.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:25.240]   It's just other peoples you don't want to see.
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:26.240]   Exactly.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.440]   Because we haven't moved in our new place yet.
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:32.840]   I've been sort of-- I've been in transit and staying with different relatives and Airbnb
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:33.840]   and the whole thing.
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.840]   And the Chromecast is so small and so easy.
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:38.240]   Like I just had it in my backpack.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.240]   I love it.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:42.240]   So, that's been my primary media center basically for over a month now.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.240]   Isn't it correct?
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.240]   And I just absolutely love it.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.640]   It's so easy to set up.
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:50.240]   But I've often wanted to-- you know, I come home at night and be like, oh, I want to show
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.600]   pictures of the baby to my mom.
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:57.800]   I just want to throw those photos up on the TV without having to show her on the phone.
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.400]   And so I'm really excited about this.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.400]   This is really good.
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.400]   I'm down.
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:05.560]   I have installed all cast right now because sending up, you know, my personal media is
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:06.920]   definitely something I wanted to--
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:10.920]   One thing I would like to see in a-- it's ridiculous because it's a $35 device.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.520]   I wish it supported 5Ghz as well as 2.4Ghz WiFi.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.720]   Yeah, I'd agree with that.
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.040]   And that's mostly because I use a Sonos which is on 2.4 and basically I cannot use 2.4
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.320]   because we have Sonos so all over the house.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.320]   I can't use 2.4.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.720]   It's just not reliable in my house.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:28.160]   So I use 5G for everything.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.160]   The 5Ghz band.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.840]   And it would be nice if-- so the Chromecast doesn't work so well in the distant reaches
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.960]   of the house other than that.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:35.960]   I was great.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:42.400]   I was this close to buying a new TV so I could use it better with my Chromecast because Chromecast
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.920]   actually supports CECs.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:45.720]   You can like switch channels without--
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:46.720]   It works great.
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:47.920]   --with your input source.
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.800]   And I've got an ancient TV that doesn't handle that well.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:54.440]   And so I was about to do the same thing, Matt.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.400]   Because I have one TV that only has one HDMI.
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:02.000]   The $35 dongle that's going to cost you 4G.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000]   Yes.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000]   Yes.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000]   And then they stopped making the Panasonic ST60.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.560]   And I'm like, OK, I'll wait a few.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:08.560]   Get it while you can.
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:11.080]   No, if you could find anybody who's still selling it, get it.
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.040]   Yeah, Amazon are best buy and stop.
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.040]   They've stopped.
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.040]   Oh, that kills me.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.040]   That's a great TV.
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:18.280]   Chromecast into many TVs in the past six weeks.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:20.360]   I have yet to find one that powers it.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.160]   Like I have to plug it in every time.
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.840]   Yeah, I don't think it's MHL.
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.880]   I don't think it does power.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:27.040]   I have an MHL port.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:28.880]   I know an MHL port and it didn't work.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.600]   You still have to plug the little USB thing.
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:33.240]   It's another-- you know, there's little things you could approve.
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.520]   I thought it could take power from the HDMI.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.120]   Well, it needs to be MHL.
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:39.160]   If it's MHL and it's an MHL port--
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:40.320]   Yeah, only in that case yet.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:44.360]   But I think it's not because I tried it on my MHL and didn't power it.
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:45.360]   I'll try it again.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.000]   Maybe I just missed something.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000]   But you know, many TVs now have USB ports.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000]   So you just plug in--
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000]   Oh, right.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.480]   So you could just plug in the-- oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.480]   That's smart.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:57.400]   That's way smarter because that's the only bad party experience.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.000]   Like, oh, where's the plug?
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.600]   Because behind the entertainment center
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:06.480]   is always just this massive unavailable outlets.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.960]   So it's always a pain plug.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.600]   That's why we all think of the television
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:12.040]   as the $4,000 dongle for Chromecast.
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:17.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:20.040]   That's the right-- now you've got your priorities straight.
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:21.400]   CEC is really cool.
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.520]   It works very well with the Chromecast.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.040]   If you have a properly implemented CEC, actually,
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.600]   I think the VRs are a little funky.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.840]   Oh, OK.
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:32.560]   I'm using it.
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:35.040]   It works great on a Samsung device.
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:37.040]   CEC is funny.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:38.600]   That's the thing.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.280]   Everybody has a different name for it.
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:43.280]   A Samsung calls it any share or something like that.
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:45.280]   [SIGHS]
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.160]   Standards.
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:49.000]   Twitter results out.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.320]   Twitter crushes, says TechCrunch.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:56.000]   The fourth quarter revenue of $242 million.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.320]   I don't know why.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:01.000]   When you talk in Apple profits of $13 billion,
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000]   Google profits have went up through $4 billion.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.400]   Review of--
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.000]   Leo, Leo, give me credit.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.800]   I was not that long ago when I made front of Fred Wilson.
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:12.960]   And many of us did, saying there was no discernible Twitter
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.520]   business model.
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.360]   So Dick Costalo has--
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.040]   No, I agree.
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:17.480]   --got it in.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:19.040]   He's got real revenue.
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:20.640]   It's a start.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:22.440]   The stock went down after that result
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:25.000]   because of the supposed user growth issue.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.600]   But there is a path visible now for Twitter,
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:29.960]   which just wasn't at the beginning.
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:33.160]   Earnings per share of $0.02.
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.600]   Analysts had thought they would lose $0.02.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.040]   Nick built and said an interesting thing
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:39.240]   when he was on our triangulation show.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:40.400]   He's the author of "Hatching Twitter."
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.920]   Probably now knows more about Twitter than any human alive.
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:45.080]   He said they completely have the dials
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.600]   to how much profit they make.
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.080]   That's up to them.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:49.440]   They tweak it.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:51.480]   But that also-- the trade-off is how much you
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:52.880]   piss off your users.
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:53.720]   Yes.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:56.800]   Well, even more than that, how much they reinvest--
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.240]   I mean, they can--
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:58.560]   Sure.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.560]   They have control of--
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.600]   they've got the revenue.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.240]   That's the point.
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:06.400]   And how much profit they make on $242 million in revenue
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.040]   is up to them.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.960]   They can be 5%, 10%, 0%.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.200]   And so they decide to make a little bit of profit,
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.240]   not a lot, just a little bit of profit.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:15.640]   They can't control user growth.
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:18.640]   And I think that's why stock market may be a little bit.
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.680]   So what happened with user growth?
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:23.560]   It slowed.
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.920]   They still grew.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:27.000]   But the growth slowed.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:34.320]   Gina, using ThinkUp, it's been really interesting
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.760]   because it shows you the people who follow you.
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.480]   And it has this notion of the people who
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.440]   are kind of interesting or important.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:45.720]   And it's a little scary because whenever I check these people
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:48.680]   out, I'm like, oh, that's 30,000 fake followers
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.520]   this guy has.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.400]   Like--
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.400]   Oh, no.
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.240]   That's not good.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.680]   Well, that means our algorithm is--
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:57.800]   ThinkUp should not make you insecure.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.840]   Well, hopefully-- I mean, ideally, Twitter
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:02.920]   wouldn't let these guys have 30,000 followers
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:05.640]   in the first place.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:08.720]   But maybe it's more me in the area that I play around in.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:10.200]   Like me and Danny Sullivan, we probably
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:11.720]   have a lot of fake followers.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:12.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.960]   You probably do, right?
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.160]   Because you talk about--
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.040]   I would follow him.
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:20.560]   If I were a spammer, I'd be following that for sure.
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:22.560]   And the bots.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:26.680]   Like, there's this Mitchell-Mary, and ThinkUp's like,
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:28.480]   they've got 30,000 followers.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.240]   And I'm like, that is pure auto-generated spam.
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:33.800]   You recognize it, don't you?
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:35.360]   And you could see spamming your sleeves.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.560]   Yeah, you'd say you spelled from a mile away.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:43.160]   Well, to be fair, the ad is for cash4urightnow.com.
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:47.320]   I mean, it shouldn't be hard to talk to you guys today.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:51.160]   So it is embarrassing where cash4u.com has more followers
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:53.080]   than you do.
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:57.120]   But I mean, hatching Twitter was such a good book.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:59.280]   And I had no idea what--
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:00.240]   Isn't that a story?
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:00.720]   How much is it going on?
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.240]   It's amazing.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.960]   And it's a real testament to Twitter
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:06.440]   that they built something so important,
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:09.880]   given that there's been a lot of shift and tectonic shifts
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.920]   within the company and outside, of course.
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.280]   If I may be so bold, I think we have Gina's
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.480]   outcoming as mine as well.
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:20.640]   Let's go.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:22.080]   Let's wrap it up.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:24.440]   All right, we got all the important stuff.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:25.200]   We got the good stories.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.760]   Hashtags mentioned 57% of Super Bowl ads,
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.200]   according to Danny Sullivan and his daughter, who counted.
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.960]   That was a very scientific method.
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:38.200]   Calendar, Google Calendar.
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.800]   Now let's you subscribe to holidays
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:42.760]   for 30 different cultures.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:46.560]   Up from 12, or whatever.
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:51.120]   Google goes to war on fraudulent YouTube video views.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.120]   Get them.
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:52.680]   Get them.
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:53.720]   Get them.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.320]   That's like the-- you're rooting for the Seahawks again.
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:58.820]   Yeah.
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:00.200]   And by the way, while you're at it,
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.960]   you're part of those darned Google+ comment spammers.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:03.720]   They're back.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.280]   Are they?
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.520]   They can go to likeers.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:08.560]   Somebody will like 20 posts.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.120]   Posts.
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.400]   I will pass that on.
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:12.560]   That's a signal.
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:13.840]   I'm talking to you on Monday.
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:14.600]   Who will help with that?
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:19.040]   YouTube $1 billion in music payouts.
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:22.480]   Still, some labels are unhappy.
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:26.880]   And Flappy Bird.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:27.760]   That's all I have to say.
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:30.640]   Just two words.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.720]   Flappy Bird.
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:34.320]   It's iOS though, so you--
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.680]   Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:36.920]   You don't know what I'm talking?
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:37.440]   No, I do.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:37.920]   I know.
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:38.760]   How can you not?
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:38.760]   I know.
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:40.360]   I know that it's a popular game.
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.480]   It's one Android.
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.600]   Is it an Android view?
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:43.080]   It's an Instagram.
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.520]   Wish you hadn't told me that yet.
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:45.520]   Yeah, it was--
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.020]   Oh.
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:48.200]   Same.
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:49.920]   You know me in my Nexus 5, right?
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:55.800]   Our show they brought to you by 99 Designs.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:00.800]   My friends, if you are good at something
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.800]   that is not designed--
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.800]   you know, maybe you're a great chef.
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:06.800]   You're a wonderful storyteller.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.800]   You're a programmer.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:11.800]   And why is it that people who have great skills
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:14.800]   in one area think they can be designers?
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.800]   Design is an art.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:17.800]   Design is literally an art.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:19.800]   It's something to it.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:20.800]   You're either good at it or not.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:23.800]   And you see so many ill design, poorly designed,
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:27.800]   you know, ads, menus, web pages,
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:30.800]   go to 99designs.com and get a great design
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:32.800]   from really, really good designers,
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:38.800]   270,000 designers at last count at 99designs.com,
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.800]   99designs.com.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.800]   Whether you're looking for a new logo,
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:43.800]   don't do your own logo.
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:45.800]   That's just not right.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:48.800]   Responsive website, stationary t-shirt.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.800]   There's a designer at 99designs
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:53.800]   that can bring your designs to life.
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:55.800]   Wouldn't it be cool if you could start your next project
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:57.800]   and have dozens of designers to choose from
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.800]   just a few days later?
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:45:59.800]   You can.
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:02.800]   Selection, speed, creativity, a few of the benefits
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:05.800]   from having several designers work on your design project
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:06.800]   instead of just one.
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.800]   When you launch a design contest, that's what they call them,
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.800]   you'll get lots of creative ideas.
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:11.800]   Give the designers feedback.
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:13.800]   End up with the perfect design within a week.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:16.800]   The process is fun, fast, 100% satisfaction guaranteed
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:17.800]   and affordable.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:19.800]   You can start your next graphic design project
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:21.800]   for as low as $199.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:25.800]   And when you go to 99designs.com/twig,
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:29.800]   you will get a $99 power pack of savings free.
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.800]   That gives you more designer time and attention.
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:34.800]   99designs will bold, highlight and feature your project
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:35.800]   and their marketplace.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:38.800]   You will get nearly twice as many designs.
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:41.800]   Have we started the design t-shirt to design contest yet?
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:43.800]   Because we have five really nice designs.
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:44.800]   Actually, it's for a hoodie.
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:45.800]   A twit hoodie we're going to say.
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:46.800]   I've been waiting for a hoodie.
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:47.800]   It's great.
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.800]   Did you see it?
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:52.800]   Yeah, we did it on Google+, I think we put up this.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:53.800]   Lisa put it up.
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.800]   Anyway, great designs we got from all the designers.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:56.800]   We picked five.
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:57.800]   We're going to have a showdown.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:59.800]   It's so fun.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:00.800]   And it's good.
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.800]   Help the world look better.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:03.800]   One design at a time.
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:05.800]   99designs.com/twig.
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.800]   Get that power pack of savings worth $99 for free.
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:11.800]   We thank it for their support.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:14.800]   I think that's the one that's winning right now.
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:15.800]   That's on a t-shirt, but it would be on a hoodie.
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:16.800]   I really like this one.
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:17.800]   That's nice.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:18.800]   I like that a lot.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:19.800]   Yeah.
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:20.800]   Lisa says that's too simple.
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:21.800]   That's kind of fun.
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:22.800]   A little retro design.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:23.800]   That's cool.
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:25.800]   These are all from 99designs.
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:26.800]   I love this.
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:27.800]   This is kind of steampunk-y.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:29.800]   Isn't that great?
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.800]   That's really cute.
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:33.800]   Steampunk-ers-scare-me.
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:34.800]   We couldn't pick just one.
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.800]   We just went crazy.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:36.800]   There's a graffiti style design.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.800]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:40.800]   These are all from designers at 99designs.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:44.800]   And we're going to pick one and we're going to sell that hoodie on, I think, next month
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:45.800]   on Teespring.
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:46.800]   99designs.com.
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:55.720]   It is time for Gina Trippani's Tip of the Week.
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:56.720]   So okay.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.240]   This tip is kind of nerdy, but it's kind of amazing.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:00.560]   I had to share it.
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:06.160]   This is a blog post by Mihai Paparida, who actually, I think is currently a Googler.
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:10.000]   I know at some point he was on the Google Reader team.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.400]   And he did a post.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:14.800]   Matt, do you know if Mihai still at Google?
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:16.800]   I think Mihai has actually left.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:18.200]   But yeah, he was on the Google Reader team.
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:19.200]   He's a fantastic dude.
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:20.920]   Mihai has left the building.
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:21.920]   He's amazing.
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:24.520]   He's published all these Grease Monkey Scrips.
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.760]   I mean, he's really, really great code writer.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.600]   Oh, he's great at sharing a code.
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:35.320]   And he wrote this post about these internal system Gmail labels.
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:36.320]   He actually kind of reversed.
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:42.400]   He didn't hack, but he watched requests back and forth to Gmail over the line to see
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:47.320]   how users would mark messages certain ways if they were muting conversations or marking
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:48.320]   them as spam.
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:55.360]   Because Google had that bug where for a very small percentage of users messages that shouldn't
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:57.920]   have gotten marked as spam did or wound up in the trash.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:02.160]   And they said, hey, you should check to make sure-- just take a look through your spam
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.080]   folder and make sure that everything there is legitimately spam because we did have this
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:07.800]   bug and it's been fixed, but check it out.
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.600]   So Mihai found these internal system labels that you can use to search your Gmail.
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:19.960]   So he published a little search query that you can use inside Gmail to say, show me all
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:24.760]   the messages that are spam, which I explicitly marked as spam.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:26.480]   And it's using one of these kind of system labels.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:34.880]   So the search is is colon spam, which is a normal regular user search, minus label colon
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:38.200]   and this internal system label is a carrot OS.
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:45.080]   So you're basically saying, show me all the spam that Google didn't mark automatically.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:47.680]   Show me just the spam messages I marked.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:52.000]   So which comes in really useful if you've fat-fingered something, if you accidentally feel like you
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.480]   marked a legitimate message of spam, you can go back and see them without having to--
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.480]   Thank God.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:57.480]   --all your spam messages.
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:58.480]   I do that all the time.
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:00.640]   I accidentally click it and then I go, oh, shoot.
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:01.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:02.640]   That's so bad.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:07.800]   And if you're interested in how Gmail works, this post is really kind of amazing, especially
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.000]   that he's not Google anymore.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.320]   I mean, he obviously knows how some of Google's web services work, but he writes in detail
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:19.520]   how he kind of figured out what all these hidden system labels are.
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:20.520]   And there are quite a few of them.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:25.920]   You can say, show me all the messages which I've muted, show me all the messages that
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.320]   were marked as phishing attempts, show me all my chat transcripts.
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:34.640]   And a lot of these are exposed as regular search terms for users, but some of them actually,
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:35.920]   some of them aren't.
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:40.960]   So you show me all my Google voice messages, show me all the messages which have the option
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:44.640]   for Gmail to unsubscribe me from them.
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:48.880]   So really, really cool stuff here if you're interested in how Gmail works and make a total
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:49.880]   signature.
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:50.880]   It's like the in-app secret menu.
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:51.880]   Yeah, it is.
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:52.880]   It really is.
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:53.880]   It's pretty cool.
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:54.880]   Wow.
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:55.880]   Really good find.
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:57.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:58.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:50:59.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:02.160]   And how Gmail smart labels work.
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:05.160]   Yeah, some really good stuff here.
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:06.160]   Nice.
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:07.160]   Good tip.
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.160]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.800]   That's worthy of Life Hacker.
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:10.800]   That's fabulous.
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:13.320]   That's got Life Hacker written all over it for sure.
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:15.320]   Jeff, do you have a number of the week this week?
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.320]   Yes, I do.
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:17.320]   Real quick.
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:18.320]   It's a fun post.
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:26.000]   If you go to it in the rundown, the Google's first server bill from a Uruz Hörze.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.240]   I got to do this fast because I got to go.
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:40.520]   Who was point number nine, I think put up the first server bill and an extra megabit
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:42.040]   cost $1,400.
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:43.040]   Wow.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:45.520]   And look at it later.
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:46.520]   It's expensive.
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:50.880]   Sergey adds into the discussion with a few of very, very nerdy points.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:51.880]   Really?
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:52.880]   In the comments?
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:53.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:54.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:58.600]   He shows up and he's like, "The C machines stood for crawl."
[01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:02.640]   And so we skipped the B rack and just named them A and then C and all this.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:05.600]   Oh, thank you, Sergey.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.240]   That is awesome.
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.680]   And I apologize, but I've got to run.
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:10.680]   See you both.
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:12.680]   Take care.
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:13.680]   I do too.
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:14.680]   All right.
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.680]   That's not mad.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:16.680]   Thank you.
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:17.680]   Always a pleasure.
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:18.680]   Bye-bye.
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.680]   Take care.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:20.680]   See you next week.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:22.960]   That has a tip for all you webmasters out there.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:27.240]   In fact, if you don't see Matt's webmaster videos on YouTube, you've got to.
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:28.720]   They're a requirement.
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:32.280]   If you're an SEO, it might be worth your time.
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:38.640]   So I did a post on my personal blog last week that basically just said, "Look, guest
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:43.160]   blogging has gotten out of control in terms of SEO purposes."
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:47.240]   So if a random guy writes you out of the blue and says, "Hey, I'd like to do a guest
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:48.240]   post."
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.400]   You should be suspicious.
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:52.920]   You should be especially suspicious if they offer you money or something like that.
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:56.040]   Because at this point, it's gotten to be really, really spammy.
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:53:00.560]   So we just wanted to telegraph that so that people know to be on guard and be a little
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:02.200]   bit cautious.
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:06.480]   We've been taking action on some pretty large link networks and some pretty large websites
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:11.000]   across the web that have been using or abusing these types of techniques.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.440]   So if you get a random email solicitation, be skeptical about that.
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:19.920]   If it's Leo Leport and he wants to do a guest podcast, of course, that's the sort of thing
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:20.920]   you want.
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:25.360]   If it's just someone you've never heard of, there's spelling errors in the email, just
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:27.280]   be pretty suspicious of that.
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:31.040]   What's the YouTube channel where your webmaster videos are?
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:35.640]   I forget, but if you search for webmaster videos, it ranks number one in Google.
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:36.640]   What a surprise!
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:39.680]   It ranks organically.
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:40.680]   No worries about that.
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:43.040]   So it's youtube.com/user/googlewebmasterhelp.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:46.040]   But I always search for webmaster videos.
[01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:47.120]   Yeah, that's easier.
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:53.360]   That cuts is, in fact, according to Adam Curry, the most powerful man in the world.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:56.160]   Simply by his role at Google.
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.640]   Or most hated, we'll see.
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.200]   Always great to have you on.
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:00.200]   Thank you, Matt.
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.200]   We'll let you go too.
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:02.200]   Okay, thanks very much.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:05.080]   My tool of the week, Flappy Bird!
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:09.000]   Flappy Bird!
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.040]   I knew it was on Android all along.
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:12.640]   In fact, I'd already installed it.
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.520]   I just was trying to forget.
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:19.080]   Do not install this app on anything you have.
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:21.080]   It is the most...
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:22.480]   It is totally viral.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:26.640]   I cannot figure out why, because it's really hard to play.
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:28.840]   Who's the Flappy Bird record holder at the Brickhouse?
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:29.840]   I think it's Josh.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:31.400]   She's got like 40.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:32.400]   Yeah.
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:33.400]   How many?
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:37.400]   The idea is you're flapping this bird to get him.
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:39.000]   Oh, crap.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000]   Get him through the holes.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.680]   That's it.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:42.680]   That's all there is to it.
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:46.360]   I don't know why it's so addictive, but it is.
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:53.240]   It is literally number one in like 20 different app stores.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.680]   You always go from below.
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:56.120]   I noticed that.
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:57.560]   Stay low is the tip.
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:03.080]   I feel like you have saved me four hours now, Leo, because I've seen enough where I don't
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:04.080]   have to install it.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.880]   Yeah, I'm doing you a favor.
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:08.440]   If this makes you want to play this game, you shouldn't...
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:11.200]   You should just go hide.
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:17.440]   Because this is the most frustrating game ever, and yet it is absolutely viral.
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:23.440]   Flappy Bird.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:24.440]   Backcuts.
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:28.560]   Thank you so much, you rock most powerful man in the world.
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.560]   Yeah.
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:32.720]   Also most humble.
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:33.720]   You've got the votes, Leo.
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:35.360]   It's a good combination.
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:36.920]   Humble and powerful.
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:37.920]   Nice to see you, Matt.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:38.920]   Thank you.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:41.040]   Thanks to Gina Trapani of Think Up.
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:42.760]   Go to ThinkUp.com and take a look at it.
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:44.440]   It's really great.
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:51.480]   I think it's opening to the public very soon, but it will take your Facebook and your Twitter
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:58.080]   accounts and mong it and give you lots of information.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:55:59.080]   I don't know.
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:01.880]   Does Ein Stalkenganger for it?
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:03.880]   Oh, par?
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:06.480]   And following sound like good descriptions of Leo Le Port.
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:09.640]   Apparently I'm on lists with that name.
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:10.640]   Who followed you?
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:11.840]   Your most popular tweets.
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.520]   What you tweeted in years gone by.
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:14.920]   And there's new stuff all the time.
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:16.240]   It's really great.
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:19.400]   ThinkUp.com and it is, I think you'll be able to get accounts soon.
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:21.360]   Gina's opening that up.
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:27.120]   You can also follow her on Twitter @gina trapani, of course, on Google+ as well.
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:31.600]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:34.360]   He's also the author of Public Parts, a great book.
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:36.320]   What would Google do?
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:41.160]   And we do this weekend Google each and every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern

[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:45.120]   We love it when you're watching.
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.960]   The chatroom is a great way for you to interact with us.
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:51.560]   We obviously pay attention and even refer to the chatroom quite frequently.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:56.200]   But if you can't watch live, you can get the on-demand audio or video downloaded from

[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:12.280]   The Google Music Store, Play Music, and all dogcatcher, all the other podcasts.
