[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.800]   Tom Merritt here sitting in for Leola Port,
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.600]   who's off on holiday vacation, but happy to be back
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.240]   joining Gina Trapani from smarterware.org.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.640]   How you doing, Gina?
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.080]   Great.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.720]   How are you doing?
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.680]   Doing great.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.360]   Happy to be doing this last pre-holiday show.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.600]   Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com also here.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.640]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.040]   Hello there.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.800]   And since it is, I have not done this in a while,
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.320]   but since it is right before Christmas,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.240]   if you need that last minute gift, oh, I don't know.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.720]   Yes.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.240]   Nice.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.520]   For the reader in your family.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.040]   Yes, if you have one, if there are any left.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.240]   The perfect gift for someone who has everything
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.120]   that Jeff's book right there.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.960]   Check it out.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.400]   Exactly.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.600]   All right, let's get into the news.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.880]   The RIAA never hesitates from throwing around some judgments,
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.120]   and they've put out a report card for Google,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.000]   because Google said that they were going to really
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.120]   pay attention to how the search engine works with piracy,
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.800]   because there have been all of these accusations
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.160]   that Google makes all their money off piracy,
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.440]   and they don't do anything to fight it.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.960]   So a year on, the RIAA has graded Google's efforts
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.200]   as incomplete.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.560]   I used to get these in school, actually, an I.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.360]   They didn't give Fs for a while in elementary school.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.280]   I would get an I for incomplete.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.400]   I thought it stood for improving.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.080]   Maybe that's what it did with an elementary school,
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.920]   but with the RIAA.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.400]   Yeah, yeah, the complex your whole life,
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.040]   and you were actually just improving Tom.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.240]   I was just thinking complete.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.120]   I was improving the whole time.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.160]   See, it's the same life as a beta, man.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.520]   No, again.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.120]   You're always incomplete, and you're always improving.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.000]   It means the same thing.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.200]   That's right, exactly.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.080]   You know, as a kid, we just made puns out of it.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.400]   I got an I, and then we pointed our face.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.080]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.440]   Oh, schoolyard wit.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.160]   I can tell.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.080]   That hasn't changed.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.360]   The industry group complains that phrases such as,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.640]   "Lady Gaga MP3 download are still suggested
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.440]   by the auto complete feature of Google Search."
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.240]   And so why should they ever change that?
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.600]   If that's what people are putting in there,
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.280]   that's what the algorithm says.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.680]   Google should not be in a position to edit the auto completes.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.000]   And I download Lady Gaga MP3s from Amazon all the time
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.920]   after I pay for them.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.120]   It's wonderful.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.360]   Lady Gaga MP3 download.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   The first result is EMP3world.com.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.360]   I've known nothing about them.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.080]   Then MP3 raid, then BMP3.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.920]   The Amazon born this way, Lady Gaga MP3 is the fifth result.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.720]   So this is their problem.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.640]   It's not that the auto completes
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.360]   as Lady Gaga MP3 download.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's that you have all of these other sites
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.760]   that we don't know whether they're legit places.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   I mean, it's 15 cents a track.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.160]   And so, of course, Google's job.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.840]   It's not Google's job to go in and edit the web.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.040]   The RIA should go take a lesson from Louis CK.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.840]   - Well, yeah, actually they should adapt their business model.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.520]   I agree.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.720]   But they fault Google for refusing to explicitly prioritize
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.640]   sites with authorized content over unauthorized sites.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   And what comes down to is how do you judge that?
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.120]   How do you as Google decide algorithmically?
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.880]   'Cause it's not a person sitting there
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.240]   indexing all these things.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.640]   How do you decide algorithmically
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.800]   what's authorized and what is it?
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.920]   - And the next thing we're gonna hear
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.680]   is European authorities saying that Google's editing the web
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.360]   and Google has too much authority
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.840]   and Google shouldn't have this much power.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.000]   - Well, yeah, exactly.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.080]   Which is it?
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.000]   Are they an algorithm that indexes without bias?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Or are they going in and tweaking things
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.500]   and making judgments?
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.720]   - Well, I mean, just to play devil's advocate,
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.600]   I mean, Google pull down, was this an AdWords issue?
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.360]   Pull down the links to those pharmacies
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.880]   that were selling drugs and within, you know,
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   inside the US illegally, right?
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.240]   So they had to do that.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.680]   It was incumbent on them to do that.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.600]   So, I mean, the RIA can make the argument
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.160]   that they shouldn't have these sites selling these ringtones.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.680]   It looks like the first result is selling Gaga ringtones.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.000]   I don't know how you judge whether or not that's legal.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.040]   You know, I don't know.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.400]   Is it up to Google to figure that out?
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.920]   I mean, is it incumbent on the RIA to prove
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.960]   that these sites are doing something illegal
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.880]   and take down those sites?
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.400]   Or is it about Google?
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.840]   - I think it's on the RIAA to figure that out.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.280]   Take down those sites if they're doing something illegal.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.120]   - All right.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.960]   - I think you're right, Gina.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.560]   And it actually becomes kind of a precursor to SOPA
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.880]   where if they don't have a black list.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.720]   - Oh wait, no.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.640]   - If the government won't do the black list,
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.320]   then the RIA says Google should be doing the black list.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   - Right, exactly.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.600]   Well, and there is a good question here.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.800]   And I actually, Nila and Leo got into this
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.400]   on this weekend tech this weekend, which is,
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.080]   they're, you know, we say, okay, don't use DRM
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.040]   because that gets in the way.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.560]   And then we say, and don't make Google pull down
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.760]   the unauthorized sites because that's wrong for the algorithm.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.080]   And then we say, don't pass SOPA
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.840]   because that breaks the internet.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.360]   What, what, and I agree with all of those things,
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.160]   but what should they do?
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.200]   I mean, what is the recourse for copyright infringement?
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.280]   And you know, let's get, I think honestly,
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.680]   we need to rethink what copyright means
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.120]   and what deserves protection.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.280]   But short of that, how do we enforce copyright?
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.680]   - Well, the argument from Louis E.K.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.200]   and the argument from Apple iTunes too
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.920]   would be make it easy to buy and generally people will.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.960]   And by the way, when things get, you know,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.880]   Louis said at some point, so I know some of us
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.280]   get pirated, but last count was $750,000.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.040]   And that was two days ago in sales.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.320]   Now he's Louis E.K. and he's beloved and he's great
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.840]   and he's wonderful.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.840]   But at some point, you, as Gina says,
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.320]   you've got to adapt your business model to the future.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.880]   Is it wrong to buy it stuff?
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.760]   Yeah, I think it is, but,
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.720]   but whack-a-mole, man, you're gonna be licking ants
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.360]   off the screen for a long time.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.360]   (laughing)
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.080]   - Right, if there were a lot more sites
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.080]   that offered the MP3, right?
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.840]   If there were a lot more sites that let you download
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.520]   the Gaga MP3 for, you know, a buck 99 or whatever,
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.760]   that they would show up, you know, hire,
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.160]   more people would do it, they'd be more relevant.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.360]   That's, you know, I think that that's one answer for sure.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.760]   - Yeah, why aren't the record companies hosting files
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.640]   and providing an affiliate link situation like Amazon?
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.480]   - Exactly.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.880]   - Or letting Amazon run it.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.520]   - Right, I mean, if people are Googling Lady Gaga
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.320]   MP3 downloads, you know, give them what they want.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.520]   They want the music, give them the music
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.800]   and they'll pay if it's easy and if it's, you know,
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.640]   like I said, I bought all the Gaga stuff through Amazon,
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.480]   actually.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.960]   And you know, listen, there are always people
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.960]   that are gonna steal.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.320]   Oh wait, I mean, if someone's, you know,
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.840]   wants to steal, then they're gonna steal,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.800]   but I think the majority of people,
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.080]   and there's yet to be data about this,
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.840]   but I'd love for us to try to get the data.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.200]   You give people the opportunity to buy something
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.080]   at a fair price and make it easy and, you know,
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.200]   on the up and up, they'll do it.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.280]   - Flood the internet with legitimate links
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.680]   that make you money, play the,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.440]   that's the way the search engine game is played.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.880]   Search engine optimized, drive these other sites off the page.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.200]   - Exactly, and give it to them in a format that they want.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.480]   People are asking specifically for MP3s, right?
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.040]   They don't want to download your crazy proprietary player
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.480]   that, you know, given the MP3, which Amazon does,
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.440]   and several services do, some of the big services,
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.120]   and they'll do it.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.200]   - Now the thing that the RIA paid the most attention to
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.000]   was takedown requests.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.120]   Last year, Google said that the first service
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.560]   to get faster takedowns would be blogger and search,
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.520]   and the RIAA didn't say anything about how well
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.000]   Google kept its promise with respect to those two services,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.400]   which is pretty much admitting that it kept its promise
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.960]   with those two services, but they did criticize
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.920]   Google's management of the Android marketplace,
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.200]   noting that Google doesn't adequately screen apps
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.080]   before accepting them into the app store,
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.520]   also complaining that apps removed from the marketplace
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.360]   aren't automatically blacklisted from AdSense
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.360]   and Google Wallet.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.880]   Two separate issues there.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.160]   One is, I mean, they don't screen apps,
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.560]   that's the whole point of the Android marketplace,
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.400]   should they have to just because the RIAA would like them to?
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.080]   - No, of course not.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.400]   All right, it has a problem with an app.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   They should file a complaint.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.600]   There's channels for filing, problems, complaints,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.440]   bugs, whatever, with different apps, it should do that,
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.800]   and then they should be pulled if it's a legitimate complaint,
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.960]   but Google shouldn't, I mean, that's insane.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.360]   The whole idea of the market is that developers
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.280]   can upload their apps and there isn't this review,
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.640]   you know, that it's an open market.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.040]   - Yeah, and then they finally complain that
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.920]   the tools Google has built have limits on the number
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.520]   of submissions right holders can submit each day,
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.720]   and they don't scale to the scope of piracy online.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.520]   - That's amazing.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.360]   - You know, having recently been the target
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.720]   of a takedown request, it seems like they work well,
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.840]   and but lots of people that didn't even do anything wrong.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.720]   - They're deeply efficient for taking out,
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.320]   you know, legitimate fair use examples.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.160]   - I think the scope is wrong,
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.440]   in that it's like shooting buckshot,
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.960]   trying to hit a bull's eye.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.720]   - Yep.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.560]   - Yep.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.240]   - All right, we've kind of said all of this stuff before,
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.000]   it's nothing new, but there's the report.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.120]   - Tell us a little bitter about the music industry these days.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.240]   - I know, I like Tommy, it's kind of salty about this.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.480]   I like that.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.360]   I mean, clearly the RAA wants to make Google out
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.520]   to be the boogeyman, right?
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.240]   They're, you know, it doesn't shock me at all,
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.640]   they give them a terrible report card.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.280]   I mean, they're using this information to pass things like,
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.720]   well, the RAA is involved in SOPA, is it, are they?
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   I think they are.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.040]   - They're not as high profile.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.360]   The MPA is kind of taking point on that one,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.920]   so they're making all the statements.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.760]   - Right.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.560]   - So. - Right.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.560]   And frankly, I think that we have over-indexed
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.760]   the amount of discussion that needs to be had
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.240]   around the media industry.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.000]   There are people doing actual harm to actual people,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.320]   involving life or death situations,
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.240]   as well as crazy amounts of malware out there,
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.120]   none of which is getting prioritized.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.800]   You don't see the committee in Congress pushing
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.920]   at the last minute before the holidays
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.520]   to put in an anti-malware bill.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.360]   - Yeah, right.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.160]   - Which would actually protect people.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.840]   - They don't protect people, they protect institutions.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.680]   - That's right.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.840]   Well, that's very obvious lately.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.920]   - Yep.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.000]   - Google renewed their search deal for Firefox.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.160]   - So this is good news for Firefox.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.240]   - And for Google.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.080]   - 80 plus percent of their money from the search deal
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.920]   with Google, although there was talk
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.680]   that there's a Bing version of Firefox,
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.680]   meaning they could have gone to Bing and got that money.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.280]   So Jeff, I think you're right.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.560]   This may be a better thing for Google
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.480]   because it keeps them in a large browser footprint.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.800]   - I was asked today, and I don't even know.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.160]   I know the Chrome has now passed Firefox,
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.160]   but where does Firefox, where do they stand against IE
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.000]   in market share?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.080]   Does anybody know?
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.000]   - I just recently dipped under 50% of the marketplace.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.640]   - Right, and that was a big deal, first time
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.160]   in 10 years or something, right?
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.800]   - I thought it was below 50%.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.160]   Yeah, I thought that IE just, I'm just from memory.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.000]   I thought IE just went below 50%,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.360]   and then it's Firefox and Chrome.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.960]   And has Chrome surpassed Firefox at this point?
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.040]   - It's a specific statistic in a certain way
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.080]   that you count it in the United States.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.840]   Chrome has passed Firefox.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.200]   I think in the general, it's still Firefox is better.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   - Then back it back.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.520]   - Okay, there's a number of examples.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.880]   - No, there's both of them against Microsoft,
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.160]   which is I think why it makes sense for them to be together.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.720]   And Google kind of has to,
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.120]   you know, well, the great thing about,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.880]   even though I'm a Chrome user now, I like Chrome,
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.240]   Firefox's presence is very good for the market.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.800]   And Google's supporting that in a tangible way,
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.080]   I think is a good thing, and it pushes the competition.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.440]   It's not unlike that time when Microsoft invested in Apple
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.400]   when it needed help.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.360]   Keeping Firefox alive I think is good for everybody.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.600]   - Yeah, I mean, we talked about this on Tech News Today
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.160]   under the auspices of, is this a problem for Google
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.400]   for antitrust because they're under so many antitrust
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.840]   investigations to go into Firefox means that there they are
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.640]   in another place dominating, but at the same time,
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.560]   if they-- - It's in their supporting
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.080]   their survival. - If they don't, yeah.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.880]   Then they're just giving over market share
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.720]   to somebody else.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.160]   - It's sort of sad though to put it that way.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.520]   They're supporting in their survival.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.760]   It's like, you know, Firefox is largest source of revenue,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.200]   has a competing browser.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.080]   I mean, if Firefox had had Google and went to Bing,
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.160]   it would have been the death knell for any power user,
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.360]   nerd, you know, maybe not the death knell.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.840]   You can always change your search engine, right?
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.320]   - Yeah, you can change it to Bing right now, to ding.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.400]   - Yeah, you can change it to Bing right now, exactly.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.240]   But I feel bad about Firefox actually kind of getting
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.520]   trampled by Chrome in a way.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.160]   I love Chrome and I use Chrome.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   I just remember kind of when Firefox came out
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.080]   and people loved it and started to switch and getting people
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.800]   to switch their default browser seemed like an impossible
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.000]   feat that it would just would never happen.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.320]   And it happened and Firefox proved that that could happen.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.360]   And I don't know, I feel, I feel kind of bad.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.880]   - According to the chat counter,
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.560]   Chrome had 25.69% of the global browser market in November,
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.680]   Firefox 25.23.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.680]   Net applications has Chrome with 18.18%
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.520]   and Firefox 22.14.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.080]   So it depends on who's counting.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.920]   - Right.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.600]   - Gina, I think the answer to the hegemony
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.960]   of the big companies is more open source products,
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.000]   is more Apaches and Firefoxes and Linuxes.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.080]   And that says I feel a little guilty liking Chrome
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.280]   'cause we need to support these other things.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.120]   I download Firefox, I use it here and there,
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.320]   but I think that that's our answer as an open net.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.080]   Even though I'm a Google fan boy,
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.400]   I don't want Google to own the world.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.720]   I certainly don't want Microsoft to.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.320]   I don't want Twitter to.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.680]   The more we have open platforms,
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.040]   the better up we all are.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.640]   - Yeah, I actually tried to switch to Firefox recently
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.560]   because of the improvements with tab management
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.720]   and responsive this.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.000]   And for a while I was enjoying it.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.080]   And I was like, oh yeah, I like this.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.720]   I can use no script again.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.240]   I can use a bunch of other add-ons for security.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.440]   And then after a couple weeks,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.440]   the tab management just bogged down.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.640]   And I don't know if it's that I need to keep
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.840]   restarting Firefox to clear out the memory,
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.920]   but I went back to Chrome.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.080]   - You know, like Chrome has been bogging down lately.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.480]   It's something opens up in some window
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.560]   and then it just starts,
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.680]   (growling)
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.120]   "I've got to re-watch it,"
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.200]   which is fairly new for me.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.440]   - That has been happening to me
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.480]   when I have spreadsheets,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.720]   which I always have open
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.840]   'cause we do all our run downs in there.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.960]   Every once in a while,
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.760]   it will suddenly just take forever for it
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.400]   to open the new tabs
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.880]   and everything else grinds to a halt.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.160]   And then that just goes away.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.360]   I don't know what it is.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.480]   It may not even be a Chrome issue.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.320]   It may be some other operating system
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.400]   or internet issue, I don't know.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.760]   But. - Yeah.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.600]   Firefox's extensions are still better
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.400]   and for power users who do,
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.000]   like I watch Firefox when I want to use down the mall,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.280]   which is my favorite download manager.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.880]   Firebug is available in Chrome,
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.160]   but it's not quite as rich as it is in Firefox.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.480]   But these are pretty strong power uses for edge cases.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.880]   But that's what I launched Firefox.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.680]   And I think, oh, this is pretty new
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.760]   and maybe I'll try and stick to it.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.720]   And then I just,
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.400]   I wind up back at Chrome.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.600]   - I'll also continue to use Firefox for archive.org
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.600]   because there's a bug that happens every once in a while
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.160]   in Chrome when I upload something to archive,
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.920]   it never redirects to my page.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.680]   And of course, the search engine hasn't indexed yet.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.360]   So I have to wait like a half hour
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.360]   before I can find the thing that I just uploaded.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.720]   Whereas in Firefox, it never fails.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.160]   It always goes and redirect.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.480]   - Oh.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.320]   - That's still weird.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.120]   That's a weird bug though.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.640]   Google Plus got some improvements
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.280]   right before the new year.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.200]   Pump up or down the volume.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.400]   This is from the Google Plus blog post.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.520]   - The scolbelable feature.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.000]   - Yeah, so you can sort of,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.840]   this is interesting.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.080]   It's not just a mute.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.360]   You know, I love scolbelables posts on Google Plus though.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.840]   I made that joke one day,
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.720]   but that's because I was reading all these posts.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.880]   I'm like, wow, Google Plus is great.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.440]   And I realized like nine of the things I'd read
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.280]   were from scolbel.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.240]   But it's good, but you can just--
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.760]   - This week in scolbel, you can show.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.040]   - You can add controls that enable you to fine-tune
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.320]   your stream so that certain people show up less often
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.520]   than others as it blends that make--
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.520]   - It's in seep or circles.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.200]   - Isn't it circle, isn't that--
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.280]   - For viewing the stream for a particular circle,
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.800]   you'll now see a slider at the top
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.880]   that lets you adjust how post from that circle,
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   you're right, Jeff, should be blended--
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.280]   - But you could make scolbelable his own circle,
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.800]   which of course deserves to be.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.360]   But otherwise it circles, I think.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.800]   Yeah, and I haven't gotten it yet.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.160]   - Yeah, I haven't either.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.960]   So I haven't been-- - I haven't gotten it yet.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.800]   - This is interesting.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.640]   You know, I keep a VIP Twitter list of people whose tweets
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.680]   I absolutely don't want to miss
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.840]   and I will scroll back and actually read it.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.760]   It's a very small group of people.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.400]   - I, well, it's a private list.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.720]   But I kind of do a similar thing on Google Plus.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.000]   I have this inner circle where I want to see every single post
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.360]   and I really love that I can say,
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.240]   turn up the volume all the way on these
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.200]   and the rest I'm okay with just sort of being,
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.760]   you know, the stream flowing by
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.160]   and if I miss a day, no big deal.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.400]   So, but if it's on a per circle basis,
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.000]   if Jeff is in my inner circle
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.560]   and also my really loud noisy people circle,
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.720]   if I turn down the volume on one up on the other,
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.920]   I wonder what it does.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.840]   So I have not yet, so I'm not sure.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.840]   But I like this, this is kind of a Twitter problem.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.680]   - I haven't. - Oh, you do.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.520]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.000]   So I've never used it before.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.600]   So okay, I got it.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.040]   - So you're turning down your friends?
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.960]   - I'm gonna turn down my friends.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.080]   I know what that means. - That's the way she is.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.680]   I hear from them all the time.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.480]   - But nothing's, I don't see anything changing.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.240]   - Well, it doesn't happen immediately.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.200]   - Yeah, I know what happens is
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.880]   that it's gonna feed in more to your mainstream.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.080]   - I see.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.760]   - So you're big stream proper.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.600]   - Okay. - So this is like
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.600]   Facebook top stories, except you get to,
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.440]   you get to graphic equalize them.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.640]   You get to play with the setting sliders.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.840]   - Yeah, it could be me, but go ahead, Tom.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.360]   - No, no, I'm just, I was gonna say,
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.880]   it sounds pretty cool, but I wanna play with it
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.040]   to see how it works first.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.880]   - Yeah.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.520]   I've been noticing, you know, I like Google+,
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.880]   and I abandoned it for about a week
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.840]   because it was traveling, and I wasn't in there much,
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.520]   and I gained less conversation there now.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:14.000]   I wonder if it penalized me and put me in streams less.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.160]   And I got less noticed as a result.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.600]   'Cause what this reveals is, of course,
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.840]   you're not, the stream is not complete.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.760]   The stream is some product of an algorithm.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.920]   And, you know, who gets put in your stream how much?
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.360]   So even though the number of followers has gone up,
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.480]   my conversations have gone on,
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.920]   either that or I'm just saying stupid to ask things.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.840]   (laughing)
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.280]   - Well, I love how this is so reflective
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.720]   of the Facebook and Google+'s different approaches, right?
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.000]   Like Facebook figures out kind of auto-detects
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.320]   who your list should be and tries to do it for you,
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.160]   and tries to figure out your top stories for you.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.840]   And Google's like, here are all the sliders
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.840]   and buttons and circles, and just drag this here.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.200]   Like you set this up for yourself.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.040]   - Yeah.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.760]   And I prefer having more control,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.320]   but it is definitely very different approaches to it.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.400]   - I do like the fact that it's not an all or nothing.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.520]   Again, there's a couple people on Twitter that I've blocked,
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.120]   and I didn't really want to block.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.600]   I just kind of wanted to turn them down,
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.040]   and this would have been perfect for that.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.840]   - That's really true. - Yes.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.240]   - Also, redesigned Google Bar,
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.920]   where the red notifications indicator is.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.720]   One thing I've noticed, I don't think it was part
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.240]   of this update, but you actually get the actual number
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.600]   instead of maxing out at nine,
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.680]   which is a little different.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.640]   But they also have changed the notification,
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.280]   so you get a little more information about what's in them
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.720]   before you kind of had to click through with a lot of them
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.120]   to see what they were actually saying.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.400]   Now, as you can see in ILEANs, you get a little summary,
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.760]   a little bit more one liner about what's going on,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.080]   so you don't have to click all the way in.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.160]   - Right, so instead of saying someone plus one,
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.680]   your post, it shows you the content of your post
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.760]   and says someone plus one this.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.040]   So you know what post it is without having a click over
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.720]   to the side or expand it.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.640]   That's nice, that's handy.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.480]   - Yeah, that is.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.480]   I mean, a lot of times I would click in just because I'm like,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.200]   I don't understand what this notification is about,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.280]   then I'm clicking and be like, oh, that's all it was?
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.080]   Oh. - Right, I was having that experience too.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.840]   Like really, I just clicked to find out
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.680]   that a couple of people plus one,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.640]   it felt like, why did I get bothered for this?
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.960]   So this seems like just a better information density,
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.520]   kind of one view.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.600]   - And your pages for brands.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.920]   - So this is actually the scoble fix.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.720]   - You can now delegate up to 50 managers
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.000]   as administrators for a page.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.360]   Remember when they launched pages,
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.920]   it was one page per person.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.040]   So now I can bring in all my co-hosts on shows
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.280]   and the brand pages.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.200]   A new notification flow will ensure
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.560]   that these managers stay in the loop
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.400]   on all the activity that takes place on a given page,
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.840]   so the managers know what's going on.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.800]   And they'll show an aggregated count of users
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.280]   that have engaged with your page, a little metric,
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.040]   either by plus one or by adding it to a circle.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.280]   So you can get an at a glance summary
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.280]   of who has been visiting your page and interacting with it.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.240]   - So nice changes.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.000]   They do keep developing the thing.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.800]   - Yeah, some stuff. - Yeah, I mean,
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.200]   December is usually a slow month, right?
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.840]   But not on the Google+ team, it sounds like.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.040]   And also some photos, the photo updates.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.440]   - Yeah. - Yeah, they improved that somehow, right?
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.160]   - Doing a photo in lightbox has been completely redesigned
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.640]   with improved navigation, enhanced comment, legibility,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.200]   and just better overall utility, they say.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.760]   - And how many times have time for the holidays?
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.800]   - Well, yeah, and so many photographers use Google+
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.080]   that's gonna be it. - I've wondered whether that was,
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.680]   that was on purpose or whether that was accidental.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.280]   Did they plan for Trey Ratcliffe to make it great for him
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.320]   or did Trey Ratcliffe come in and make Google+
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.600]   a great place for photographers?
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.560]   - It's a good question.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.920]   That's a very good question.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.360]   It's probably more of Trey than Google,
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.360]   but I wouldn't say that they didn't have that in mind
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.440]   as one of the uses.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.520]   - But boy, photographers do love it, and it's great.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.240]   It makes it so visual and fun.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.240]   - I jokingly get angry every time I see Trey's amazing pictures.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.000]   Because it stops me in my tracks.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.680]   I'm like, "I'll just look at Google+ for a second."
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.920]   Then I'm like, "Wow, look at that."
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.000]   And I get totally sucked in.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.080]   - I've gotta throw out my brownie.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.480]   - Yeah.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.000]   - All right, let's take a quick break
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   before we get to some Android news
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.520]   and thank our sponsor Ford.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.720]   One of the great parts of Ford's Sync is AppLink.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.400]   This week in Google, of course, brought to you by Ford.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.120]   And we recently took Sync AppLink for a test drive.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.960]   Check it out.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:32.520]   - Yeah, here we go.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.200]   (laughing)
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.040]   - Hey, Tom Merritt here,
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.600]   taking off from the Twit Brick House
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.400]   and we're gonna jump into the 2012 Ford Fiesta
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.000]   to try out Sync AppLink.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.560]   Now, Sync AppLink lets you use apps like Pandora
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.880]   with simple voice commands.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.080]   So you keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:58.720]   All right, so we're going to see how Pandora works with Sync.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.200]   Plug in the phone here by USB.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.680]   And then we're gonna say.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.560]   - Bling in, please say a command.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.560]   - Mobile apps.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.960]   - Mobile apps, please say a command.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.200]   Pandora.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:19.160]   Now it immediately goes right to the channel that I had,
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.880]   which was a classical music channel.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.000]   I really feel like that right now.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.160]   So let's change that.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:28.840]   Play station, Uncle Tupelo radio.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.080]   (laughing)
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.720]   There we go, that's better.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.160]   All right, let's hit the road.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.920]   (dramatic music)
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.720]   And you can do all kinds of things with voice commands.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.240]   You can bookmark a song, thumbs up, thumbs down,
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.880]   create a new channel from an artist while it's playing.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.480]   All those things you probably shouldn't do
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.440]   while you're driving if you're doing them by the app,
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.280]   but you can do them safely by keeping your eyes on the road
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.880]   and your hands on the wheel.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.880]   All right, we're here.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.240]   So that's how Ford Sync with AppLink
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.160]   allows you to play Pandora with simple voice commands
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.800]   while you keep your eyes on the road
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.080]   and your hands on the wheel.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.640]   Of course, it's available on the 2012 Ford Fiesta
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.760]   and you can learn more at Ford.com/technology.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.400]   - And of course, we thank Ford for their support.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.240]   - Good work, Tom.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.320]   - This week in Google, thank you.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.160]   - Yeah, nice.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.000]   - Those were fun to see.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.160]   - Have you made, have you guys made a commercial like that
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.000]   before?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:28.840]   - No, this is the first time.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.720]   Leo and I both did versions of all the different stuff.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.960]   They're played all this week.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.400]   So yeah, yeah.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.040]   - I like them, I think it's pretty great.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.880]   - Good, thanks man.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.960]   - Google's Andy Rubin trumpeting Android activations
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.120]   and making it clear what Android activations are,
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.840]   they're up to 700,000, wait, am I reading this right?
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.720]   700,000 per day?
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.280]   Per day, 700,000 per day.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.920]   And he makes it clear when he says activation,
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.480]   he means someone went into a store,
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.600]   bought an Android phone and activated it.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.920]   And it doesn't involve used ones.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.760]   Once a phone's been activated, it's been counted
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.800]   and they never counted again.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.440]   - That's big number.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.360]   - That's huge.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.200]   - It's huge.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.040]   - It's huge.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.920]   - I was actually just waiting for the page to load
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.360]   to make sure I got it right.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:25.440]   - Wait a second here, 7,000 times 356 equals 249 million a year.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:31.320]   Do we believe that?
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.440]   - Does that add up?
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.720]   - Does it add up?
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.320]   It seems almost...
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.600]   - That doesn't work.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.200]   - Good, true.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.560]   - I mean, if they were duping,
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.440]   if used to Android's that got activated somehow worked,
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.960]   there are now over 700,000 Android devices activated
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.240]   every day, worldwide, I guess.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.440]   Still, huge.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.280]   - Still.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.120]   - Yeah.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:54.960]   - That doesn't.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.800]   I guess maybe he didn't say--
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.640]   - So what's the latest?
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.320]   - Every day he said one Wednesday.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.600]   (laughing)
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.000]   - One Wednesday, just before Christmas,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:05.840]   the last day he--
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.680]   - There's a real lot.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.520]   - And for those wondering,
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.680]   we count each device only once.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.680]   Activations means you go into a store, buy a device
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.120]   and put it on the network
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.160]   by subscribing to a wireless service.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.520]   So Eileen, Samsung Galaxy S2 wouldn't count
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.400]   'cause she just popped a SIM card in it.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.920]   That's not activating it.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.320]   - So it's 700,000 in one.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.640]   (laughing)
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.440]   - If you count your Galaxy S2.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.840]   The chat room says that he did the same thing last year
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.040]   and that this was a current shopping season number,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.120]   which is a good point, but even so.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.600]   - Okay, so it's a spike right now.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.480]   - And I also got the wrong number of days in a year.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.160]   (laughing)
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.000]   - So fast change.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.520]   - Which planet were you using as your year?
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.960]   That's, you know, makes it different.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.520]   - One of the new planets, yeah.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.080]   I was off on the new planet, which is new science news.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.280]   You see how current I am?
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.200]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.400]   (laughing)
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.880]   It'll be interesting to see what this number goes to,
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.360]   but remember the last time he talked about it,
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.880]   it was 550,000 per day.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.000]   And I think we were having the same reaction.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.240]   How could that possibly be true?
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.760]   So it just keeps going up.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.760]   All right, Samsung Galaxy Nexus prices already slashed.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.480]   - With the contract.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.120]   - With the contract, of course.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.520]   - Without.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.560]   - We got one here, the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.720]   It's monstrous.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.240]   Have you guys got a chance to look at it
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.480]   or mess around with it?
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.800]   - I haven't, I got the ice cream sandwich on my Nexus S.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.720]   So I've been sort of preoccupied just with that,
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.280]   but I haven't had a chance to get my hands on like Galaxy Nexus.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.520]   Is it much bigger than the,
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.600]   what was the phone but right before that?
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.800]   - Well, I have the Nexus S.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.640]   - Right, the Nexus S.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.800]   So compare with the Nexus S, is it?
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.880]   - It's, this is it.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.720]   You can hide it.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.560]   - Yep.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.400]   - It's big.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.240]   - Yeah.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.080]   - It's rather large.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.400]   It's fine for me.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.840]   It's a little heavier than the Galaxy S2.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.680]   - Well, I think Leo's review on your new wonderful gadget show.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.520]   - Yes.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.640]   - Was very, very good.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.760]   'Cause it was, it was, it was more of a follow-up
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.680]   to what he did last week on this show
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.640]   where he went in a little more depth and said,
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.640]   "Woo, not sure."
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.080]   - Yeah, I know Eileen likes it.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.480]   - I love it.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.880]   - So why disagree with him?
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.400]   - Why are they slicing the prices down so much?
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.960]   Is it because there's more people--
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.800]   - They gotta get 700,000 a day, man.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.840]   You gotta, you gotta--
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.040]   - You gotta make it under volume.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.440]   - $155 after an instant rebate
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.160]   and a $75 off coupon code plus contract.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.160]   - You know, here's the problem with it.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.520]   So I still have idiot that I am
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.440]   my seven inch Galaxy Tab, right?
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.360]   Which now has prehistoric--
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.560]   - Is it like a Claire Fro-Yo Fro-Yo?
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.920]   - Oh, it's, it's what was the B?
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.760]   You know, it's--
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.000]   - B.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   There was no B.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.840]   It was just coffee.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.000]   - Butterscotch, I don't know.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.840]   - Oh, I'm kidding.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.200]   (laughing)
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.520]   - It's the Fred Flintstone version, whatever that is.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.000]   And so I said, okay, this is ridiculous.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.200]   I'm paying $44 a month.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.680]   I'm not using it.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.200]   I want something new, but I'm just gonna get rid of this.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.400]   And of course, I've got a two year contract.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.720]   $200 to get rid of this.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.720]   And it is out of date.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.360]   It is permanently, awfully, horribly out of date.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.040]   So I appealed to T-Mobile.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.440]   I had to email them to appeal the $200 cancellation fee,
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.560]   but it just makes you say never, never, never again a contract.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.560]   - It's a lot more expensive, but it feels better.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.880]   - It does.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.680]   So I looked up the prices.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.840]   I'm gonna see if I can't get out of the contract.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.200]   I wanna take the sim out of this one and put it in,
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.160]   'cause my phone, of course, is the Nexus One,
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.960]   which is even earlier.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.120]   - No, but that's classic.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.280]   That's like, that's good.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.240]   The Nexus One is a great handset.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.760]   - I'm delighted with it, but I went on Amazon
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.440]   and you can buy unlocked.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.280]   I don't know what the trick is,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.600]   but you could buy unlocked a lot of Android handsets
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.280]   that are not that far back.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.000]   And so for less than $200,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.520]   I can buy a whole new handset, put the sim in it, get the data.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.800]   And I'll be a little less mad at myself.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   - Yep, yep.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.000]   So Leo panned Ice Cream Sandwich,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.160]   or he panned the handset or was the combination of both.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.360]   - Yeah, it was both.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.480]   - So first, I'm really sad for my Nexus One owner friends,
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.960]   and I have several 'cause that's a great handset,
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.280]   that they're not getting Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.840]   That really stinks.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.080]   But I have an XSS and I got Ice Cream Sandwich,
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.240]   and I love it.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.520]   I am gonna disagree with Leo on this as well,
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.200]   and I'm with Eileen.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.040]   - Yay, Gina.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.720]   - It's really great.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.560]   I mean, the visual refresh is amazing.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.880]   It feels like a totally different phone.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.800]   This is just straight up Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.640]   And the only thing I don't like about the visual refresh
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.400]   is that things feel a little flat,
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.120]   so it's hard to tell where to tap.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.760]   I'm still sort of getting used to it,
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.480]   but there's so many great new features.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.360]   Like I love all the new camera stuff.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.080]   The Gmail app is awesome.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.800]   I'm a widget girl, so I love that you can scroll widgets now
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.800]   and resize widgets.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   Like I have my calendar kind of on my home screen.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.160]   I think there are a lot of really great things
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.760]   about Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.040]   I'm really excited for apps to catch up to ICS
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.320]   so that they take advantage of the action bar
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.400]   and all the kind of new stuff.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.120]   And ICS, but for, if you've got a handset,
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.200]   if you've got an Android handset,
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.800]   to go from gingerbread to Ice Cream Sandwich is a huge leap
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.000]   'cause you're hopping over Honeycomb, essentially.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:19.960]   So I really love it.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.320]   And I was surprised that Leo,
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.920]   I heard a few people on Twitter said that they didn't like
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.760]   that Leo hand it so quickly 'cause he hadn't been,
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.040]   you know, used it for very long.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.920]   And I mean, I've had, I've been using it pretty steadily
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.160]   since Saturday and I'm still discovering stuff.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.000]   I just figured out how to take a screenshot on it today.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.240]   I was kind of excited about that.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.080]   The panoramic stuff in the camera is great.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.040]   I'm not a camera buff.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.320]   I'm not gonna doubt, I'm not gonna, you know,
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.200]   search the market for a camera app with panoramic,
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.360]   but now that it's just built into the regular camera,
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.960]   I've taken a bunch of panoramic photos,
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.680]   especially now at the holidays.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.160]   So I'm thinking Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.000]   - How's your battery?
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.440]   - Battery seems about the same.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.800]   I have an extra battery.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.280]   I bought an extra battery a while ago
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.560]   and I carry it with me just because, you know,
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.880]   that's, I've sort of accepted that that's what I have to do.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.640]   I mean, all my iPhone friends have those
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.280]   juice pack things anyway.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.000]   It seems, it's the same for me.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   It seems about the same.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.440]   - I was like, do you miss your iPhone friends?
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.440]   What about the other, with my old eyes Gina?
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.280]   - Yes.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.120]   - With screen res, what Leo said,
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.320]   and what I've seen elsewhere is that the type really
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.960]   does resolve pretty damn small.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.600]   Is it you trying to play with all heart rate?
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.360]   Or do you have young, vibrant eyes?
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.640]   - I don't, I don't want to sound ages.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.720]   I don't have a problem with it with the title.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.840]   I really like the type of time I haven't had a hard time
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.680]   reading it.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.520]   It does actually get small.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.560]   Not that you say so.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.640]   It is kind of small, but isn't this,
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.920]   this has to be configurable.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.040]   There are so many settings on this one.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.320]   I feel like I'm still discovering how many settings there are.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.920]   I'd be surprised if you couldn't change that.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.760]   I love you.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.600]   - What was your biggest?
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.680]   - You could swipe off the notifications.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.520]   - Yeah.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.360]   - Swiping off the notifications.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.200]   - I mean, what was your biggest and plain?
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.040]   - Swiping off the notifications.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.800]   - Well, he didn't like anything.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   He doesn't like, he doesn't like the soft buttons.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:08.480]   He doesn't like, he doesn't like the look.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.520]   He likes the apps.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.600]   He likes the updated apps.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.240]   He hates the task manager.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.200]   - He hates the task manager?
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   - He hates it, yeah.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.600]   If you go to that, he can't stand that.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.080]   What else?
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.360]   I mean, I can't even remember anything that he really likes
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.960]   other than the updated apps.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.960]   I said, well, what about Gmail?
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.680]   Oh, and he likes voice recognition.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.480]   The voice recognition is much better on this on ICs.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.320]   - Yeah, that was very impressive.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.360]   - Yeah, that was really nice.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.400]   And you know, the text response is super cool.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.320]   I can't use it 'cause I'm Google voice full time
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.560]   and it sends it from your actual phone number.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.800]   Which I said about it.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.840]   I'm hoping that Google voice is gonna work with that.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.160]   You know, when someone, when you get an incoming call,
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.600]   you can kind of swipe up and say, hey, you know,
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.200]   text back immediately.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.120]   Hey, can I call you later?
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.880]   Some menu of responses, which is cool.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.840]   The visual refresh is really beautiful.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.920]   Although, as I said, it's very flat.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.560]   So there's no depth to any of the buttons or anything.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.280]   So I, at first, I had a little bit of a hard time.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.440]   I was like, where do I tap?
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.480]   Because I was just used to having buttons
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.600]   that have a little, you know, 3D feel to them.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.040]   But you get used to that quickly.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.920]   And some of the settings do feel buried.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.040]   Like I said, I'm on the Nexus S,
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.720]   so I have all my old buttons
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.560]   that the Galaxy Nexus doesn't have anymore.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.400]   - There it is.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.800]   There's Nexus S with ICS there.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.760]   I think my biggest, maybe my biggest beef with him is
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.920]   he said, unlike what you just said, Gina,
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.640]   is that this is not a huge improvement.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.320]   And I completely disagree with him.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.160]   Yeah, I disagree.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.000]   - I disagree. - I disagree.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.160]   - It is, it is.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.480]   Especially for some, for hands, I mean,
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.760]   unless you've had a honeycomb tablet,
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.280]   not a lot of people have.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   Yeah, this is a really big improvement.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.920]   I think even from honeycomb, it's quite an improvement.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.320]   - If I were gonna buy a phone
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.360]   other than this one to get ice cream sandwich,
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.600]   what phone should that be?
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.080]   - Well, I mean, the only,
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.960]   the only one with the only choices right now
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.080]   are the Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus, right?
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:09.000]   The T-Mobile Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.960]   I think are the only two phones that have it.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.520]   - Right.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.360]   Well, and all the other phones are going to get them eventually,
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.480]   but we don't have dates, we don't know one.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.440]   And that's always, you know, that's only a risk.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.960]   - My advice for someone who's looking to buy a phone right now
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:27.280]   would be to just wait a few months for the ice cream sandwich
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.360]   to come out on more handsets and also for the other apps
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.680]   to catch up to the ice cream sandwich, visual design
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.680]   and incorporate the features that it has
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.400]   'cause then you'll get kind of the best of both.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.440]   So, you know, if your contract is up right now
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.000]   and you're dying for a phone, I love the Nexus S.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.640]   - Tell me which one has physical buttons.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.120]   That's the thing that I think is so funny
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.200]   when people complain about this.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.880]   And I know it's because you're used to using it
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.400]   in a certain way, but the physical buttons on the Nexus S
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.720]   aren't physical buttons.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.560]   - They're not physical buttons.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.360]   - They're just sort of touch screens that are embedded
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.720]   and never go away.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.560]   - Right.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.680]   - The buttons on ice cream sandwich on the Nexus S,
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.960]   the Galaxy Nexus, I mean, look just like the physical buttons.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.200]   They just happen to be on the screen and they go away sometimes.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.200]   - And there are fewer of them, aren't there?
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.040]   - Yeah, there's three.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:11.880]   - There's three in the Galaxy Nexus,
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.920]   so there's three in the Galaxy Nexus
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.760]   and then four on the Nexus S.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.680]   - You're missing the search on the,
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.200]   you have the search on Nexus S.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.040]   - The search, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.360]   - And they're both pure Android experience
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.000]   except that Verizon doesn't have the wallet, right?
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.840]   - Well, no, it does have the wallet now.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.280]   - Well, it doesn't come with the wallet.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.120]   - Right, you have to put it in it.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.000]   - You have to go get it and put it side-loaded,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.600]   but it will work.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.160]   - What's the, I didn't get a chance to watch
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.840]   the Ninja Galaxy Nexus unboxing.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.640]   - Well, this is from Matt.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.520]   - This is the one that Matt cuts out of, so I did.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.400]   - I couldn't figure it out.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.120]   - It's a game.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.160]   - Or is that what it is?
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.240]   - Yeah, here.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.680]   - Oh, I get it.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.480]   I waited for something to happen.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.560]   (laughing)
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.400]   - Trust the X.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.640]   (screaming)
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.160]   - And then the whole page goes 8-bit.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.840]   And then you just start playing.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:08.840]   - Oh, I see.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.400]   So you're unboxing the Nexus.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.240]   - The Nexus.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.800]   - The Nexus as part of the 8-bit Ninja.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   - Right, and I'm terrible at this.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.200]   I try playing this.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.040]   - It's HTML5.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.880]   - Oh, here we go.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.680]   Okay, okay, it's kick, okay.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.800]   - Oh, nothing happened for me.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.640]   I get it now.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.080]   - You watch it, and now you start playing.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.760]   (screaming)
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.320]   - Why are we fighting a white Ninja?
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.680]   - We're trying to get to the box, is that what's going on?
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.320]   (screaming)
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.280]   - It's the objective.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.120]   - What's that?
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:40.960]   - What's my motivation?
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.760]   - This is how this is Matt Kutz's.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.920]   He is the Ninja.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   (laughing)
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.240]   That's why he likes it so much.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.240]   - Oh.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.080]   - That's it.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.920]   That's what it is.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.760]   We figured it's unmasking.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.600]   - You've unmasked it.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.800]   - Outspammers, Matt.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.720]   Calm, quiet, nice, Matt sees himself as a Ninja.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.560]   I get it now.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.720]   He's on your ceiling right now.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.720]   He didn't even know.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.000]   (laughing)
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.840]   - All right, Google sticks the DEXUS S ice cream sandwich
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:13.240]   update back in the freezer, says in gadget.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.040]   Apparently, not everybody was able to get it.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.760]   - That's because you know which, yeah.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.080]   - Some people are still able to get it.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.880]   Other people have not.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.960]   And according to a statement from Google Community Manager,
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.560]   Paul Wilcox, if you received an update notification
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.320]   a little while ago, but the update isn't currently available
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.160]   for your phone.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.920]   This is likely the result of Google pausing the update
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.440]   in your area while we monitor feedback.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.680]   - I downloaded it manually from like the XDA developers.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.640]   You know, it was a rock and Saturday night here
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.800]   in New York City.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.640]   - Good times.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.760]   - I have to have this right now and I will get it.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.600]   There's no way I could wait.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.520]   Google TV made me wait too long.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.120]   So I just went for it with the next assess.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.880]   But so you, I mean, I think that you probably can still
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.600]   if you Google where to find the zip file.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.440]   It's sort of a pain.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.280]   And I probably wouldn't recommend doing that.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.880]   I just wait for the update to come.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.960]   You'll get it.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.800]   But it makes sense for Google that they'd pause.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.480]   But you know, if you're an Android enthusiast,
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.480]   you're gonna be like me.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.760]   You're just not gonna want to wait.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.000]   But you can do it manually.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:16.920]   And it's not that difficult.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.000]   You don't have to have your phone doesn't have to be rooted
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.320]   to begin with, which is nice.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.160]   - Well, okay.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.800]   That was gonna be my question is if you have to root.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.680]   So if, yeah, you can just find the zip file.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.520]   You can put it on.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.360]   - Find the zip file.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.400]   You move it to your phone's SD card.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.720]   Then you boot up your phone, you hold up the volume button
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.000]   power, and then you just say, hey, you know,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.040]   run this, you know, bootloader and you're good.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.000]   And it runs.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.480]   - The International Trade Commission has ruled that
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:45.000]   HTAC infringed upon one of Apple's patents.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.040]   But that one is still a win.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.680]   They have until April to work around the patent
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.040]   they found to be violating, or HTC will no longer be able
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.480]   to sell their phones in the United States.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.640]   That's how people sometimes freak out when they hear that.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.720]   ITC rules this way quite a lot, and usually the company
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.120]   gets plenty of time, like they did in this case,
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.520]   and are able to work around it.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.920]   HTC says they already have the solution,
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.720]   so they don't even need until April 19th,
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.680]   but they get a lot of time.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.040]   What does this mean for Android though?
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.080]   It's another loss.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.840]   Now, there are more than one patent here,
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.680]   but they lost on one.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.520]   We're still kind of waiting for Google to get Motorola
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.920]   in the house.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.320]   Will this sort of stuff change when that happens?
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.280]   - I don't know.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.920]   Doesn't this then become dominoes from HTC
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.760]   to the other manufacturers in Google itself?
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.080]   HTC is just the victim in the crosshairs, right?
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.400]   - Well, yeah, one would think,
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.440]   although it depends on whether that particular patent
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.800]   is easily proved to be a problem.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.920]   Remember, there were other patents here
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.080]   that they were found not to be violating.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.600]   And Apple, unlike--
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.520]   - HTC said they were gonna develop around it,
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.640]   but that's probably another forked version of Android.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.960]   - Is it?
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.960]   Gina, do you know?
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.840]   Does that mean they have to fork Android
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.320]   if they work around this stuff?
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.240]   Is it, I don't know enough about the patent
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.240]   that was found to be violated to know
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:10.480]   if that is something that is core?
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.040]   Like if I'm using a stock Android,
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.600]   is that also going to be violating this?
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.520]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.360]   I'm not sure.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.600]   So it looks like this patent refers to a method of data detection
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   that allows a mobile device to recognize things
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.200]   like email addresses and phone numbers,
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.040]   and move them to a relevant, like the dialer app
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.040]   or your email app on your phone.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.400]   This just frustrates me so much
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.360]   because it's just like, this is not,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.800]   this is just, you know, it gets me crazy.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.640]   This is crazy.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.920]   So you tap that phone number and it launches the dialer app.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.720]   And so this is the patent that Apple says that it had
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.280]   and that Android shouldn't have.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.320]   And as far as I know, this is just kind of
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.160]   built into Android.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.000]   Android is actually has innovated in the area
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.120]   of being able to send data in between apps
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.440]   that the Android share menu is very customizable.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.800]   And as a developer, you can insert items
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.920]   to be able to send data easily to your app.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.640]   So I think that is core.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.880]   And I'm not sure what this means then for stock Android.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.960]   I don't know if they've dafforked it or--
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.160]   - Well Google could come up with their own e-forks
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.840]   'cause it's the only one that has to do with it right now.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.480]   - Right, but Google could decide to come up
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.800]   with its own technical workaround
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.240]   or HTC's workaround could be contributed into the source code
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.960]   and be implemented by anyone.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.920]   There's ways for it to propagate.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.640]   I don't know if they will.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.480]   - Right.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.680]   - But it's just the ongoing patent wars.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.440]   It's not gonna get any better folks.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.440]   Sorry.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.400]   - Ah, it sucks.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.240]   - None of that?
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.400]   - Yeah, go ahead, Gina.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   - I know, I just, I always go back to the,
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.880]   like when the Apple folks went to Xerox Park
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.240]   and saw the GUI and came back and said,
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.120]   "Great job," said, "Great artist steal."
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.120]   I just, I can't help it.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.080]   Listen, think of that whole story
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.880]   whenever these things come up.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.200]   You know, HTC said this is a small UI experience
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.280]   and would remove it from its own.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.240]   So maybe this is detection and sharing
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.880]   that goes a little farther than the stock Android.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.760]   So maybe this won't be an issue for the core.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:07.600]   - Yeah.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.360]   - Anyways, all right, I won't get tongue tied
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.040]   about my frustration of a patents.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.720]   - Paul David Sharroon says it doesn't affect 2.3 in later.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.520]   So that almost makes it irrelevant.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.440]   - Yeah.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.640]   Oh, good.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.880]   - Oh, all right.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.120]   I hope he's right.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.960]   - Never mind.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.760]   Last time I was on this week in Google,
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.480]   Eric Schmidt had just said that by summer,
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:30.040]   every TV you saw in stores would have Google TV on it.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.520]   He likes to predict things in six month increments,
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.320]   apparently, because this time he told an Italian newspaper,
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.320]   in the next six months, we plan to market
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.160]   a tablet of the highest quality.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.400]   Let the parsing begin.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.560]   A tablet, not tablets.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.400]   And we are going to market, we plan to market,
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.000]   not an Android tablet.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.880]   Is Google gonna come out with their own tablet?
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.880]   - A Google roller, pure Google experience,
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.600]   from page of google.com, buy it through us,
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.000]   well, maybe not buy it through us.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.120]   - I wish that Schmidt would just not talk so much
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:07.960]   into shit.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.720]   (laughing)
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.880]   I wish that we were just sort of surprised,
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.080]   like, wow, this is a serious iPad rival.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.680]   I wish the consumers were saying that.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.760]   - I kind of feel like-- - He's about to buy.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.080]   - He was talking to an Italian newspaper.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.120]   It was printed, the quote was printed in Italian,
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.920]   although he probably said it in English.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.280]   And then it was translated from the Italian back.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.640]   We could have something lost in the translation.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.400]   It's quite possible, although it's Eric Schmidt
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.320]   we're talking about, so who knows?
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.040]   But it's quite possible he was saying,
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.560]   yeah, in the next six months,
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.400]   we're gonna be marketing all these great tablets
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.880]   with ice cream sandwich that are gonna be high quality,
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.000]   and it just gets babble-fished into sounding different.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.920]   - Or Google translated, or Google voice,
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.200]   transcription, or whatever it was.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.760]   - It happens to Schmidt English to English.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.280]   You can imagine what happens to English.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   (laughing)
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.240]   - English to Italian to English.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.880]   - Does Google Translate have a Schmidt to English?
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.320]   - Oh my god, they obviously need one.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.920]   If they have Klingon, they need Schmidt to English.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.760]   (laughing)
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.880]   Schmidt to English.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.520]   We're gonna attempt to make a really good tablet soon.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.440]   Just hold on, and we'll check, and you'll see.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.320]   - That's the other side.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.720]   It's like, look, yeah, I'll have to have a crap,
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.000]   but we're gonna make a high quality one.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.440]   - We're gonna make one that's serious.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.800]   Now we're getting serious about this tablet thing.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.520]   - I do think that it's quite possible
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.560]   that Google comes out with some sort of reference tablet,
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.000]   eventually, don't you?
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:26.920]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.760]   - Yes.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.600]   - That seems possible.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.400]   - Absolutely, and hopefully we'll get one at Google I/O.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.600]   - You mean get one free.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.480]   (laughing)
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.840]   - No, actually, I don't wanna get one free.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.000]   I want the Google tablet to be so damn good
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.840]   that I can't help but go out and get it.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.680]   - You have to go right.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.760]   - And it makes me a man than my iPad.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.760]   - Yeah, I'm very curious to see ice cream sandwich tablets,
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.120]   and I really feel like in this case,
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.120]   that's what Eric Schmidt was saying,
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.880]   is we've got ice cream sandwich coming out on tablets
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.240]   in the next six months, and it's awesome.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.360]   And I hope it is, I hope it is awesome.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.680]   Are we gonna do the Google Zeitgeist?
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.200]   - Up to you, I don't know.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.440]   I was kind of,
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.680]   answering my head to I save it for next week when Leo
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.880]   and Jeff run through the top stories of the year.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.600]   - We could do that, 'cause I've also got one
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.960]   I'll put on there right now that you can save,
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:17.320]   I mean, we do next week for top stories
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:21.160]   in Google versus Twitter versus news.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.120]   Why don't we do that next week?
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.320]   - All right, you guys should do the year interview.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.160]   - The year in, yeah.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.240]   - Yeah, I'll put that on right there now.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.360]   - So we could talk about the augmented reality glasses.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.440]   - Oh, sure.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.680]   - Yeah, that's more fun.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.160]   - So those need to be discussed.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.320]   - There was a lot of wearable computing news this week.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.280]   There were rumors about Apple dipping
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:42.240]   into wearable computing, and sort of the watch stuff,
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.600]   one of the interesting things is,
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.840]   and I can't remember the guy's name,
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.680]   and I don't see it in this article,
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.160]   an expert on wearable computing was hired by Apple,
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.080]   worked for them for a while,
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.040]   but the summer moved to Google,
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:57.000]   and ReadWriteWeb has a story about possible glasses
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   that would look like normal, probably hipster-ish glasses.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   They wouldn't look like big virtual reality goggles,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.720]   like we're used to seeing from the '90s,
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.200]   but they didn't look like normal glasses,
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.000]   but have a heads-up display.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.840]   So they would augment reality while you're just walking around.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.640]   - Google goggles kind of installed
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.200]   in the inside of your glasses lenses, basically,
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.680]   kind of telling you what things are
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.840]   and bringing up the Wikipedia page, that kind of thing.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.200]   - Yeah, Nick built and wrote about it for "New York Times"
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.440]   as it's part of the Google X-Lab
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.200]   that prompted Google specialist Seth Weintraub,
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.480]   now at Fortune and formerly of Computer World
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.000]   to call the news an open secret
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.320]   among some in the Google community.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.920]   There's a lot of that kind of stuff where they're like,
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.560]   "Oh yeah, everybody at Google's been doing this.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.320]   "They've been trying it out."
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:47.000]   So we should station a reporter down in Mountain View
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.080]   to just look for people who are all wearing
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.200]   the same kind of glasses.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.320]   - Wearing hipster glasses.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.440]   - And kind of have a 10,000 yard stare when they look at you.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.280]   - Yeah.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.240]   - Stumbling around the street seeing nothing, yes.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.200]   - Yeah, if we go to Mountain View,
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.560]   looking for people wearing hipster glasses,
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.240]   we will find them, but that doesn't mean
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.320]   that these kind of glasses.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:07.240]   I love this, no, this is William Gibson, Neil Stevenson,
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.760]   Daniel Suarez's world come to life.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.680]   This is the kind of thing that makes me feel
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.800]   like we're living in the future.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.560]   The idea that I could just put on a pair of glasses,
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:19.280]   look totally normal, and walk around seeing like,
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.120]   "Oh, that's so and so, or this is the location
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.720]   "where this happened, or there's the menu for that restaurant,
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.640]   "that kind of Google goggles kind of stuff."
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.640]   - Or that, I think you're last Google+ post.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.360]   - Yeah, notifications from the person
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.760]   that's walking toward you.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.720]   - Yeah, I mean, whenever I see friends
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.800]   who I just haven't seen for a while,
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.720]   I always try to like look at their Twitter stream
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:41.640]   or their blog or whatever, their Facebook
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.720]   before we get together.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.640]   So I kind of have like, "Oh, how's your dog?"
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.200]   I saw that you, you know, whatever.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.840]   I saw you took him to the vet last week,
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.400]   kind of like that ambient intimacy
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.720]   that you get from social media.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.000]   I want that, I don't want to have to remember
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.840]   to check before I leave.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.200]   I just want to see the glasses, you know,
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.240]   kind of the latest tweet.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.240]   You know, I had tuna for lunch.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.880]   How was your sandwich?
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.720]   You know, right on my head.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.080]   - Or in my case, it would tell me
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.480]   how many times this person has insulted me on Twitter.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.680]   (laughing)
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.720]   - Oh, this is a withdrawal that said, "Have you Jeff?"
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.480]   Like 50 times, you could say it for a second.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.480]   - And I turned into a ninja and...
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.440]   (laughing)
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.600]   - And we pressed the K button for you to kick.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.440]   - That's right.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:23.240]   Last year at CES, I think somebody had ski goggles
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.280]   with Google Maps in them, right?
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.240]   So, you know, we've seen this layer,
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.280]   L-A-Y-A-R has been talking about this for a while.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.200]   So, yeah, then what'll happen is
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.640]   that the federal government will outlaw walking in them.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.000]   - Well, actually, Marshall Kirkpatrick
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.920]   and ReadRight web speculates at the very end of his article.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.720]   In a future with SOPA, they could prohibit looking
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.280]   at copyrighted materials through these glasses.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.920]   (laughing)
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:48.880]   Sorry, you don't have the rights to look
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.880]   at that television screen with those glasses on.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.200]   - Well, and in Germany, you'll walk in
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.320]   and they'll blur certain buildings as you pass by.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.880]   - That's right, they would.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.960]   'Cause they do that on Google Street too.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.240]   So, if you're using Google Street too
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.680]   and your glasses to get extra information,
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.280]   all of a sudden everything gets blurry.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.520]   You wander out on the auto bond and get right down.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.520]   - But, that building is not in your rights.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.080]   (laughing)
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.960]   - The building does not exist.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.280]   - I had to take off my glasses so I could see.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.120]   - Yeah.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.640]   (laughing)
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.640]   - All right, Facebook, Google, Apple and Rackspace
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.360]   rated best places to work among the best places to work.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.200]   - Well, the latter comes just from Scoble voting a lot.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.560]   (laughing)
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.360]   - Oh, come on, they deduced him, right?
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.200]   Right?
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.040]   - That was, yeah.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.200]   - That's speaking Scoble.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.920]   - Exactly, Glassdoor does this.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.520]   This is an annual thing for them.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.800]   This is their fourth annual,
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.080]   Employees Choice Awards.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.520]   When I worked at CNET, actually they would let folks know
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.400]   that it was going on.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.320]   It wasn't quite a campaign,
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.160]   but they'd send out a company wide email like,
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.920]   "Hey, Glassdoor's taking the voting on best places to work.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.840]   "You might wanna go."
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.840]   - Speaking of which guys, you all wanna vote for us,
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.080]   of course, in twignominated on tv.com.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.520]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.960]   - Speaking of cheating on polls.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:00.880]   - Speaking of voting.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.440]   - Speaking of campaigning.
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.600]   - Great army, do your thing, go.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.240]   - Yeah, just the tech sector, 2012,
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.840]   best places to work in technology in this order.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:15.120]   Facebook, MITRE, been around for a long time.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.240]   Heavy duty back end stuff.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.160]   Google, Apple, and Rackspace.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.000]   Facebook actually slipped from the top spot to number three
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.520]   on the 2012 list, and Google has moved up to the fifth slot
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.720]   from number 30 on last year's list.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.440]   - Oh, Larry, Larry, Larry.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.840]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.720]   - And then there's the CEO approval rating.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.080]   Everybody fell.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:36.920]   (laughs)
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.560]   - Oh, nevermind.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.160]   - Mark Zuckerberg slipped to 89% from 96%.
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.600]   I think that's the economy, right?
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.040]   - It is the economy.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:45.960]   - I mean, not just Zuckerberg,
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.880]   but pretty much everybody.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.840]   Tim Cook had a 96% approval,
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.560]   just one point below Steve Jobs' approval rating
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.880]   last year of 97%, so that's not too bad.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:01.200]   Eric Schmitz, 96% at the end of last year,
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.200]   compared to Larry Page having a 92%, so a little lower.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:10.520]   These things can easily be wrong.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.040]   This isn't the scientific poll, is it?
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:18.120]   - Yeah, and Cook, let's see how he does next year.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.400]   I think right now it's like support.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:24.960]   Tim, at Apple, I wanna see what his approval rating is next year.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.000]   New Facebook apps out and ReadRightWeb,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.400]   amongst many others reporting that updated.com
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.880]   revealed daily average use on Facebook for Android,
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.600]   surpassed Facebook for iPhone.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:42.240]   Android Facebook app now has 58.8 million daily average users
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:47.040]   while Facebook for iPhone has only 57.6 million daily average users.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.240]   Why is that?
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.440]   Is the Facebook app on Android just that much better?
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.760]   - Yeah, this is fascinating.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.200]   Let's know what Twitter's numbers are.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.240]   Like, is this about Facebook or is it about Android?
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.920]   - It's gonna be about the install base.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.240]   Yeah, it's the install base.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:04.040]   700,000 a day, that's what's happening.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.400]   - Well, yeah, is it just bulk?
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.240]   - It's bulk.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.400]   - Yeah. - Right.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.960]   - More Android phones out there,
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.240]   so more people using Facebook.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.080]   Makes sense.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.120]   All right, let's take a quick break
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.600]   and thank our other sponsor for this week
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.880]   in Google Netflix, streamed thousands of TV episodes
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.880]   and movies directly to you instantly on all kinds of devices.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.680]   If you've got a television that's internet connected,
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.760]   you probably have it as an app right there on the television.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.320]   It's also available in all the major game consoles,
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.920]   Xbox 360, Wii, PS3.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.360]   In fact, I read a stat the other day
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:41.920]   that the Wii has the most video streaming of all three consoles.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.600]   People using it as, watch television.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.720]   Get it on the Google TV, I was watching,
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.560]   well, Eileen was watching Gossip Girl over Netflix on Google.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.200]   - Admitted, that's when watching that show.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.040]   - All kinds of ways to watch all the TV episodes
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.000]   and movies you want directly to you
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.520]   on your mobile to phone tablet, all those ways.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.320]   And you can get it for free for 30 days,
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:08.320]   netflix.com/twit, the perfect cheap out holiday present
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.960]   when you've forgotten, you're at that holiday party.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.480]   Someone has gotten you a gift certificate to Red Lobster
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:14.720]   and you don't know what to do,
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.120]   write down netflix.com/twit, 30 days free,
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.560]   hand it to 'em, you're in the clear.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:24.800]   'Cause it works for anybody, doesn't matter.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.160]   30 days free unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.040]   and we thank netflix for their support
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.240]   of this week in Google.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:35.320]   - Kindle Fire, fastest growing tablet
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.360]   since the original iPad.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.320]   Doesn't shock me, is it surprising to anybody?
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.520]   - Does it surprise me at all?
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.360]   - No.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.760]   - I'm seeing lots of friends and families
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.560]   weekend, everyone's gotten a Kindle of some sort,
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.960]   but the fire, a lot of people--
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:47.800]   - Really?
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.520]   - And fire, yep, yep.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:53.160]   I think it's like, iPad opened up this market of
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.960]   this small handheld touchscreen computer
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.960]   and the fire is affordable and there's an update out
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:00.680]   already apparently.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.520]   - Yeah, there's a--
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.200]   - Pissing the lightiness on it, yeah.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.920]   - Yeah, update out today, it does all those things,
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.560]   it allows you to delete embarrassing things
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.880]   from the carousel too.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.600]   - Ah, does it?
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.440]   - So you can safely visit--
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:13.840]   - Like a scroll or--
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.680]   - The Gossip Girl website.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.040]   No one need ever know.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:18.840]   (laughing)
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.720]   Also added features to the Kindle iOS app
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:26.040]   that, you know, on the other tablet,
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:28.080]   so you can access all the magazines and newspapers
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.400]   that you can on the Kindle Fire on iOS.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.560]   I think that's interesting that Amazon has created
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:37.400]   this very nimble strategy of competing with itself,
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.880]   which I think ends up getting you more people in the end.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.920]   'Cause you can't say like, oh well, you know,
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:46.360]   that Kindle app on the Fire is much better than the iPad.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.640]   It's like use the Kindle, buy our stuff.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:53.000]   And that's really, the point is that they are making
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.200]   handover fist, we talked about this on Tech News today,
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.640]   yesterday, they're making a lot of money off of the Kindle Fire,
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.200]   off of all the Kindle's actually,
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.560]   all the versions of it, more money than ever.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:08.280]   - It's a very efficient buying machine, for sure.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.120]   - Yeah.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.120]   - That they've done great, I think it's great.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.440]   - Is it good for Android, bad for Android,
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:19.560]   or neutral for Android?
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:20.680]   - I've never figured that one out.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.600]   - Since it's still modified, that's the question, huh?
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.440]   - Yeah, we've talked about this a few times,
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.720]   and at first I thought that it was good for Android,
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.000]   'cause hey, it's an open source project,
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.640]   and it's great because this means that Amazon
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.880]   is working on the Android code,
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.400]   and more people are gonna know Android
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.400]   and have experience with Android,
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.760]   but I think that it's kind of to the point
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.920]   where I just think it's neutral.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.080]   I think that the fact that it's Android
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.280]   is a complete non-issue for Amazon.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:46.600]   And sort of, I mean, I guess Google's happy
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.920]   that Amazon's getting it out there,
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.960]   but I don't think that it's really goes either way.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.240]   I think for Amazon, this is just like,
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:57.240]   this is an easy way to deliver a color touchscreen experience
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.760]   on the Kindle, but we're just gonna make this
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.640]   a really good buying machine.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.880]   I don't think that Android really had much to do with it.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.280]   I think it's kind of neutral.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.960]   - Yeah, that's the way I feel right now, too, Gina.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:07.800]   It's neutral.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.320]   It doesn't hurt Android in any way,
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.120]   but it sort of doesn't really give it a help,
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.280]   'cause I think people think of it as Kindle.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:15.960]   It's a Kindle, right?
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:19.840]   There's not a lot that's recognizable as Android on it,
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.200]   and it's an older version of Android.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:26.880]   And I had this kind of, I'm an open source hippie, right?
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.040]   So I had this vision that Amazon and Google
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.920]   were gonna start working on the Android code together
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.960]   that'd be the Amazon be submitting patches.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.880]   And theory, that can certainly happen, right?
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:38.200]   I don't know that it has, and I don't know if it will,
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.720]   I hope so, but that's cool either way.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.560]   - I think it's great that you have to, you know,
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:45.880]   companies with the resources that they have
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.440]   with engineers working on Android.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.000]   I do think that that makes it stronger,
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.160]   but for the most part, I think it's just neutral
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.480]   because it's such a different version,
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.840]   because it's been totally Amazonified.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:58.000]   - But one thing is, there was a report
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.980]   out of Canada this last week that Amazon was
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:04.320]   issued by in RIM, and basically that now puts RIM
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.320]   on the market finally,
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.240]   'cause the value's gone down to nothing.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.080]   And that becomes interesting,
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:11.080]   does Amazon have its own phones?
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:15.880]   And if Google owns Motorola, does Amazon own RIM,
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:17.880]   and then does Amazon change OS's?
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.600]   It's a bit sad?
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.720]   RIM supposedly turned down the offer,
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.880]   but this is just the start of a process.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:27.160]   - Yeah, apparently RIM turned out a lot offers.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:29.040]   And Microsoft was also nosing around,
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.880]   and they said, "No, we don't want to sell."
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:34.680]   At least the co-CEOs, Liza Reedus and Balsley,
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:36.520]   said, "No, we don't want to sell."
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.960]   Amazon kind of has a soft spot for RIM.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.640]   I think maybe Bezos looks at it and says,
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.440]   "Please, please let me buy you."
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.680]   I like blackberries, I want to save blackberries.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:49.840]   I designed the first Kindle to look like a blackberry.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.320]   And yeah, they actually did.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.920]   Which is one of the reasons it looks so weird, I think.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.240]   (both laughing)
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:04.120]   But yeah, the Kindle is doing exactly what Amazon wanted.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.760]   It's making money off of sales.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.640]   It's making money off of selling you things,
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.360]   getting you to buy things from Amazon
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.600]   through all the different stores that they offer on there.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.920]   And I think it's a huge success in a way
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.200]   that doesn't impact, not only Android,
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.720]   but I don't think it impacts any other tablets, really.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.960]   I know it counts as a tablet,
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:24.960]   and so it's taking share from the iPad in that way.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.360]   But I think there are two different things.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.880]   I'm on that side of the argument.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.160]   I don't think it's wrong to compare the fire in the iPad,
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.240]   but I think what Apple's doing is saying,
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.080]   we want to sell a device.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.760]   So we put some content out there to get you to buy the device.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.080]   And it's an expensive device, not horribly expensive,
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.280]   but it's a high-end device.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.280]   It's an appliance and it's meant to do a lot of things.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.280]   And hopefully we can convince you it's good for productivity,
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.360]   and we can sell some to hospitals and schools
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.040]   and pilots can use it in the cockpit.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.760]   Amazon's saying that's not what we want to do.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.360]   We want to make a very inexpensive device
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.840]   that gets you to consume media
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.920]   and buy MP3s and videos and books
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:06.400]   and even physical objects from us through our store.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.400]   Yep.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.280]   I think you're absolutely right.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.520]   Are we offended that they seem to be redirecting any request
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:17.360]   for the Android marketplace to the Amazon store,
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.840]   the Amazon Android store?
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.760]   I think the more choice for consumers is better,
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.760]   but it's their device.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.760]   But if I just want to look,
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.040]   if I want to go on the web and look at the Android marketplace
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.200]   and just kind of browse around and see
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.560]   what would be available there, it takes it.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.400]   It's slightly obnoxious.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.960]   It redirects, you're right.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.320]   It is obnoxious.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.320]   That is kind of obnoxious.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.880]   I get why the App Store would work,
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.560]   like an App Store link would work that way.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.080]   That's usability.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.640]   There's got to be a way to let me browse around, though.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.640]   Of course, I put get jar.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.200]   That was the first thing I did when I got my fire.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.320]   I put get jar on it.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.200]   If it gets jar on it, yeah.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.560]   Makes sense.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.560]   So that--
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.480]   There's nothing that would be confusing about letting a user
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.080]   look through the Android market on the web browser.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:03.200]   If they clicked install, their Kindle wouldn't show up
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.480]   in the list of compatible devices,
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.680]   even if they were signed into Google.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.200]   I think it would be pretty clear.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.880]   So I didn't realize, actually, that they were doing that.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.920]   The redirecting just web links to the market.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.200]   So that's slightly obnoxious.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.840]   But it is their device and they're getting--
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.600]   they're very involved in all the web browsing that happens
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.080]   on the fire on that as a feature.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.600]   I mean, the silk browser.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.240]   So I think that's part--
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.440]   I think when you buy the Kindle,
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.400]   you're buying the Amazon experience
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.080]   and the privilege of buying Amazon products
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.280]   very easily and cheaply.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.640]   Apparently, the new update fixes this.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.360]   I have yet to get the update and check it out.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.760]   So I hope it is fixed.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.400]   I can't imagine Amazon would really want to be that annoying.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.080]   FTC senators Herb Cole and Mike Lee
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.960]   have written to Google--
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.280]   or actually, no, not to Google.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:57.240]   They've written about Google to the Federal Trade Commission
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.560]   about Google's market dominance.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.320]   They want the FTC to investigate whether Google is
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.600]   abusing their position in the marketplace
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.600]   to steer users to its own web products.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.040]   I put this in here just mainly for one little reason,
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.280]   which was to sigh.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.040]   We went through this before--
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.160]   We're still going through it in Europe, right?
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.200]   They're just being idiots.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.360]   When this issue was first raised,
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.040]   I think it was either the Texas case
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.160]   or maybe one of the European cases.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.520]   I absolutely rolled my eyes and said,
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.000]   look, Google's a website and you don't have to use it for search.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.640]   So they can direct you to anything they want legally.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.280]   However, there is an argument to be made
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.920]   that search has become so important to using the web
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.600]   that it may be some sort of quasi-common carrier.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.200]   And if that's the case, could they
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.880]   be found to be abusing their market share?
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.000]   But they don't have the market share here
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.160]   that they have in Germany, for example.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.120]   Market share here is 60% percent, Germany is 90% percent.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.520]   There's plenty of other competitors.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.400]   And by that same token, The New York Times
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.440]   has a large market share for national newspapers
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.080]   and it promotes its own stuff.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.520]   So--
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.280]   Gotcha.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.720]   Good morning America promotes ABC shows, really?
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:22.080]   I know.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:22.280]   I know.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:22.280]   I know.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:22.280]   I know.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:22.280]   I know.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.920]   Shocking.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.000]   And honestly, I don't think Google is--
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.200]   I don't know this for sure.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.920]   But I don't think Google is purposely
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:34.480]   redirecting searches to other things.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.200]   For instance, when you search on search--
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.960]   this is my favorite example--
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.960]   the top search result is Bing.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.240]   Now, if--
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.800]   I mean, no one would blink an eye if the top search result
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.720]   in Google for search was Google.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.520]   But somehow, they're not even at the top.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.560]   It's Bing, then Dogpile, then Yahoo, then Meta Search.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.640]   The top pile.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.320]   Then Google Insights.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.520]   I don't see Altavista.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.360]   But--
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.480]   That's a great example.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.080]   But yeah, I mean, and granted, they could be saying, oh, well,
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:06.880]   that's too obvious.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.880]   So let's get ourselves out of there.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:09.600]   And maybe they are.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.280]   Maybe they're saying, well, if you're in Google looking
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.280]   for search, then you're obviously not looking for Google
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.120]   because you're there.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.080]   That makes more sense to me.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.600]   I think search could be considered a utility to some extent,
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:22.800]   though.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.600]   I think that's very dangerous.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.800]   I think it's starting to become--
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.640]   And I think it's less--
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.480]   Well, I said I disagree.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.000]   I think it's also becoming less and less a force.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.080]   And what becomes more and more a force is social.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.760]   And who searches is yesterday's war?
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.320]   But I think it's always going to have utility.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.280]   This idea that we've been saying for years,
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.680]   well, this is going to replace search.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.880]   Facebook's going to replace Google, or Siri's
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.960]   going to replace Google.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.640]   I think those all take a bite out of what we use search for.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.600]   But I think there's always a core to what we need search for.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.240]   That will mean a search engine always has to be.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.880]   I don't think it's abused it in any way.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.920]   And I think that this is just a couple of senators'
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.440]   grandstandings, so.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:05.840]   I agree with that.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.480]   I really don't see any examples of them
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.600]   abusing their position.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:16.120]   And like you say, 60%, it's dominant, but it's not massive.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.240]   I mean, if you're going to do that,
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.680]   then you need to sue Apple for any trust for dominating
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.600]   the iPad market, which has been proposed.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.680]   I don't think it hasn't.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.200]   All right.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.080]   We kind of touched on why Amazon would be interested in buying
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:29.280]   rent.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.320]   Yeah, I think we're--
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.040]   So we can kind of skip past that, although I don't think
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:34.840]   Rims going to sell.
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.520]   I said that before.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.800]   And can't we hear what Jesus' tip is now?
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.800]   Yes.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.280]   Do you want to talk about the tax cut?
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.760]   Or should we go into the tips?
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.040]   Oh, that was just a minor note that just said that Obama
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.320]   took to his bringing the tax cut fight to both Twitter
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.760]   and Facebook and started a--
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.840]   I think a fair--
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.640]   it's $40.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.120]   What does $40 mean to you in a $40 hashtag?
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.480]   So some smart social person in there
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.880]   is using these for political ends.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.960]   This is certainly not going to be the first campaign
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.800]   to be fought on social networks.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:12.960]   But I think it's going to be the most fought,
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.920]   if that makes any sense.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   I mean, it's just--
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.480]   Especially when it gets down to two, yeah.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.040]   Yeah, it's a given that they're going to be doing this.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:20.560]   Absolutely.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.200]   They're really smart social media people.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.760]   And I think that they know that if they ask a question like that--
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.600]   and we're tracking all the responses to those questions
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.680]   that they pose--
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.720]   if you ask a really direct, simple question like that,
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.760]   you get some great, great responses and amusing
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.920]   think up with the White House to capture those responses.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.920]   So I mean, yeah, they're only going
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.320]   to get better at social media, especially now
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.080]   that the campaign's going to heat up next year.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.520]   Now they need voice response.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.200]   That's the new trend.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.040]   Yes.
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.880]   I just speak to a campaign and it gives me answers.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.160]   All right, Gina, let's go to your tip.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.800]   What do you got for us?
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.560]   All right, so I was going to do a completely fluffy tip.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.720]   I'll do two tips.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.840]   One is actually helpful and pretty much good.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.800]   It's Christmas time.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.080]   Of course, give us lots of tips.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.240]   I'm going to do a fluffy tip too.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:58.960]   I just changed my mind.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:07:59.720]   So do a fluffy tip.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.800]   I'm going to do a fluffy tool.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.400]   So yeah, doing.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.400]   Well, I'll do something somewhat useful.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.320]   If you use Google Voice and you're on iOS,
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.320]   the Google Voice app for iOS, just
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.800]   got an update that supports multi-recipient texting, which
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.240]   I'm sure that you're going to be wanting to do over the holidays
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.400]   when organizing get togethers.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.080]   So it sounds like a little minor thing,
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.640]   but I remember when the Android app got that,
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.400]   I was like, oh god, finally.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.080]   I can send a text to multiple people.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.320]   So that's the actual useful tip.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:29.160]   The fluffy tip is this holiday season,
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:33.040]   when you get your new phone, your fire, your new tablet,
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.800]   and one of your family members who
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.680]   doesn't spend as much time on the web as you do,
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.680]   is like, OK, show me something good.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.520]   Go to youtube.com/rewind.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.720]   And I'm sorry, Jeff and Leo.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.600]   I'm stealing one of your best of the year stories.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.680]   Top 10 most watched videos on YouTube,
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.320]   all absolute gold.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.960]   Number 10, actually, is my favorite.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:58.120]   It's a mama kitten hugging her little kitten.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.640]   It's amazing.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.400]   It's just amazing.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.600]   There's a little kitten.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.600]   It's YouTube.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.960]   A little kitten is sleeping, and the mama is sleeping.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.280]   Little kitten starts to have some bad dreams
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.760]   and shake her little paws.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.240]   And it's absolutely adorable.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.360]   And then the mama kitten just gives her a big hug.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.360]   And you're just like, your grandmother, your grandfather,
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.120]   your aunt's uncles, they will all melt.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.800]   They will just be like, this is amazing.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.960]   The web is the best thing ever.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.720]   So top 10 most watched videos.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.320]   And we have the video up now.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:28.320]   Look, so the kitten's having a little bit of a--
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.640]   she's dreaming, you know?
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.720]   And then the mama kitten reaches out and pulls her in.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.360]   Look.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.920]   That is the cutest thing.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.720]   Wow, is that not the cutest thing ever?
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.840]   I don't like cats, and that's cute.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.880]   Of course, you're going to find Rebecca Black Friday.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.120]   And the kind of typical-- a lot of videos
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.160]   you've probably seen already.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.800]   But there's some really good gold in there.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.400]   So show your relatives the top 10 videos in YouTube of the year.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:55.000]   And they'll be completely blown away about all the good stuff
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.080]   on the internet.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.000]   Let's be clear, folks.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   The tip is not that there are cat videos on YouTube.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.200]   The tip is to use the cat videos and the other top 10
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.200]   videos to entertain the family, right?
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.800]   To entertain the family and to get them
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.400]   enjoying using their new devices, which will play YouTube on them.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   I think it's a great tip.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:13.920]   It was a stretch.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:14.920]   It's going to get material.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.320]   Videos somehow.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.400]   How do you get that in there?
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.280]   All right, Jeff Jarvis, what is your number, sir?
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.280]   $2 million.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.440]   $2 million is the find that the Federal Trade Commission is
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.680]   just levied against Santa Claus.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.520]   For violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act,
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.040]   for collecting their consumer preferences for toys,
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.000]   for giving that information to third parties
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.920]   without permission, for maintaining
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.360]   a database of naughtiness and niceness,
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.880]   for tying this data to personally identifiable information,
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.760]   including the name, address, and age,
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.760]   for making visits allegedly in the dead of night to these homes.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.520]   And he's done it on an unprecedented scale,
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.240]   and it's time for it to stop.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:52.840]   I agree.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.720]   I can get that.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.920]   Where do we sign the petition?
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.760]   Go get Santa.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.760]   Just support this.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.560]   I'll tell you who's been naughty this year.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.360]   The FTC knows that's hilarious.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.200]   That's on Buzz Machine, that got.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:07.920]   I just wrote that.
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:08.720]   You just wrote that up.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.560]   That's fantastic.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.400]   Well, Cabernet, you can thank the Cabernet.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.320]   Or blame it.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.720]   Well, now this is a tool you can use to help fight this menace.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.320]   You want to know where this guy is.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.640]   If he's coming anywhere near your house,
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.840]   go to noradsanter.org.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.200]   This is my tool.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.040]   This really is this weekend fluff, yes.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.680]   And you can track him.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.480]   There's even-- well, just tie it into Twig.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.440]   There's even a Google Earth layer
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:35.040]   that you can install on Google Earth
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.840]   that will track in real time.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.280]   That sounds too legitimate, Tom.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:41.320]   Not fluffy enough.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   There's a Google Maps.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.080]   There's a Google Earth layer.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.560]   There's a Google Maps for mobile app
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.240]   that you can install.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.880]   Norad's been doing this since the '50s.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:50.600]   You know, this started.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.400]   I covered this on Tech History Today.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.200]   This started because Norad's number
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.240]   was accidentally published in a newspaper in Colorado--
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.080]   I think it was Colorado--
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.600]   as the phone number to call and leave a message for Santa.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.920]   And so the kernel in charge of Norad
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.320]   was before it was called Norad.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.600]   But the kernel in charge at the time
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.320]   said, well, let's start giving them
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.960]   positioning information.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.640]   That's what we do.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.160]   And that's how it was born.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:15.800]   That's great.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.200]   It's a tradition.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.680]   It's a holiday tradition, Norad.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.280]   Well, and plus with this new FDC investigation,
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.200]   you're important to know where the hell this guy is.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.440]   Sorry.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.920]   All of Germany has blurred out.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:33.640]   Germany's investigating his use of street view.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.760]   Google's Santa View.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.280]   Also, last Friday, the Ho-Ho hotline from Santa
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:43.480]   teamed up with Gmail to send personalized holiday phone
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.800]   calls to anyone you know who has been nice or naughty
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.320]   in the US and Canada.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:55.000]   So if you get the message at his Google voice number 85534
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.960]   Santa, you can try that out.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.280]   Go to send a call from Santa.com.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.960]   And you can have Santa call anybody you want.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.000]   This is an actual tool.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   I mean, this is a fun thing.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.880]   By the way, people don't have a call me.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.400]   It's going to take me immensely.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.400]   It's spam.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.800]   It's going to just get me very screwy.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.600]   OK?
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:15.960]   Listen to it.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.320]   Welcome to the North Pole.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.840]   I don't want that.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:22.880]   Happy holidays, folks.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.000]   It's a investigate.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.280]   We've got the Festivus Pole set up right here.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.720]   OK, well, should we go out on the frog video?
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.880]   We'll go out on the frog video.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.640]   We'll go out on the background.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.280]   This is a follow up to last week's lizard eating
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.320]   Android screen ants video.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.840]   All right.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:44.440]   Leo LePort--
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.600]   It's 47 seconds long.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:49.480]   Leo LePort will be back next week for the year end wrap up
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.240]   this week in Google.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.520]   Don't miss it.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.800]   Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.600]   Every tree should have a copy of public parts
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.080]   underneath it this holiday season.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.280]   You're worried about the third night of Hanukkah?
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.080]   There you go.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:02.680]   There you go.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:06.920]   Every menorah, every tree, every Festivus pole.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.160]   Get one, put it under there.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:13.520]   And then while you sit back and sip your cocoa and your egg
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.920]   nog and look at the fireplace over the holidays,
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.680]   go to smartawear.org and sign up for ThinkUp.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.000]   Yeah, get ThinkUp, archive your tweets and your posts.

[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:24.920]   Exactly.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.040]   I actually won't be here next week for the end of,
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.960]   so I will see everyone in the new year.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.520]   Oh, OK.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.000]   Well, I won't be here either.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   So I won't be here either.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.880]   I'm in solidarity with you.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.960]   OK.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.800]   Me and Tom, we won't be here, but we still love you.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.320]   Exactly.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:38.800]   We can sign out.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.040]   Absolutely.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.680]   And Tom tribute.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.360]   Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.560]   This week in Google, Glee, Chipotle.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.400]   We'll see you next time.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:50.480]   If I could get this going.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:58.640]   OK, that's good.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.240]   You got to watch till the end.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:09.200]   I like that he's really reached for it, really jumping for it.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:09.720]   Oh, there he goes.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.520]   Yeah, is that good?
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.520]   Ouch.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:19.560]   Be sad of him.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.480]   Wow.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.880]   He's like, I'm tired of not getting any flies or any ants.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:27.680]   And I need-- I write.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.320]   I need to feel-- I need to get something.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.320]   I know.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.280]   I need to bite us up.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.320]   They're good.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:44.200]   (upbeat music)
