[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.140]   Tech after Row. We also talk about
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:18.560]   the creepy idea of dead people talking to you from your madamay and then we get to my favorite story
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.480]   Guess what? Taco Bell has a tostada built on a giant
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.800]   Cheez-it. All that is coming up next

[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.200]   I'm Jeff Jarvis. I apologize for that all the time
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.080]   But you're with us and it's gonna be a good time because I am here
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.200]   While Leo is off doing whatever Leo is doing
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.560]   I'm quite confused at what he's doing, but we'll get to that later with
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.920]   Stacey Higginbotham the queen of IOT. Hi Stacey
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.200]   Hello Jeff, so glad to be here
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.080]   And I'm glad you're here too
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.880]   As opposed to some weeks when you just disappear on us, but you have good excuses next week you're going to Paris
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.200]   But I'm glad you're here for my week this week. I'm very very happy and there is Aunt Pruitt the
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.320]   Counselor for all of
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.400]   Twitt the guy who keeps all of our club members happy and respects them and loves them and they him and we're glad you're here
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   Hello, and hello mr. Jarvis how you be and you succeed and I'm driving them crazy because we're actually doing this
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.640]   After the show, but I'm doing it before the show because I messed up before so that's the fun of this if you were a member of the club
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.200]   I'll bet you get to see all the ways I screw up
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.880]   So now let's get into our news this week. We are going to be democratic
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.080]   This is not like the normal show because Leo is not here and we're going to use democracy because Leo keeps saying it's not a democracy
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.680]   Well this week Leo it is and so I'm asking my co-host to mark the stories they want to do and
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.240]   Stacey's gonna pick the first one
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.440]   Well, let's let's kick it off with I think our big story this week Jeff
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.080]   I I'm just gonna actually I'm gonna say it's the big story this week. It is I think in the wake of
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.640]   the
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.400]   The this is the job's decision that makes Roe versus Wade
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.920]   obsolete
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.400]   you called this when the when the Stacy when the
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.920]   decision was leaked and
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.360]   You called the angles here and I thought about it going in today's show and I thought you know
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.720]   There's this thing about newspapers have the local angle right, you know
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.520]   America lands on moon local company makes screws and rockets right and I don't want to go so far as to find tech angles to everything
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.040]   But this story was not hard to find a lot of stories. This has many many tech angles
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.160]   But what the companies are doing about what they're saying about privacy about technology
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.360]   Encryption all kinds of things so Stacy
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.800]   Where do you want to start? I?
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.960]   Want to start first by like I?
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.160]   Guess it's not explaining. This is stuff
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.080]   We all know but I think it's really important to reiterate in the wake of this decision
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:18.360]   So the big macro story that everyone's talking about we're like holy cow some states are going to outlaw abortion and as part of that
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.280]   When a woman is pregnant?
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.960]   They the data that they might look for an abortion and they're going to both have data
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.000]   collected by many companies not just tech companies but many companies they collect data and they're very interested in knowing if
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.440]   Someone's pregnant and they're interested in knowing that because
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:46.120]   Being pregnant means you're about to spend a heck of a lot of money, right? Like yeah all kinds of stuff
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.320]   So this is not nefarious like tech companies are like oh my gosh you're pregnant because I want to get all in your business
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.600]   They're like oh my gosh you're pregnant and you're gonna spend a ton of money and advertisers really want to part piece of that
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.920]   and so
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.040]   They have a vested interest in keeping this data collecting this data and reselling this data and they always have
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.760]   And it's it's retailers. It's your grocery store your phone. So we're seeing a lot of stories about like
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.640]   delete your period trackers
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.320]   Or you know turn off your phone if you're going to go get an abortion
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.960]   I it's a lot
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.960]   It's a lot broader than that. It's
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.800]   The whole world wants to know when you're pregnant and they have access to that data and can infer from that
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:36.120]   So then the question becomes what do states do to if you're going to prosecute someone for going over state lines for an abortion
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.160]   Or maybe you just miscarry maybe didn't even realize you were pregnant
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160]   And if they want to prosecute that they could and so
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.240]   That's and they can ask tech companies or financial services firms or target for
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.360]   For this data and use that in a prosecution is kind of the worries
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.880]   And the big focus is on things like location data
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.200]   Period trackers
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.160]   I would argue things like, you know, I've got a Fitbit on
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.000]   When that
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.160]   When someone's pregnant you might get an elevated heart rate for which you can infer that someone's pregnant
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.080]   So there's a lot of data already being gathered that can infer someone is pregnant
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.560]   So that's kind of the big picture story
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.000]   And we can talk about individual things tech companies are and aren't doing or could and couldn't do so
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.720]   I'll stop talking
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:30.920]   When you say it's it's it's bigger than the abortion you're basically saying because there's other things that can be construed from
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.080]   Construed from the amount of data that's available. Is that what you're saying?
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.640]   Well, I'm saying it's bigger than the abortion issue because there's so there's so much of a financial interest
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.040]   on behalf of
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.600]   Everyone if someone is pregnant. They're like
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.080]   There are about four or five stages of life when you're about to spend a lot of money
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.800]   Pregnancy as one moving into a new home is another getting married is usually one. Yeah, so
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.680]   Those companies are not going to stop collecting that data. I know people are like they should stop collecting this data
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.920]   They're not going to stop trying to make these inferences because it's too lucrative
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.040]   Even if it's not privacy stacy if it's just if it's just location data and you went to you know
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.120]   You went out of state
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.760]   And and weeks after having announced you were pregnant or or other things there's gonna be a lot that goes on
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.280]   I'm interested in two angles on this
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:31.400]   First what consumers should smartly do what women should do, but first what what should we expect the companies to do
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.120]   For the users. They're also doing things for their employees and I think we'll get to that in a few minutes
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.760]   But for the users a highly responsible tech company should now do what?
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:47.800]   This is tough because legally they're obligated to share this data
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.800]   And when you agree to the terms and services even if you don't read them, they're like, hey
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.760]   If I've got a subpoena and if your state issues if you're if your state
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.960]   DA or who are prosecutor issues the subpoena for that data they have to give it up
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.840]   so so what data should should they should there be certain data that they
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.080]   give you a
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.680]   ability to erase or that they should erase on a regular schedule or
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.240]   I think asking the tech companies to do anything here is
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.240]   It's silly
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.440]   It's it's how we're trained to think as Americans because we tend to think the answer lies with private enterprise
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.880]   But the answer actually unfortunately lies with high quality regulation
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.640]   You could do it either by making a federal law to make abortion legal
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:38.680]   That solves this particular issue or you could do a federal privacy law that prevents and lays out parameters
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.520]   They could address the disparity in the state's
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.240]   Laws here about when and how they can when and what and how they can give up data
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.680]   When they get data what data they give up and how
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.400]   But but we have a
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.200]   Non-functioning democracy in many ways
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.480]   These things that should be done. I agree at a federal level aren't going to get done either on privacy or on abortion
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.880]   And so if you are an executive of a tech company saying hmm
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.480]   What's what can I do? What should I do? Is there any guidance at all for them?
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.480]   I
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.400]   Think they're trying to do what they can they're in a really crappy position in the sense like they're they're saying things like hey
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.800]   We will fund your abortion
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:31.160]   Uh, we will fund travel out of the state so you can go get one and I mean that's a nice but what makes that a correct position for them
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:37.320]   What what makes that a crappy position for the tech companies because
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.000]   I
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.160]   Want to say I heard it from you and I totally agreed at the time when you were saying or someone said that these tech companies are putting all of these
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:55.320]   Different advertisements and post up about being for the cause and you know, we support yada yada yada
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.800]   Um, but yet at the same time and all that was was just that post
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.760]   They didn't put their money where their mouth is if you know what I mean
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.160]   And here is an instance where they are actually putting their money where their mouth is
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.320]   So what makes it if you know, what'd you say?
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.720]   This is a prosecutor or the law enforcement off
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:19.160]   Yeah, if the law enforcement officers go to your company's HR and they say hey, we want these records
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.200]   Mm-hmm. If you're state if you're if your company there there's a couple issues one
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:30.040]   I'm not sure that they would feel comfortable and even legally protected if they refused to give
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.320]   That information away, but two
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.680]   It requires you to have a job to be
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:43.560]   Able to get access to what is really health care and we already have that system here. So that's not super unusual
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.960]   but think about
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.840]   like
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.760]   Think about a teenager who wants to get an abortion? Yeah, they can't
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.920]   right
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.920]   so
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.560]   What about from the user consumer perspective
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.760]   What if you lived in?
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.360]   If you lived in and pick a state, um, who was the first one Missouri? Texas
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.600]   Texas
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.080]   Yep. Well, yeah, yeah, you know Texas
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.840]   Um
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.480]   What different digital hygiene would you take on if you were thinking of getting pregnant?
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:31.800]   I don't think I think the things people are suggesting are helpful. I don't think they can cover everything
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.720]   Nope
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   And I and I say that because
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.880]   Like I don't know if y'all remember probably this was one of the first big data stories
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.640]   It came in on like 2013 or something and it was target realizing some kid was pregnant before they did it
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.760]   And send a notice to the a mailer to the house in the day. It was very big hoo-ha
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:58.280]   It's not just tech companies that know this
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.440]   And and so like
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.560]   I don't think you can actually
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.120]   Protect yourself. You could you could pay cash for everything
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:19.080]   You could only surf the internet through you know tour. You could do everything as encrypted as possible. You know, could not have a phone perhaps
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.560]   Yeah, you could not have a phone
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:31.480]   Without how do you work smart days without without how do you how do you don't call your doctor? How do you stay in touch with your family?
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:39.800]   It doesn't have a landline smartphone get a get a feature phone. It's that's you know, it doesn't have all of the smarts and connectivity
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.600]   Well, you would have to have it not have GPS
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.560]   Ah, yeah, there's that too
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.680]   Well, they could still subpoena the the cell phone records, right? The tower
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.760]   They could actually they could say you would just have to revert back to a landline
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:00.360]   And an answer they can and they can subpoena your what what numbers you called
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   Yeah
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.880]   Yes, but you probably I mean I guess you could get a burner phone
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.640]   And use it not in if you were going to use a burner phone
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.280]   You would never want to use it from your house. You would want to make sure you're into I mean like I'm not a spy
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.600]   I'm not trained in
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.760]   Sure, nor should we have
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:25.240]   Family that's that's what a spy is supposed to say mr. Jory's
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.840]   This is my cover
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.680]   I think I think Stacy's outfit today does look rather like
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:40.760]   European dashing spy doesn't it my joncy airline price to save the world. Yeah
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:46.760]   And I am going to Paris next week. So well you are see here. Oh my
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.880]   Oh my
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.280]   So I mean I want to tell people
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.680]   I just feel like
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:01.640]   We have to understand the scope of the problem and the scope of the problem is everybody has a vested interest in knowing if you're pregnant in this society
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:07.560]   So and there are no legal protections for companies that are like, oh crap. I don't want to give this data up
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:13.160]   Um, how far do I think attorneys generate the the attorneys in the state who would prosecute this would go?
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.600]   I don't know and I also think that if we leave this as it is we're just going to get
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.320]   years of legal cases why this is figured out in the court system like
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.760]   Interstate commerce rules, you know, you're like, oh my my state that I'm in now has already said
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.920]   Companies shall not give their data away to companies or to
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.320]   Prosecutors seeking location data on people who come to our state to have an abortion
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:42.360]   I don't know how that works. Do you like walk into Washington and you're like I'm here for an abortion
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.240]   and do you tell google so
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.200]   Like is google gonna create separate
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:56.840]   Servers for each state based on their abortion rules so they can make sure they enforce these laws. I mean, it's a freaking nightmare
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:04.360]   Yeah, and and duck duck go doesn't do it and incognito mode doesn't do it. No, you would have to use tori
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.720]   You have to use tor you have to be encrypted and yes
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.920]   Yeah, it's the civilians don't do
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:16.200]   I don't even do it. I'm a freaking journalist who sometimes reports something
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.360]   No, it's paid. It's a pain in the butt. I was like the last time I used tor was like a decade ago
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:31.240]   I know one person it actually uses it for work related stuff and that's it and it's are they also just talks about it
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:39.160]   They're not a spy but they're they're you're doing journalism. So they have to protect their sources and stuff like that. So
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.200]   Yeah
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.080]   So what about the companies? I we already mentioned this aunt the the
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.920]   Google sent a letter to its employees saying that that they can just relocate without an explanation to a state
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.360]   And and I think that makes a lot of sense
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.280]   Companies are changing their HR policies again. This is just the tech industry and we cover the tech industry
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.880]   But imagine these to happen in every damn industry out there
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.840]   Um, but some companies you can't some jobs you can't move you know, I work for Luigi's pizza
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.400]   on main street in
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.880]   North Calacak whatever Leo says your town is
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:20.280]   Kekalaki Kekalaki. Thank you. Uh, you know, there isn't a branch of leos in Seattle
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.000]   But he's doing leos pizza
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.160]   um, and so
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:31.080]   You know, it's it's another statement of privilege that people who work for companies large enough with policies generous enough
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.480]   And the jobs that allow them
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.640]   To move that's that's a small
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:43.720]   Portion of of of people privilege. Yep. Yeah, so there's there's the letter from google which says that that
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.520]   Um, you know, it's it's it's an important statement to make
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.840]   Uh, the the head of HR or whatever they call it people or whatever
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.840]   Uh, so that equity is extraordinarily important to us as a company
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.280]   We share concerns about the impact this will have on people's health lives and careers
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:08.920]   To support googlers and their independence our us benefits plan and health insurance covers out of state medical procedures that are not available where an employee lives and works
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.800]   Googlers can also apply for relocation without justification. That is to say
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.920]   Don't say why you're moving because it'll get subpoenaed
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.600]   And those overseeing this process will be aware of the situation which is to say say yes when they ask it
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:27.960]   If you need additional support connect one-on-one, which is to say not in a
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.760]   Superitable way with the people consultant pepitol key p capital c
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.400]   uh via
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.320]   Link redacted. So that's what one company is doing. I salute them. I think it's good
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.680]   But it affects only their employees and only as you say in that position of privilege
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:49.800]   And as you say the policy that says you just go out of state for any medical procedures and some companies are like hey
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.920]   any medical procedure that opens up things like for uh
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.400]   gender
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.880]   Gender reassignment gender nonconforming
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.800]   words
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.840]   um
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.640]   So it opens up, you know the opportunity for lots of other things and does make it, you know
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.000]   You can just say hey, I have to go for a medical procedure to someplace else
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.320]   And no one knows so that's that is a nice way of doing it or a safe way of doing it. It's just that
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.000]   We can't
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.880]   I don't have the data right now on the percentage of people. I don't even know if we have the data on the
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.640]   The types of jobs that people who tend to get abortions have I mean rich
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.840]   Well off people have always even when the portions were legal they were able to get them they would drive down to mexico
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.560]   um, so
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.280]   But you can't I mean
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.440]   Having a baby is a lot of freaking
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:51.000]   Work in it's expensive and you can't leave people
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.040]   With that is there like no
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.880]   Oh, you know, it's like no, it's awful
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.280]   This this is this is a good effort from the tech companies
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.040]   Um
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:10.440]   But I believe more can be done. How about these same tech companies that are making a gazillion dollars
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.400]   Do something with the lobbyists that are in place
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.760]   I mean no one ever really brings that up
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.200]   Could you could google say you know what?
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.320]   It's no longer like I would love to see google be like, you know what it is so not worth it to have
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.120]   Operations in these states because no one wants to work there anymore
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.120]   Except I saw that going on I saw people talking about having
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:40.920]   Academic conferences or tech conferences should not occur in these half of the states people immediately came on and said whoa
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.400]   You're and I don't know two minds about this
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:48.360]   You have the people who lack the privilege and lack the money and have those kinds of jobs where they can't move
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.760]   And are often people of color work in those states and live in those states
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.640]   And if you cut them off if you cut those states off you cut off their economic basis
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:03.240]   And I don't know which way to go on that because because you know after after some of the laws the past on
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.120]   on gender
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.200]   My university said we were not allowed to travel to certain states no matter who paid for it
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.920]   We couldn't go there and I'm supported that
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.080]   Uh, but I also understand the argument the contrary argument here that says you know
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.160]   You cut off the half of america
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.080]   Where people need the other the other questions people are saying i'm going to move and I think people actually will move
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.800]   Then any effort to make texas more purple
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.680]   gets set back
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.000]   So
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   In terms of cutting off these places
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.960]   There are unintended consequences which I think
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.920]   Yeah, well, there's I mean there's going to be a lot of unintended consequences from
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.720]   What's happening right now?
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.880]   Just in general, um
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.400]   I
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.440]   I don't I mean I think it's fine if companies say hey
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.040]   It's no longer worth it to have operations here because no one wants to work there
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:02.360]   I do think there's a lot of push there and you can see companies like caterpillar moving its headquarters to texas
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.880]   Just a few weeks ago
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.360]   They did it because they were frustrated with illinois tax laws and the way that those were
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.640]   Affecting them and they announced all the time
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.360]   Yeah, that happens all the time. I mean
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:37.320]   In
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.320]   That is a problem
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:46.200]   What they'll probably do is fund gift corporations more money as opposed to actually backtrack on their laws which then just
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.480]   further
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:55.080]   Tilt the scale towards us relying more and more on private enterprise for basic rights, which is terrible
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:01.400]   So speaking of that now we have we do have some alternatives out there like plan b
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.480]   And there was a story this week that at first
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.000]   Facebook and instagram were cutting off
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.120]   ads for and searches for
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.120]   Mailed abortion pills then they updated and said it was incorrect enforcement and they put it back up
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.120]   Um
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.600]   But it illustrates the point you just made stacy is that is that we end up
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.480]   Behold into corporations
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:35.800]   For these critical things if we can't if you can't go to the to the nearby rex hall if rex hospital exists and
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:41.320]   And buy the pill because it's outlawed in your state and you and you order through the mail
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.800]   Well, will you be able to see an ad for it on facebook will you be able to order at amazon?
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.640]   We'll get to that in a second
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.280]   If you order through fetics
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.280]   Because it's not the us postal service will that be vulnerable to search by local authorities
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.920]   Ah, I mean
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.640]   Yeah, like right now if I try to send weed to texas weed is legal in the us
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.840]   It's
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.600]   They're sorry weed is legal in washington. It's not yet in the us
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.400]   Yeah, illegal in texas
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:15.480]   I mean texas confiscates weed in the mail regularly. I don't know this i'm not trying to bail weed
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:21.880]   One way to keep your parents happy again despite talking
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.960]   Um
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   Well in
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   And I don't need to pry but you have family back
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.880]   in
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:42.600]   That part of the country is a discussion in the family at all or among friends or no, it's it is what it is
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.080]   You can understand that
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.280]   most of my family and a few people in my circle
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.040]   We just sort of
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:57.080]   We try to just stay away from all of it because quite honestly we don't feel like anything is going to be done
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.960]   Or anything that's going to ever matter and it's going to be a lot of disappointment one way
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.360]   or another and
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.400]   The stuff that's going on with the the women's rights is just
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.360]   It's just a tip at iceberg for us. We're concerned
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:15.320]   Or most of us feel like it's only going to get worse regardless of who we vote for on top of that
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:23.400]   Yeah, yeah, which is the bigger issue. This is not I mean like this is not a tech issue. This is just an issue
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.600]   Democracy
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.440]   Mm-hmm. And tech companies and technology is not going to help us with this
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.560]   It can push us over. You know, I think we've seen how it's affected our democracy
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.160]   Which I know you love talking about Jeff, but I mean
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.280]   I
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:50.760]   This is this is people have to get out on the ground and do something. I mean you have to
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:55.800]   We have to stop being so complacent and that means people like us too
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.480]   I mean it means more than just protesting it. It actually means
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:06.760]   Doing the work in terms of like local activism and I don't think many of us are prepared to do that
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.960]   No
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.520]   And
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.760]   It's an all-wee
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.000]   Right
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.840]   It's on we it's just and I think
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.160]   Some people feel it more than others
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.600]   I think like
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.480]   Look, I I feel like I saw this coming in 2016 when Donald Trump was elected
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.720]   Like and I warned people and everyone around he's like, no, no, don't be silly
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.120]   Of course
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.480]   It could have gone. I mean it didn't have to go this way, but it did
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.080]   um
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.880]   And I feel that there are still people like my husband he's he's not I'm like ready to move
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.440]   Just ready to go. Yeah, I see what's happening here. I'm like, oh no
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.360]   Yeah
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.720]   But he's like no, it's not that bad
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.120]   So there's always going to be people who are going who are ready to be complacent because it's easy
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.720]   And I think people who are in the groups that are going to be most affected
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.280]   women
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.720]   You know the thing is I totally see where
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.680]   mr. Andy's coming from
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.160]   Because there are times when I think to myself, you know what there are
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.280]   Thousands and thousands of people that are
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.000]   fleeing to get here
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.040]   And there's a reason for that
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.760]   You know, so I always sort of think twice about
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.360]   a lot of the bad bull crap that's happening
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:37.320]   in our government and say, you know, it could be a lot worse because there's still people that are literally dying
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.120]   To get into these different borders
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:46.440]   Those people are dying to get here a lot of a lot of them are dying to get here from central american, mexico
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.760]   Where it is admittedly so much less
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.480]   Like so much less safe
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:58.200]   You don't see as many people coming here like the number of people applying for us universities is down
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.840]   So you don't see
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:07.720]   immigration and you see the same level of like migrants in europe coming from parts of africa and
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.240]   places that are affected right now by climate change of poverty, so
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.520]   I appreciate that argument, but I'm also like
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:23.000]   Yeah, they're dying to get here because yeah, this is still better than like being murdered by a drug cartel and having your body dumped at a desert
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.400]   Yeah, yeah, but I think the answer went to before was that the
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.000]   It's politically you got to be motivated
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.400]   And you're gonna be motivated if you think there's a chance for change if you don't think it's a chance for change
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:43.640]   Then people are going to be out there and and between this and january 6th, which also has its tech angles too
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.760]   Um, you know, we don't know where this is gonna turn out
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.560]   We'll see I can sit here and
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:57.160]   Tell you about my voting experience. It's especially like this most recent voting experience here in state of california
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:05.080]   Um, no, I'm not gonna divulge who I filled in the bubbles for but I spent that whole time filling out that ballot thinking
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.280]   Not gonna matter. Yeah, they're just gonna rob me to
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:15.320]   He's this person's not gonna fix it, but might as well give it a try that that was my thought the whole day come time
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.360]   Yeah, that's sad. Well, thank you for voting anyway realistic. Yes. Thank you for voting
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.560]   We're your little sticker proudly
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:29.160]   Let me go back to to another tech topic on this just to just to round it out here. Um, which is
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.240]   um
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:37.800]   Two things tied together at a higher level what the supreme court talked about and what tomah's particularly is going after is privacy
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.600]   Privacy is not have we discussed from the show before privacy is not enshrined in the constitution
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.800]   It came out of decisions like riz wall and it came out of these decisions
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.960]   and it was a
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.640]   crafted right
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:54.520]   That's the supreme court at one level just took away and they could take away others and privacy is a topic
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:58.360]   We talk about constantly on this show and it's it's key to
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:03.640]   Uh technology that's key to the internet as we move forward. So I wonder whether
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.520]   Just at a higher level than abortion. I think what you both said is stacy you said
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:14.840]   Well, there's not much we can do about technology. It is what it is and and you said well politically there's not much we can do it is what it is
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.040]   stipulated your honors
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:23.160]   Let's go up a level and say in terms of the architecture of the net in terms of things like an an encryption
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.080]   in terms of
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:30.280]   Statements of rates about about what we should expect from tech companies at a higher level about privacy
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.360]   Uh, I think this brings it home and I'm one of those I've said, you know on the show many times
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:39.080]   Uh privacy is important, but so is public this and I I kind of talk about the other side of that
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.880]   Privacy is important and it's more important now than ever
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:47.560]   Are there anything you would like to see from technology companies different from what we've seen in the last 10 years?
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.600]   Well, I would like to see
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.520]   Yeah, I mean and I've talked about this. I think you need limited data
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:01.320]   Limited what is the word gosh covet y'all has really broke my brain. Um
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:09.400]   You should only keep data for like six months. We need to limit the amount of data that people can keep we need to redefine pii
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.080]   um
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.920]   We need to
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.920]   Yeah
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.200]   We need to be transparent when we buy devices or sign up for things, you know thing
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:27.720]   What is tracking people what is being tracked and where that data is going to not written in league the least so things like
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.480]   Yeah, they but they put it in legal leaves for a reason
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.520]   No, I know what they're gonna change that
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:42.280]   Yes, I think there are user friendly ways to disclose that information. So there are nutritional data for like
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.320]   What data is being collected and shared?
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.840]   I think what apple and google did with their apps in the app store when you download an app and you see the permissions
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:56.440]   I think that's a good way to do that. Yeah, I should also point out if you're unaware
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.160]   Uh the beginning of june
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:05.240]   Uh, there is a bipartisan privacy bill a federal privacy bill a draft of it was released
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.280]   It is epic the the
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:15.080]   I read it when it came out. There is a 64 page like overview of it and the bill itself is
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.920]   mammoth
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.760]   but
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:25.800]   It it applied it basically changes the way that we think about privacy here in the us and way we historically
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.680]   Uh regulated it so
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:36.440]   They're basically they modeled the laws off of the state laws so not gdpr
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.960]   So it doesn't have this like hole in shrying a right to privacy instead
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:46.120]   It really focuses on the data. It says there's certain types of data that will be private
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.000]   It's basically trying to say like pii
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.720]   um in data that can help
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.240]   Uh
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.400]   Point back to a person so think of like location data where you go to your house every night
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   It's pretty easy to figure out who you are from that
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.240]   um
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.400]   It does exclude de-identified data. So it doesn't
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.720]   It actually doesn't solve the location data problem. I'm sorry
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.240]   Uh
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.640]   And then they talk about things like data minimization. So don't collect as much data
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.040]   uh, they say that you
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.880]   Can't
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:28.280]   Do certain types of data processing such as like transferring biometric and genetic information without getting positive consent
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.880]   Um
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.720]   You need to do privacy by design in your policies and procedures
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.960]   um
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:43.320]   They have categories of sensitive data. They have they actually bring children's data. They make it private until the age of 17
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.800]   Uh
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.840]   They actually I think that's great. I've been wanting that for a while
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.800]   Um
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:56.600]   They need data brokers will have to register with the ftc and they have to provide like audit logs and share that data
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:03.160]   Um, there's a lot of stuff about data security. There's classification of companies as like large data handlers
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.320]   Um, and that's based on how much data you have and how much money you make on it
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:13.240]   Um, and it puts the enforcement at the federal and the state attorney's general level
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:19.160]   Um, there's a lot of stuff that isn't in there, but it's just a draft and we don't know if that'll happen
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.120]   But I just wanted y'all to know that that's out there and
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:29.400]   So politically, what are you hearing about about uh, right versus left and tech versus
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.120]   um, media
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.120]   Views of a bigger yet
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.920]   Because things kind of blew up when it came out on a friday and then the week after that
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:44.200]   I feel like something big happened and I mean it feels like something big's happening all the time
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.840]   um
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.360]   So we haven't I I I don't see a lot of people
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.640]   Talking about it
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   yet
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.160]   Oh, but I can stick the little draft in the here
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:04.840]   No, yeah, do thank you for that that you've read it more than I have so I'm actually glad to have gotten that that little pressy there
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:09.720]   That's great. All right one more question then we'll then we'll go to leo to do it a commercial
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.320]   um
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:15.480]   And an encryption tore as a pain. We just we just all said shrugged and said we don't do it
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.880]   um
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.280]   Yeah, some message applications are encrypted
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:25.080]   Is there but but I don't think we have a lot of faith in that
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.080]   um
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:32.920]   We don't have I don't think I have faith in the messaging apps with the encryption because of this
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.920]   They're just not mainstream enough
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.160]   Uh, it's just not a reason to get people to but it install it could be
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.600]   That's my question is what would it take to make encryption?
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   uh
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.080]   More demanded both on the company side and on the client side on our other on the consumer side
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:54.360]   I don't think this is no different and and I'm not trying to be funny or anything
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.800]   But I don't think that argument or question is no different from
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:03.160]   Or why not get people to move from facebook to this new social media platform
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.960]   Because it's got this bill and it was so blah blah blah
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:11.240]   And it's because of the the barrier to entry is just it's too much for people people don't
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.480]   They don't want to change they'll talk about it, but they're not going to go
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:21.160]   Can you tell me I need to install this new app just so it can be encrypted to talk to my mother
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.120]   Uh, that's okay. I'll take my chances
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.240]   That's exactly what they're saying. That's exactly what they're saying
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   They won't install it
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:34.840]   I'm like, what if gen z so the teenage girls start installing it
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:40.200]   And then if you want to talk to a teenage girl, which means teenage boys will start installing it
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.640]   The parents may install it to protect their kids
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:48.280]   So maybe you don't get but parents might get freaked about it too if parents can't read it
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:53.080]   Well, yeah, because there's always gonna be people who are like, oh my god, it's end to end encryption
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.640]   I mean, it's not like we've settled this in this this country that in an encryption is great because
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:02.440]   I mean, it's hard enough to get people to just use vpn on anything
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:08.280]   Well, this is a bit of cheery beginning to the show. Yeah way to go
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.600]   All right. All right, so i'm gonna i'm gonna do one more other thing here
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.960]   I don't see any initials in the in here yet, but when we do the commercial you start looking through
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.200]   But i'm gonna give you one story for a cheery moment
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.920]   lines 70
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:26.920]   Taco Bell has announced a tostata on a giant
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.920]   Cheez-it
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:34.600]   18 times the size of a regular cheese it now this is important news
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:42.120]   Wouldn't you agree it it combines our favorite foods taco bell in t so hard into k so
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.800]   But wait, is it like it says cheese at tostata
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.360]   It's a cheese cheese at tostata. Yes, it's oh six. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm looking at the picture. Yeah
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:57.320]   16 times larger you can also get it made into one of their crunchy things when it's wrapped in 53 layers of more fat
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:07.160]   As well, but I think I think the simplicity of this is nice the cheese it tostata is a major advance in american consumerism and technology
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.240]   What does it take to make a giant cheese it? I mean, that's not that's not easy, you know
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:16.040]   I was like I actually used to know who mandalay who makes cheez-its
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.000]   Or Nabisco great Nabisco. I thought
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.440]   Nevermind I was like I know that I know that I owe the industriate to you this between the factory automation for those guys
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.600]   Kellogg's we're all wrong. Oh really?
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.160]   Kellogg's makes cheez-its
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.160]   Kellogg's mission which is soon gonna be split off
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:41.640]   I actually put this on the bread not last week, but there was no possible to bring it up. Yeah
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:49.800]   That Kellogg's is gonna be broken up into three companies and one of them is called something as a working title something like future snack company
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.160]   I'd buy I'd buy stock in a snack company wouldn't you?
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:59.880]   Yeah, so this is a major of snacks forward in snack technology. I think that's that's that's a wonderful thing
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:04.520]   And on that note for thinking about all the stoners and coming up with this
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:11.480]   Well, you know, what's what's most significant about it is actually that it means that Taco Bell is gonna bring it
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.840]   one more ingredient inside its
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.960]   Protection lights because Taco Bell is famous for only having
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:25.080]   X number of ingredients and they from that they assemble everything, but this is a new one. So that's worth celebrating
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:30.200]   It is indeed and they've been out of mexico pizza, which is which is causing problems. Yeah
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:37.480]   All right, that's that's our Taco Bell moment for the for the week now. We're gonna go and get a break from Taco Bell with leo

[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:58.040]   Very affordable came out of the box. I put it on just perfect. It doesn't fit perfectly of course

[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:03.480]   When's he going on the cruise? I think that's he's going on the cruise on the 15th or 15th
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.760]   Oh, he hits the atle. I think on the 15th. Oh
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:12.920]   I'm very confused. I'm very confused. Don't don't let city Leo just just leaves me. All right. All right
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.520]   So this is a democracy
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.840]   So there are other big stories to get which we probably should get to but it be democracy
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.920]   And the fact that I've already used up my free bloomberg articles for the month
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.960]   I put this one in there and the rundown as stacy bait
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.640]   Hope you would explain it to me because I I can't read it because I've gone over my allocation
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.560]   So adt and google stay tasty. Explain what's going on? Yeah
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:41.000]   So we actually talked about this on my show so tomorrow you can you can skip the section of my show tomorrow if you listen
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:48.360]   Um, but this is this is actually a delightful article as a journalist. I have to say the article starts out with
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:54.920]   We're in where are we palmetto bay florida underneath the thomas concave painting
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.440]   with
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.200]   an installer for adt
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:05.320]   And I just like I know exactly what kind of home this is and who it's for in the audience, right?
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.920]   I'm like, I'm like, all right. So this is talking back in august 2020
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:15.160]   Google purchased a 6.6 percent stake in adt the security company
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.400]   Um, I think it was 450 million dollars and this is basically
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:26.520]   Saying two years later. What has come of this and the answer for google is yeah, maybe not that much but for adt
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.600]   it's been huge and
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:33.080]   It talks about you know adt is bundling some of google's
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:38.280]   Smart home hardware like the nest doorbells cameras
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.920]   displays
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.200]   thermostats
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:47.560]   All that in with adt's other sensors and alarm things and they're trying to build
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.200]   solutions for
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:57.800]   Customers what google gets out of this is basically they sell more nest devices they get access to this huge base of installers
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.840]   And this is so important because the smart home is such a pain in the butt to install good lord
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.400]   And most people don't want to do it and it also puts it in like old people's homes
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:16.120]   I shouldn't say old people but older people who may not be smart home aficionados, right? These are not the people who buy adt
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:21.880]   Um and the other thing is google's gonna get that data from them
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.000]   We were all about that data
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.160]   So it gets that demographic data
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.800]   And adt gets to appear
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:41.640]   Like with it hip and with the times and it addresses because they've really had clunky old yucky equipment that nobody really cares for
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.920]   Um without it
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:47.400]   So now to deal like this what adt have gone out of business eventually because it just was so old and clunky
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:54.280]   No, well, maybe but adt the stat in the story was like 80 percent of its revenue is recurring revenue from people
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.280]   So they really had no reason to care
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.760]   They're just like
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:02.280]   Unless the cool is a team lean more on the enterprise side of things
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:07.640]   No, no, they're very good. You know those little home home. No, no, they're super consumer
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:13.160]   Okay, I wasn't sure it was just grandmas house. You know, yeah, you see those everywhere
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:20.360]   But I think i'm seeing more and more of the the rings and wise the all the other security camps
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.760]   Well, that's what in adt was like no a day. They saw I mean they saw this coming adt
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:32.520]   Actually in 2013 invest in a cup of cults on off to help like make it smarter and get into that space and they fit right
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.760]   um
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.120]   so
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.560]   You know what the sad thing is though with with that said
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.440]   That ain't stopping people
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:49.320]   People are still walking up. They see your camera and like hey, I'm gonna just check and see what's in your car right now
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.480]   And literally wait, it's true camera. You know, it's
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:59.560]   It's like does that even matter anymore the sign used to deter people back in the 90s
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.960]   What do you recommend for for security these days miss iot?
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.400]   It depends on who you are. I mean I
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.520]   I shouldn't say this. I don't have a security system because I don't think they're really worth the money
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.160]   um
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.560]   I think it I also live in a pretty safe place. That's the other thing. Yeah, I
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:25.960]   If you've got like porch pirates. Yeah, I recommend a doorbell camera tied to an alarm
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:31.080]   Um, I really and there's some really cool things like vivid actually just introduced
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.360]   I think this is actually really cool and this is all AI based basically
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.840]   They have a doorbell camera that's linked to
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:41.560]   An alarm system and a light and they'll see if someone is at your door
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:47.160]   And it's not someone it recognizes and they linger there for more than x number a second so you can set this up
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:51.880]   Your doorbell will start going beep beep. It's like the car alarm effect, but
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.680]   It's possibly a little bit more now that way
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:47:01.640]   So so it's using facial recognition number one, right? It is it's using image recognition on your face locally
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:06.120]   So it only stores your family's faces locally and if it's not one of those
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.360]   um
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.360]   It actually may not sounds mighty
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.920]   Unhospitable
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.800]   Well, if someone gets up and brings your doorbell, it's not going to beep at them
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:25.640]   But it's like if if I come up and I like try to take your package it will yell at me or if I like boider
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:31.720]   What if you're and you don't have to turn that each or on dropping the package off
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:39.480]   Yeah, that that person's dropping and going so it knows why so it's it's it's a better time. Oh, okay
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:46.520]   That makes sense. I'll go with so my my 96 year old father if he tried to very slowly get up the stairs
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:51.880]   It's gonna yell at him and give him a heart attack very nice. Yeah, that's nice. You don't have to turn it on
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:55.000]   Hi
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.080]   Do you believe it's kind of want to make you reveal anything about your home? Do you believe in security and
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:06.040]   Well, I'm sort of like what mr. Stacey says. I think there are a bit of a waste and let's um
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:10.600]   Because most of the time by the time they go off is too late
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.880]   You know, they've already done the damage if you will
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:19.560]   Um, but it's nice to be able to try to minimize the damage. So there's that
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:26.200]   But yeah, for me. I definitely have the cameras around here just to keep an eye out on things because
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.920]   There's a lot of homeless people that roam around and they've been quite curious
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.600]   I've seen it with my own eyes and I've seen it on camera and um
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:41.800]   You know fortunately it it it hasn't been a bunch of times, but it was enough times for me to you know, notice it
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:47.640]   We used to have a neighbor or a dog named kylo
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.760]   Yeah, that helps that helps
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:55.560]   Um, yeah, I think a dog is probably more effective than a home security system in a case
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.840]   Yeah, a cat. However, it doesn't do jack
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.960]   That goes right out of the bed
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.600]   But then well, I must give biscuit some credit to biscuit is the tiny one of the bunch but
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:10.680]   Biscuit hears anything in these parking which can be annoying
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.160]   But at three of the morning when I hear him bark and it's usually for a reason
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.600]   Does he be protects you?
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:24.600]   So he people stole my adorondack chairs off of my porch in one of my house
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.400]   No
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:31.480]   Like an old house not not I don't have more than one house but like older house and my dog slept through the whole thing
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.560]   I walked out on the front porch and I was like
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:40.360]   What happened and then I was like, oh, it must be this this is my brain. I was like, oh, it must have been my dad
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:44.760]   I was expecting him and my parents to show up this morning. They must have gotten here early and he moved it to prank me
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.040]   So I walked around the house looking for the chairs. I was like, surely they're here
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:53.880]   Well, that's what the dog was thinking too. Oh, they're pulling that prank. All right. I'm just gonna sleep. Yeah. Yeah
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.080]   I don't care. I don't care
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.760]   Um
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.840]   All right, so we so we are big stories. Let's just take democracy to this level here
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:06.920]   You guys pick which one we don't talk about which probably talk about a few big stories here. We got
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.560]   the elan report of the week
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:16.040]   Missy, easy my news. We've got uh, Trump and truth social uh, the problems there related
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.680]   we have google and
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:24.920]   Some controversy interesting controversy around uh, whether political emails go to span
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:31.640]   We have a little bit on january 6 and how that's been kind of made for the internet and we have
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:37.000]   Instagram looking at young people's faces to figure out how old they are with technology
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:43.880]   Which one of them man they should not do that. This is where audits come from. We'll talk. I'm like, I'm ready on instagram
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.240]   Okay, fine. Go go go. Did you look at that?
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.240]   This is an example of like
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.280]   You know, hi said like you could infer someone's pregnant
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.720]   They're inferring someone's age based on data and
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:01.320]   When you're dealing with inference and that's really all I mean when people say ai they're basically saying yeah
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:06.440]   We're gonna infer some we're gonna infer something about something based on what my computer thinks
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:07.960]   And
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.600]   Those things can be biased they can be wrong, which is why we need audits as part of all of this
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:17.800]   And for a company. I mean for a company. It's less problematic. I mean it just means that
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.840]   You won't get on instagram, I guess but
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.320]   Basically, these are stupid and you have to prove they work and right now
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:30.360]   We do the opposite we throw them out into the world and you have to prove they don't work and that's not right
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:35.960]   I have I have Asian friends particularly who constantly get told. Oh, you you look so young
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:42.920]   And get mistaken and get carded and so on more and yeah, there is that phrase black don't crack sir
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.600]   I'll go and see it well. There's there's that too. Thank you
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:52.920]   Yeah, I wasn't going there
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:59.960]   And is only 21 and look at the career he's already had it's amazing. Yeah, queen prue gets carded all the time really
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.760]   Yeah carded all the time and
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:11.960]   Thinking instagram would get that right now. No shot. No, no, especially not. No, no, so yeah, did this do this trip your creepy alarms?
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:16.600]   So wait, why I guess we should do a little more of the story. So instagram is contracted with a company
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:21.240]   Uh, don't worry. I said no here. Oh christ. I can't get it up
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:29.000]   Uh, I forget that's part of leo's job is to actually talk about the story is ready to get a hard a few facts. Yeah. Oh silly me
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:35.080]   Um, we got to orient all of us because they not everyone reads the stories. Yeah, I know I know I'm sorry. I'm sorry
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:40.520]   I don't yeah, well fire me. Just fire me right now. You can take it. It's a it's already an anarchy
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:45.720]   What are you could take over and it's fine wait? I we're not gonna fire you it sounds like you're trying to abdicate
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:54.840]   I will not be king. Um, so the company is called yote y o t i
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:00.520]   It finds that it is less accurate for female faces and yes people with darker skin
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:05.400]   And then for under 24s its estimates can be off by two and a half years
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:10.280]   However, if the tool is making broad guess about a user's age its accuracy improves
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:16.280]   One 2020 analysis of yoga v system by a third party nonprofit found that it was in 98.89
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.320]   Reliable and gets people's age. All right, so but the point of this is larger
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.000]   it's
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:21.640]   uh
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.640]   And it goes to what you said earlier Stacy about about the federal privacy of regulations
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:28.200]   um
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.240]   Instagram says you have to be 13 to be on instagram
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.800]   What the hell can they do about it now?
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.120]   We get pissed off the kids are on social media
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.800]   We get
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:42.040]   Legislation and regulation aimed at saying you're you're going after children and you're addicted them
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.480]   So do they need to do desperate things like this is this thing
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:51.000]   Instagram can't win in this you know we're gonna get on a bitch in mone about them
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:57.000]   Not having these types of measures in place, but yet when they're saying hey, we need to try to address this
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.480]   There's not going to be a
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.600]   Proper way for them to do this. I don't I don't think there is
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:09.560]   Because anybody can go in there and just put in the wrong information, which is what I'll teach you anyway, which they do of course
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.880]   Yeah, so it's
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.120]   I mean they're damned if they do damned if they don't
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.320]   Yep, Stacy as a parent
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:20.520]   Would you welcome this when your daughter was 12?
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.200]   I
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:26.200]   Know she um, I would not let my 12 year old be on instagram
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.800]   But that's what I'm saying would you would you have welcomed her from being on this dream?
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.520]   I feel like
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:40.120]   With a 12 year old you probably have enough control over their devices still to not have to rely on something like this at
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.920]   15 or so it becomes a little bit more problematic
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.560]   I can I concur
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.600]   That's really tough like
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.600]   I
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:57.400]   Need I want to say that people probably should be slightly more active parents at that age but oh oh wait a minute
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.360]   Go on step on some toes there miss Stacy
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:04.840]   So I'm like but is that is well. I'm like is that fair?
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:08.600]   Um because there are some devious children running around out there
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.480]   But they would also agree with you 100%
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:17.480]   I grew up to 100% but every time I admit I've said that same statement people have come at me
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.640]   hard
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.160]   I know you think you're a better parent and I'm like no I'm not thinking I'm the better parent
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.160]   But I'm thinking most parents
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.280]   Especially people in my age group are pretty crap
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:33.480]   Testic parents and we just don't do a good job of managing and handling our Oh ever though
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.800]   I
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:41.480]   Well, I think I think we have to be more proactive with technology. I won't say you're a crap parent
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.600]   I'll just say I think as parents we have to be more proactive
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.360]   Yeah, with technology and that's hard and it sucks, but
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.480]   We kind of have to do it
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:54.840]   It's awesome that that our these kids are
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:59.960]   Quote unquote smarter these days and configure out a lot of detect this available to them
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.160]   but
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.800]   At the same time they're a little bit too smart for their own good
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:09.320]   And that's when the parents have to step in and like I said be more proactive on this stuff
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:13.480]   Back to our top story. I can imagine
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:20.600]   Uh as zealous prosecutor demanding data on people under the age of 18 searching on abortion
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:26.440]   Who or talking about it or things like that? I can imagine you know lots of ways without proper
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.360]   Care
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:33.000]   This kid is also looking in the UK. They're gonna require age verification
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.880]   to look at port
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:39.560]   You got to go to the pub and get certified that you're old enough
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:44.680]   Oh, isn't that a bad enough use to go to the world greens and say where are the count condoms?
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:51.080]   Uh, you know now you gotta go to the pub and say well, I won't look at porn. Could you could you verify me?
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.760]   Um
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.240]   So you can see how this is gonna get used elsewhere in other ways
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:02.520]   I think I think you could actually use something like that to normalize going to the pub to get age verified to be on the internet
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:08.840]   Which means then you could also look at porn, but you wouldn't be stigmatized because you'd be looking at instagram as well
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:14.440]   What if you look at it so instagram could verify you to get look at porn? I
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:22.760]   Well, no what I'm saying is you go someplace and you say hey, I'm gonna get a verification of my age from someplace
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.720]   Maybe it's my dmv
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:29.160]   So if your site requires me to be 16
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:33.880]   So if more sites require someone to be a certain age to collect data on them for example
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:39.400]   Then you could say this person is 16 and here's the verification data that says that
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:46.520]   And then as they age up then they've already become verified and then they can become they can look at porn whatever it's appropriate
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:50.040]   Yeah, I mean the other the other issue here is for for like
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.080]   Kids who are non-binary
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:58:00.120]   Who are looking for a place it's you know the anonymity jeff costiff who wrote the the key book on on
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:05.000]   Section 230 also wrote the United States of anonymity, which is a new book, which is very good
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:12.760]   And and you know as we often point out it's the it's the vulnerable in society who need to be able to use anonymity and age verification
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:17.720]   Cuts that right because you're verifying who you are and how old you are in one fell swoop
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:23.720]   Well, that is true. All right. We'll put it on the blockchain and that'll solve everything
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:30.840]   All right, and you you mark one of the stories here in democracy day for netflix
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:38.520]   I did and I'm not and I'm not an adage subscriber, but I was curious because we talked about netflix
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:41.640]   A couple months ago
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:49.000]   Notice in how their numbers are sliding from the subscription side of things and then they mentioned okay. Well, maybe there should be an ad version of it
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.760]   uh
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:55.640]   With them speaking with google allegedly is this just to say hey google? What are you doing?
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:00.040]   Can we uh get a little bit of your secret sauce and put this into our platform or
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:04.280]   I again, I'm not subscribed to ad age. Um that that's like
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:11.560]   Either yes, I should have found a different different link, but yeah, so they're talking to Netflix is talking to two companies and I forget
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.000]   Who the other one is right now?
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.760]   Uh, but but primarily google's of most interest as to whether google can just get us in the ad business overnight
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:24.680]   And so netflix could say to google you sell our ads you take all the stuff. What kind of revenue can you give us?
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:28.360]   Um, what kind of data can we give you about entertainment?
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:31.480]   Uh, it's a really interesting potential lash up there
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:35.160]   Uh, do you do you subscribe to netflix? Stacy?
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:43.240]   I do subscribe to netflix and I actually subscribe to a bunch of places and I subscribe and pay more like on hulu to avoid ads
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:47.320]   So you wouldn't know that flexus?
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:52.360]   So if net I would just spend more money to avoid ads to avoid the ads
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.560]   You would but then there's also the other
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:03.720]   Five people are so that are asking to use your username and password, um, which is still not helping netflix, right?
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:07.080]   Well, but netflix is uh,
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.640]   Chomping down on those what is the word i'm
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.200]   I love that word clamping clamping down
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:21.400]   This is just going to be an exercise in translating stasis like post-covid brain lapse here
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.640]   Do you really feel do you really feel a difference? Stacy? Do you really? Oh, y'all?
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.640]   I thought I was having a heart attack on monday
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.680]   I did a workout on sunday and I was so sick afterwards and my doctor was like, okay
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:37.880]   You should stop and now i'm i'm trying to be better, but my brain is totally
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:43.560]   I'm having a lot of heart a lot of hard time with words. Oh god. Wow
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:50.600]   This isn't a comedy. You may be grateful that i'm not on the show for two weeks, but yeah, so i'm a netflix subscriber
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.080]   What did you ask?
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:01:00.600]   If you're a subscriber and would you pay more and yeah, which is what and you're not a netflix subscriber. So that's why you know I am
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.160]   I am but i'm thinking about it from the standpoint of
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:10.520]   Of i'm thinking about it from the standpoint of youtube because i'm a youtube premium subscriber as well
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.520]   Um, because you don't get ads on netflix right now
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:20.440]   So it doesn't cross my mind, but I think about every time that my card has inspired
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:28.760]   on youtube and I go and and watch youtube and these really annoying ads pop up and it really freaks me out
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.640]   Um, it's totally worth that extra
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:36.920]   However much I pay a month. I don't even know how much I pay, but it's totally worth that extra
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:44.440]   A couple bucks to get rid of those ads all at the same time while making sure the creators are still being supported
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.960]   Um
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:52.200]   I just wonder, you know, do people even think about it that way you're from the netflix side of things because they never really saw ads to begin with
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.200]   You know other than it was just their own house content that they were promoting
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.000]   Right
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.880]   Yeah, I don't know. I think I think um
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:06.520]   I'm doing a project about magazine history right now and so one of the only magazines
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.320]   I don't know which one it was but it might have been ladies home journal one of those
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.880]   offered you a club plan
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:19.400]   Where if I subscribe and then I get you to subscribe stacey you to subscribe and you get cheaper prices and I get a cheaper price
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:23.560]   And we've all benefited because you turn me the customer into your sales agent
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:28.600]   Yeah, right, which which I think was what could have been done with the likes of netflix is fine
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.760]   Sell it to 20 people
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.800]   But then it's in your interest to make aunt be honest and not pass your password around to a hundred more people
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.200]   Um, and you get a better rate because you sold to aunt
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.920]   Okay, wait, did you just turn netflix into a multi-level marketing?
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.920]   Mlm
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.360]   That would just happen. Yes, how to brilliant
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.560]   No, the am way of entertainment
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.120]   I don't
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   network
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.400]   All right
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:08.920]   All right, all right. Well, um related to this. I found an interesting that just right before we got on the air
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.160]   uh snap
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.160]   is thinking about now a
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.720]   premium layer
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.240]   Everybody's trying to get
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:21.560]   subscription revenue and if they have a subscription revenue, they're all trying to get ad revenue advice for a son
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:25.080]   And there's only so much to go around in both cases
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:28.600]   I had if you guys use snap in recent history
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.320]   No
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.320]   No aunt. No your hip rather than us
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:37.800]   Wait, wait, you think i'm hipper and you do photographs
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.080]   Yeah, you got your idea. Wait, I don't
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.840]   It it is not he is not hipper than I
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.720]   Not even
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:54.840]   I'm like hold on a sec. I'm not saying that he's he's not you know sort of with the times, but
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.800]   I I'm gonna disagree
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:03.640]   No, I only opened up snapchat to check on the hardhead one of them uses it fairly often
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.200]   Um active parenting
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.600]   That's it. I just check in and and and I'm out. That's it
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.160]   I want to say my profile on there even has like in the the text
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:21.320]   I do not use this app because I used to get all these notifications of people want me to friend them and
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:28.840]   All that stuff. It's like I do not use this app so but I only open it up to check on hardhead
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.240]   And if everything looks okay
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:35.080]   And not a bunch of foolishness and I close it but if there's something he's doing
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.560]   Stupid, I'm gonna call him out
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:46.920]   But so snap is pricing at 399 a month a suppression geared toward quote the people who spend most of their time communicating with their closest friends on snap
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:54.840]   Uh snapchat plus is mostly a cosmetic upgrade the notable features included the ability to change the style of the apps icon
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.440]   we
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.440]   see who rewatched a story
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.880]   And pin one of your friends to the top of your chat history as a
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.760]   bff
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.120]   Yes, that last one gives me my space vibes too says the author on the verge
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.960]   um
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:13.320]   You think there's any chance that a hardhead would pay for this and
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.240]   Nope
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:15.720]   Nope
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:19.640]   I wonder it's like people like to see to see who rewatched your
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:23.320]   You're like if you got like you know how linkedin's like you got
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:27.800]   217 people checked out your profile see who they asked to tell you
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.960]   Yeah
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.960]   Which I don't do you do you do?
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.600]   No, maybe I don't care. I'm a journalist
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.600]   I
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.520]   Mean don't yeah
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.400]   Analytics are useful for people that are getting paid from snapchat
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.800]   So I'm kind of way making money off of this stuff. So I get it but oh
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:55.080]   I think if you do it if you like we're in like what if you just broke up with an axe and you wanted to see
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:59.480]   That's what they should do all the social media should create a breakup package and when you break up
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.480]   They offer all this so you can see if your axe is stalking you
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.120]   Can't you're right. She is a spy
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.520]   Yes, she thinks like a spy
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:13.080]   She acts like a spy or it is just coming from yeah geez
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:17.400]   Brilliant man. They should they should pay be to think of these ideas. It's brilliant
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:21.800]   Geez. I think the amway of Netflix is smarter than that. I don't know
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:29.000]   About a market anyone anyone in the chat the discord y'all wouldn't pay for for an expert
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:33.800]   Well, look I look at that type of information on instagram
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.680]   um because i'm
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:40.680]   I'm trying to figure out how to get the most out of instagram for my
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.760]   Business, you know, so i'm going to look to see how many people are looking at this
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:50.520]   This story who is actually tapping and replying so on and so forth because this that's useful information
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.920]   fortunately, I'm not paying a
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.000]   A dollar for it. I'm just paying for it through
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:03.000]   Facebook's data collection, you know, I just don't think anybody uses snapchat is going to do that unless they have some sort of
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.560]   Monetary gain coming from it
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.520]   Yeah, an investment if you will
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.920]   I want to go back to see this. Yeah, there are businesses on there
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.600]   That's what i'm saying if anybody's going to do that it would be the brands
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:22.280]   Possibly because they're looking at it's just analytics more analytics for them to figure out their next campaign
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.520]   No, that makes sense. I didn't realize brain
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.200]   I'll go back to stacey's business. So stacey. How long you been married now
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:35.080]   20 years no 20
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.720]   I think so so post internet you got married
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.960]   Yeah, yeah, we got married in 2003
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.600]   Okay
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.480]   Yeah, we have a cake slicer that has our wedding date. I don't know when it is
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:55.640]   The romantic why am I not surprised? Stacy's not the romantic is Andrew romantic
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:04.360]   I mean he's a little bit more sentimental, but I don't know if he knows all right. All right, all right, maybe we're on our night
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.240]   What you
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.920]   All right now and how long you've been married
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:19.080]   Oh, man, this is easy for me. I could just look down here at the date and do the math in this 21
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.960]   All right, wait. Do you have the date somewhere?
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.160]   No, I just look at the year and that's all
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.720]   Do you know what year you were married in?
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.960]   It was really easy. It was the best year of my life
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.600]   They're all
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.600]   Oh, man
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:45.880]   That's that's real top. No, I'm dead serious to the year 2000 was the worst year of my life and year 2001 was the best year of my life
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:50.520]   That's real talk. Oh, and my family knows that because I've given them the story
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:55.240]   All right, so now what I want to know is Stacy's business
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.600]   Has
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.720]   I know the answer this is yes in all cases. Did you look up x's
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:09.400]   Me have you looked up x's? Yes, you okay. Hold on. I this is super personal. Um
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.240]   That's why it's fun. He warned you
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:20.280]   No, I'm so my last x like I've only dated like two people three people of my life
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:25.880]   Uh, so this is like uh, I got I was a child, brith. I got married when I was 23
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.400]   So oh, I'm 43. I got married when I was 20
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:36.280]   Anyway, I might be 44
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:39.240]   We literally just like
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:46.680]   COVID brain affects all kinds of things. I just I just don't have a sense of time. I mean anyway, the point is
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.120]   so my big x
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:55.720]   There was no facebook. There was no social anything right maybe we had my space
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.880]   Yeah, I got married in 2003 or two
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:07.880]   What are those? What I'm at where I'm going is this if someone looked up you would you find that charming or creepy?
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.800]   And you and the content you said oh state. See I wonder how you're doing
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.960]   Oh, next
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.600]   Oh and x
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.640]   Yeah
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.640]   I mean
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:24.200]   No, maybe I don't
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:29.800]   I'm not good at social things. Um
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.680]   Or man
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.000]   Or math or time or words really just bad at everything day
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.080]   No, you're clean. You're very clean and I appreciate that's true. I just shower
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:49.720]   Um, yeah, so I'm thinking back
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:55.880]   I mean, I think my x from high school reached out on linkedin
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.840]   Like 10 years ago and that wasn't creepy
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.480]   Okay, that's good
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:07.560]   So but I like it's only right after like a breakup that I think you would be weird
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.800]   Lots more. You're like your business. So there's a there's a certain time
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.480]   When you want to when you want to um spy on somebody
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:22.600]   There you go. I mean, isn't that a thing that people do they're like cyber stock their x just to see or they do
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:28.040]   This is all theoretical to me because I again don't interact with people this way
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:34.120]   At what about you to do what about me? What you up? Did you look up anybody
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:41.160]   People I I would get notifications that so-and-so started following me in in
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.080]   a little
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:48.040]   You know light bulb golf like wait a minute. I remember that name and then I had to go back and look
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.720]   um
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:54.600]   And most of the time I was just sort of smiling to myself snarky if you will because
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.800]   Those people that really didn't care about me back in the days anyway, they usually talk crap about me
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:05.000]   But yet now you're following me. Ha ha ha. I'm not following you. It was you know that kind of stuff for me
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.320]   Yeah
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:13.000]   All right different story here. So I'm I'm gonna pick this one. I'm fascinated by google and
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.800]   campaign messages in spam
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:21.240]   So a bunch of conservatives went after google saying
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.680]   that
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.760]   you're you're
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:32.360]   Discriminated against us because we're right wing you're putting our stuff in spam and god bless mike maznick
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.280]   uh the magnificent mike
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:41.720]   Uh did a great story about this looking into it further and finding that it was victory the same company that
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.760]   Facebook hired to go after tiktok
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.160]   And what mike says is basically they're really bad at email
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.840]   And they tried to make an issue out of
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.600]   uh
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.040]   Not being
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.760]   They're being able getting through for their client their republican clients
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:03.960]   So they made it do an issue because they like to complain that silicon valley is not fair to them
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:10.520]   And so they went after that so then google comes back and says oh, okay. We're gonna propose a policy
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.840]   Uh to keep campaign messages out of spam
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.800]   Okay, then what happens then the democrats say whoa
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:26.520]   If if the other side sends a whole bunch of spam crap they should be in spam and you just yeah
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:31.160]   Uh, deal to them far too soon. You should hold on more
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.880]   That's the thing another example of
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.040]   They can't win
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.520]   Well, that's the thing. Where do you draw the line on this?
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.040]   um
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:44.280]   Because i was a jim was the name jim norman jim what if his name?
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:47.800]   What's the guy jim jordan?
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:53.080]   Jim jordan i remember seeing him on on the screen fussing about this stuff and
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:58.040]   At the time i was thinking to myself well, maybe your email is just bad
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:03.000]   Uh, but then again, this is this is a problem
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.200]   This could be a problem for everybody not just the republicans and the right it's could be a problem. They should listen
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:15.320]   They should listen to the users like right i mark i can't tell you like i love betto
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:22.760]   But dear god his campaign sold my email to everybody and their freaking dog or maybe it was at blue. I don't know

[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:34.520]   Yeah, yeah, I think that's what so well, but i'll have you know by the way
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:39.560]   I just received a invitation to the official 2022 republican advisory board

[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:07.240]   Um, it doesn't put it in spam or there may be more in span but it puts it in my um, what do you call it?
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:13.480]   Promotions promotions or something other yeah, so i was we're just absolutely everything spams
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:17.000]   Yeah, oh no some of my promotions are great
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.400]   But at the same time there are some people that support those campaigns that wants to see
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:27.320]   That community well i actively mark mine as spam
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:31.880]   Yeah, don't i mean so i feel like that's does it disappear then
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:36.840]   But those into spam i don't open my spam for you i said obviously right
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.080]   Well, well but when they go around when they go to the next
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:44.520]   Trick or the next email address or the next candidate or the next whatever are you regularly marking things for spam
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.720]   No, no, no really took a while
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:53.880]   I don't want to say i have one yet, but yeah, i think so. Oh wow. Oh
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.840]   How about you aunt do you get political spam?
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:02.760]   Uh not as much as i used to thank goodness thank goodness
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.560]   Oh, i get tons and and your race t c i get it from candidates
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:11.000]   Who i have nothing to do with in places far far away
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.200]   Um, you know i've got to give to my own congressmen's campaign which i haven't done yet which i will do tonight
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.160]   I gotta remember do that tonight uh tom malonousky is a good guy
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.400]   um, but
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.760]   I'm getting him from like dabraska. Why would i give that headed in a brassica?
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:29.320]   You know it costs nothing to do
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.040]   Act blue is kind of evil if you ever donate through act blue. I think that's an issue
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:38.040]   I'll be honest. How did you track it down? Did you do?
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:43.960]   Um like this is what i do for a lot of stuff that i sign up for if i'm signing up for service
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.400]   And it's asking for the email address because i have my domain
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:51.160]   I will call the email address service at
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.960]   Aunt pruit.com
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.480]   Um, and so when i see that pop up later on in spam
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.880]   I just check
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:05.480]   Okay, this came to what email address? Okay, so service just sold my information and then i usually
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:09.160]   Cut ties with them or whatever. Is that how you figured it out?
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:12.200]   Um
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:17.160]   Like yeah signing up as stacy plus blah blah blah plus, you know act blue edgy mill. Yeah
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:22.840]   Yeah, so yes, basically creating a custom like a nailing this if you will
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:25.720]   Yeah
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:29.560]   So here's more details in the story. Go ahead stacy go you first. Oh no go ahead
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.920]   No, i'm just gonna go into the details of the story
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:35.320]   I want to hear the details. What if that changed?
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:35.880]   Oh, okay
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.840]   You know how i like details before i comment i want to know what i'm talking about
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:43.240]   Don't know this is this anarchy where we're reversing everything. It's upside down day
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:45.720]   We do the blather first then the facts
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:46.840]   Um
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:52.600]   So google's plan which was first reported by axios says the verge would allow candidates political party committees
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:59.720]   And leadership political action committees to apply for a special pilot program that would make their messages exempt
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.760]   From google's spam detection system
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:10.280]   What's what's this privilege me about this? It is and the idea was proposed to the federal election commission
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:17.160]   In a in a june 21st filing asking for their approval. Now. I don't know why they would have to approve this google can make it a policy
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.240]   i'm not sure
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.280]   Um, and so the google is making their quest to the fefc
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:23.960]   Uh
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.600]   Greg's doleb stu be republican florida. I have no idea pronounce his name
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:35.000]   Was the first republican to suggest the gop campaign emails were wrongly flagged as spam
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.440]   Uh, my parents have a gmail account aren't getting my campaign emails. He told
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.400]   the sundar perchai
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.400]   During a high level executive medium
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.280]   She was raised once again
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.640]   Exactly
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:53.960]   Uh after a north carolina university study found the gmail was more likely to mark republican emails as spam
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.920]   Well because they send out 20 times more
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:00.040]   That's why
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:04.040]   Oh, I I will be based on what I get it's they're they're just
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:10.040]   Conson well, especially trump the trump stuff is just funny. You were getting the eric trump stuff and it was it was hilarious
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:15.560]   Uh for a while there you've been selected you could have you could go to a call for a round a call for dad
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.640]   It was only fine but right now
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.160]   um
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.880]   Uh, I wanted it by the way. I wanted uh on twitter. I wanted to go
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:28.760]   Um, this is a quick january 6 moment. I wanted to get there believe it or not. There are hines
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.720]   adult ketchup costumes
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:35.160]   I wanted to get a ketchup costume
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:39.800]   And and go march in front of trump's golf course, which is five miles away from me
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.800]   I thought that would be amusing wouldn't be one of my proudest moments in life
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:46.520]   But be in a ketchup costume
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.080]   Do it
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.880]   And you'd have a halloween costume
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.280]   Oh my professor, uh
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:20:00.040]   Yeah, yeah, no, I can't do it. No, but I like the idea it was funny. So anyway, so then the democrats are saying
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:05.960]   No google you're buying them hook line in the sicker. They're just whining. You're doing this
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:13.960]   You shouldn't do this. So stacey what i'm hearing from you is if you end up getting the spam you've you've got rid of back in your email
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.960]   You're gonna be pissed
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.080]   Super pissed. I worked really hard to mark a lot of stuff as spam
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:28.520]   Yeah, so that's where that story stands. All right aunt or stacey no stacey's turn so
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:34.600]   You can pick another one of the one you've already marked or I can pick one of the ones you've marked it's up to you
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:40.760]   Um, let's see. What did I mark? Um carbon footprint in cloud?
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:44.040]   Yeah, oh no no no the google queue. Oh no
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.240]   That was more stacey bait. Yes, I knew you
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:51.640]   I went to this lunch event
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.960]   I'm like, oh
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   the nexus queue
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.560]   um
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   I was so glad
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:06.040]   10 years and so that verge headline is google's worst hardware flop was introduced 10 years ago today
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.920]   the nexus queue which was
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:11.800]   a streaming device
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.760]   now I had a couple issues one is
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:21.880]   Would you say the nexus queue was the worst google hardware failure? Well, you know what i'm gonna say was the worst
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:28.280]   Was glass but they said at least glass got released and is is used in some ways
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.400]   I agree. I always use I saw that headline. I said no, it's glass
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.120]   I could have was a horn. I've seen one of these in the twit host office on the back shelf
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:41.240]   Oh, yeah, they they handed them out when they launched it. So a couple of like I gave mine to
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:49.400]   One of at the time I was at giga. Oh, so yanko our our online video recorder was the guy who reviewed it for us, but
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.120]   it's
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:56.920]   It was so weird. It was such a weird shape. It didn't seem like it would fit on your you know, it
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:05.080]   It was before we had all these rounded and friendly devices. So you were like gonna put this round device somewhere in your stack of like
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.600]   VCRs and hubs and rocus and
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.880]   Soundbar. I mean it was just it was ahead of its time
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.240]   Yeah, I mean sometimes it
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.200]   Yeah, and it was
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:22.600]   It only worked with google stuff right it was really weird
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:28.520]   And it never came out to the market right so so you gave away. They physically made them
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.720]   But you gave away a collector's item
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:36.440]   Well, yeah, but I gave it away to another journalist. So maybe he still has it. I don't know
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.240]   Is a chat room Virgil
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:45.640]   Confirm that mr. Howl does have one so I did see it in the twitter host office here recently
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:50.520]   Uh, you can sell it for 50 bucks
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.400]   On ebay
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.680]   No, no, that was only the like the manual 220 bucks
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:00.200]   Why is it too many bucks?
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:03.560]   I don't know if leo over here we get them to buy it
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:08.680]   They learned I mean they learned a lot about it. They built the chrome cast after this
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:13.160]   The design is actually now something we see in our home. I mean like this looks like an echo
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:18.120]   Four in a lot of this fit in versus alexa everything
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:21.240]   Oh, this was way into the timeline they launched that
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.480]   uh alex
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.080]   Madam a launch the echo launched in 2014 in
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:28.920]   December
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:34.920]   uh, you could pre-order it or like it was like invite only when the amazon in 2014 and then
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:40.680]   It came out to everybody and they added they started doing the smart home stuff in march of 2015
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:45.960]   Um, the google stuff didn't come out like the google home didn't come out until 2017
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:49.720]   26 which is so weird because that so they had to beat on this they were ahead
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:53.960]   Is this one of those corporate cases? This was a video. Oh, yeah, we tried that didn't work
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:24:00.680]   Was video only it was only for playing video. It wasn't for speed. It wasn't like a smart speaker. Oh
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:06.440]   Wait, I've got a really double question. How did it play video? What didn't have a screen?
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:13.800]   It was like a it was you plugged it into your tv. Oh, so it was chromed. Oh, I'm streaming device. Yeah. All right
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.800]   So it was ahead of chrome cast. All right. Yeah
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:20.040]   All right, the google home launched in November of 2016
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:24.600]   It's way ahead of this was like an early this was a weird looking chromecast
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:29.880]   What was it was on this who had the first chromecast
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:36.040]   Oh, I thought it was apple or oh no fire. No
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:43.800]   No, it was fire to me. It was a roku. It was a roku would be a well roku had its own kind of box
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:48.120]   Yeah, but then they built it first amazon fire
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:54.680]   Okay, hold on release date for the fire tv was 2014 in google's chromecast came out in 2013
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.400]   There you go
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:04.200]   Well speaking to the fire tv that happens to be in the rundown because amazon has to go to has to face in court
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.760]   a trademark defense
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.400]   against fire tv a porn
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.400]   service
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.360]   F y r e tv and the court is saying yep people could get confused
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:20.200]   So amazon could find themselves in a bit of a mess
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.320]   Uh because they have the brand fire tv
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:31.160]   That's not much more to say than that. I was just saying all right. All right. Uh, let's see
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:39.080]   Elon we gotta do a quick e-line update. What makes this is like the this is this is like the must we
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:46.600]   It's it's no different from the changelog. It's the e-line log the e-log
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:50.440]   Why do we all right go check oh make it quick
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:56.200]   So so he asked for data from from from twitter to prove his case about about uh bots
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:02.280]   They gave him data. He got confused. It wasn't enough. So they gave him more data. They just smashed data on him tons of data for e-line
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:07.320]   Uh, that's one e-line point. Elon has passed over a hundred million twitter followers
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.880]   but
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.880]   Elon has basically stopped tweeting
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:16.040]   He hasn't tweeted much at all in the last ever since the the um
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.720]   SpaceX letter about him uh rooting the company with their tweets
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.080]   But here is my favorite elon story of the week
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.560]   Um
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:29.960]   He remember how elon said all you people have to come back to work you lazy sob's you got to come back to work
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.560]   You got to be here because that's all it matters. Yes. What they don't have enough desks
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:39.160]   For real
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:42.600]   Yeah, and the wife life is too weak to work. Yeah
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:49.480]   Okay, I know I imagine
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:57.800]   The elon segment has been more entertaining the last couple weeks. Yeah, that's it's it's it's it's it's it's the elon log
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.200]   the e-log what do you think?
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:03.080]   You make it a regular feature of the show. I think the e-log
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:06.680]   um, I wonder if you know
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:14.760]   Him not tweeting right now was this something that someone whispered in his ear? Is he is he feeling well that kind of thing?
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:19.720]   You know, I wonder do I care no, I think it's I think it's because he was getting in trouble with
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:25.240]   Yeah, I think his lawyers probably were like buddy that hadn't stopped him in the past
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:29.080]   No, that's true, but never did words
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:33.000]   Oh no, it's not racist. Maybe he's on a vacation
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.240]   Can you imagine elon with a
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.120]   No
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:45.000]   All right, here was other stacy bait that you didn't mark but i'm going to ask you for a stacy because you wrote about this
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]   The stacy at iot on iot
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.840]   Amazon will
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:53.000]   Being able to turn dead loved ones voices into your digital assistant
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.600]   What did you guys think about that?
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.320]   Last week at the mars the remars festival
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:03.400]   And the guy who's in charge of their ai efforts
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.840]   Basically said hey if you give us a minute worth of someone's audio data we can make
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:12.760]   You know, we can basically do anything with that data and make
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:19.080]   speak in that person's voice and the example he then showed was a
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:23.160]   Ted kreba they're reading a child a spare time story
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:32.680]   And I really feel like I don't know what anyone was thinking when they thought this would be a good idea, but sure
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.320]   um
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.080]   And so like
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:42.840]   From an ai perspective saying you give me a minute of someone's voice and i'll get the pro is it prosody?
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.360]   Is that prosody?
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.880]   prosody
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:46.840]   prosody
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:53.400]   The intonation and all of that correct and be able to like figure that out just based on a minute long segment is pretty freaking cool
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:58.120]   So I get why they were like, oh, this is exciting. We could make samuelle jackson and only a minute
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:00.360]   um
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:03.320]   But the idea of having your dead relatives speak to you is kind of
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:07.000]   Everyone was like and I wrote about this because it
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.720]   prosody
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.720]   Oh, he just pronounced it for us
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.800]   prosody
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.680]   prosody
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:19.240]   The spell was a deep but pronounced with a T so now we know thank you google there. We thank you
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.040]   So I asked my kid because like
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:26.680]   Maybe they're a little bit more up on the up and up and would think this is cool
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:30.120]   but they were like that is the stupidest thing i've ever heard and
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.600]   She's they were like how is Amazon doing this to like make money?
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:39.560]   How are they making money? Are they gonna sell this to people and I was like, oh, you were really cynical. Wow
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:43.320]   Wonder where she got that
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.280]   I don't know
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:51.320]   But yeah, they were like this makes no sense because I was like wouldn't you like to hear my voice if I died?
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.640]   And they were like, oh, yeah, that's not you
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:59.640]   No, they were like, it's not you. Why would I want a robot version of you?
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:05.640]   It's not what you're saying and they found it utterly creepy because they basically thought of it as commercializing someone's
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.480]   memories and
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.000]   I'm with them
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000]   How about you aunt?
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.400]   It's totally creepy. I know I want no part of that at all
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.040]   On the record I still have
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:23.000]   voicemails of my dad
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:27.640]   But those are things that are on demand for me if I want to hear his voice again
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.360]   Not actually him
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:35.480]   Right and it's him, you know, not something that was synthesized
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:38.600]   To just be around
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:45.160]   You know whenever I feel like hearing the latest brian cobra since song or something. You know, it is it's no
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:47.800]   I think it's creepy. No
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:51.720]   What about so I've seen um tombstones
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:58.280]   Which which taught tombstones. Yeah, would you want would you want to do that for yourself? Would you want to live on?
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:05.720]   No, I want to be cremated my ashes dumped in the ocean and all of the audio and video of me basically dumped
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:10.200]   No, you can't take away the twigs
[01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.360]   Oh
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:18.840]   What if my child like turns back and sees me unable to freaking remember how old I am and when I was married
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.840]   I mean like that's very
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:22.840]   One
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:29.720]   Well, I found what I found when she started downhill boy. It was early
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:36.360]   Better stay funny in a few months. That's all I gotta say
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:45.800]   All right, I want you know what I loved that you asked your daughter. I think that was a great angle to do
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:51.720]   Um, and you're careful about using your daughter in that way, but I think it was the perfect perspective to hear
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:56.040]   Why just you know because sometimes I'm like, is am I getting old?
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:03.240]   Is technology just moving too fast for me? But and they're really not a good person to ask because they're kind of a techno
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:11.400]   Not a technophobe, but they they really spend more time in the real world than I think many of their peers do so
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.280]   I don't know
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:17.800]   Right. Yeah, I got them screens. What do you mean by that?
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:25.560]   They're almost 16 and they don't bring a phone with them everywhere like I have to read
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:31.800]   I'm like bring your phone. I know it's so weird. That's that's weird much respect much respect
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:35.640]   It's not I didn't do it like they just are not like
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:39.240]   in like their friends will text them. I mean
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.960]   And
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:43.800]   They just don't
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.800]   It's just not their jam
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:52.120]   I mean they they're on tiktok, you know, we we can talk about videos and they do text and they do all this but they just
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:57.800]   Huge portions of their life take place with the phone. No addiction to it. Basically
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:02.280]   I love that respect
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:05.560]   Again, I can't take any credit
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:12.760]   Um, I thought we had a story in here about it about a legislation
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.480]   Um, well, oh, yes, here it was
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:20.360]   A republican FCC commissioner and this guy goes after everything once I was a branded car
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.960]   Yeah, it's brenton car exact means brenton car it's brenton car strikes again
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:27.160]   Um one and mike bantastic's go on berserk on it
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:33.560]   Um wants to tell google and facebook an apple to remove tiktok because it's addictive to children
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:37.480]   It's addictive to adults
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.480]   Yeah, it is
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.480]   Plus plus data
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:44.920]   Data no, no, you're right. Yeah, I was like the data practices. That's a different story. Okay. I
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:47.800]   Thought it was doing it because of those
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:52.840]   the the the talk there was the perfect it was a bus feed did the story about
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:56.920]   Listening to 80 hours of tiktok executives talking about data gathering
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:59.640]   um
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.080]   Yes
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:05.080]   Oh, I did see that. That was the complaint is that tiktok's actually
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:09.480]   Gathering all this data but facebook and google are also gathering all this data
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.960]   They just happen to be us companies. So and you know
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:18.200]   I'm I'm shrugging on that if it were because it was addictive to children then I'd say sure go ahead
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:20.200]   Let's let's talk about how
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:23.000]   Let's do a big conversation about dark patterns on the web
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.240]   um, but
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:28.040]   I don't think that's what we're about to do so
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:34.280]   So that was a different standard would be the ftc not the FCC. He has no jurisdiction on this. That's true
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:38.760]   That's true. That's the other thing. So the story I confused is that california
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:44.680]   Uh is talking about this is this is line 104 which you already had on as what we talked about at ant
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.920]   um
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:50.760]   They could face civil liability if held to addict children in california
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.560]   meta and tiktok
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.800]   How do you define?
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:58.680]   Exaction how do you find yeah addiction?
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:03.800]   Right and what if they read books all the time or they addicted to books? This was was the fear
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:07.800]   I you know I guess gootenberg moment. I gotta have one is by show today. Um, um,
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:11.080]   only one
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.080]   Oh, I'll find you
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:16.360]   Shwarp
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.720]   So, uh people feared that children were gonna be addicted to books there were the women were gonna be addicted to fiction
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:27.880]   That was gonna ruin their morals. It's I mean, sorry is get ready get ready get by your button get ready. It is a classic
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.520]   moral panic
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.760]   Well done well done
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:37.320]   I am addicted to fiction and books. Yeah, exactly
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:40.120]   Uh, it's a choice we make
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:41.160]   um
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:44.120]   And so it's it's the demonizing of it
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:50.120]   So so to step in and say that you're gonna sue the companies because they're addicting children is just using children to be
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.840]   It just strikes me that way. I don't know
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:36:01.960]   Again if we want to talk about dark patterns and things that help get children addicted let's do it but
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.680]   I I don't see that happening in
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:08.360]   Everything else is just stupid politics stupid politics
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:13.560]   Okay, it is well speaking of stupid politics. I'm gonna go down. I'm gonna steal one of my numbers myself
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:16.760]   Um all the way down to my numbers
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:22.440]   Uh, jeremy you'll see a story about off-comm which is the british regulator that is soon going to be
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.000]   regulating based on
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.680]   the uk's
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:32.600]   Harmful content law which is going to be enforced by the end of the year and off-comm regularly does
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:38.040]   Surveys of the world of online and so they didn't want to I dug into it at some length
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.840]   And what was fascinating to me
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.520]   um
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:47.400]   So they asked people about 20 potential harms encountered in the past four weeks
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:54.600]   So number one 27 percent scams fraud and phishing. Yes. I also get that on my phone. I get the mail
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.560]   I get that everywhere then number two is misinformation. Well, should we try to define that?
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.040]   What do you call them this information?
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.480]   Number three was offensive or bad language
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.120]   Bad language
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:11.640]   I could I could get jeremy nervous right now by using a few words, but I won't
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:15.400]   Um, you know that that's that's seen as a harm
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:18.520]   uh using the s word
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.200]   uh
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.520]   Is or BS is a harm
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:28.280]   I'm trying to remember my child. What's k-phomb and said that
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:31.720]   They were probably like six years old and they're like
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:38.520]   They said the s word. It's cool today. I was like holy cow really and holy. I said survey
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:41.400]   They said no
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:45.160]   They said stupid and I was like
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:48.360]   Oh
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.520]   That's bad. Yeah
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:55.240]   Um unwelcome fellow friend requests you ignore them. What's the harm?
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:01.560]   So then there that it goes things that are harmful in fact or another one is content as content encouraging gambling
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:07.160]   Um, that's legal in the uk and every single most major newspapers make money off of it by encouraging gambling
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:09.800]   Now there's things that are are serious here right trolling
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:15.240]   hateful discriminatory content against against groups depicting violence. Well, that's entertainment
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:16.920]   um
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:21.400]   Content that objectifies to means or otherwise dangling portrays women. So I'm not saying there's not serious stuff here
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:25.240]   But you're getting when you get down to that you're getting down to eight percent of the people said that it was a problem
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:30.600]   So then you look and say well, how many people complain 15 percent were really bothered
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.280]   Then you say then off come to its credit
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.520]   Asked people
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:41.000]   Uh about the positive end of the internet. I was I was impressed with that right? So the statement
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.480]   Being online has a overall positive effect on my mental health
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.680]   Only 14 percent disagreed with that
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.320]   So the fast
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.320]   Being British
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:57.720]   Scrolling in the afternoon, but they're not they're saying it's it's most people say yes
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:01.560]   It has a positive effect on my mental health then how about this? Well, how about addiction?
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.520]   We just talk about people on twitter
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:09.960]   Well, actually there is a part of that in the survey, but I don't have my post answer. You got to ask the question. I don't have the answer dude
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:12.040]   Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.680]   Job in
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:18.120]   14 percent. I know a lot of people is this
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:25.960]   For only 14 percent disagree the rest say it has a positive effect on my mental health
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:29.000]   Then how about the state people that's fine with this?
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:36.120]   And again, if I open twitter right now, which I've I've had to slow down a bit on it the last week and a half or so
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.120]   There's so much anger and hate rightfully so
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:43.720]   There's no way I would have assumed
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:45.560]   uh
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:46.360]   80
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:49.000]   86 percent was like yeah my mental health's great
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.280]   Right, but it's actually about half in half here. It's it's so small. I can't see 40 percent strong. It's uh
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:57.160]   mocksnicks doesn't matter
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:58.680]   but uh
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:00.920]   33 plus 10 43 percent said
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.560]   Yes, it has a positive effect on my mental health. Next one is the statement
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:11.320]   I feel I have a good balance between my online and offline life. Oh, yeah, people just cannot get rid of this stuff, right?
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:18.200]   74 percent said yes. I have a fine balance. Thank you very much. No, this is their lines. Oh, and
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:22.200]   Balance between my online and offline life. They are lying
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:26.040]   I can share opinions and have a voice
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:33.400]   44 percent agree with that. I feel more free to be myself online a third degree almost a fifth disagree
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.800]   um
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:38.040]   All right, maybe people self online chef
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:42.040]   I feel I feel free to be myself online
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:44.840]   Yeah
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:50.680]   Yeah, what else might do jeez aunt do you feel free to yourself? Oh, yeah, I definitely feel free
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:54.920]   People don't agree with it, but not that definitely so stacey. We don't know the real you then
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:02.360]   You know a I mean, you know an accurate and authentic version of me, but you do not know me me
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:08.680]   I would never I would never bring my whole self to the internet. Oh, okay. And you're right
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:10.680]   That she's a spy
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:13.720]   Spy
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:19.640]   The covid is making her admit it again and again, but she's a spot. She's only there's a fake stacey
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:26.600]   We see if miss Stacy is saying, you know, I share a lot, but I'm not going to share everything and then yeah
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:29.720]   That's me, you know, I'm not telling the whole I don't know
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:35.720]   No, but for the most part well, there is their definitely standpoint you get me
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:38.920]   You know from a personality standpoint, you're going to get aunt prove it
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:42.680]   So then
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:48.280]   The question is do people feel like they're there that they're overwhelmed by the internet how much confidence do they have?
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:54.280]   Is it internet user right? So they were asked do you do you have conf overall confidence as an internet user?
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:42:01.080]   79 call themselves very or fairly confident is internet users only 8 said and that's so much
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:04.200]   What about
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:06.200]   Every Saturday and Sunday
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:09.320]   Yeah, they are Leo's audience and let's not make fun of them
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:11.160]   Um
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:14.920]   So then what about online advertising? Are you confident you can recognize online advertising?
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:17.880]   78 said yes, seven percent said no
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.520]   Well data data is a problem, right?
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.960]   Surely they feel they've lost control of that a majority 58 said they are confident managing their data
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.360]   18 said no
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:31.320]   Uh news
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:37.880]   Do you feel confident judging the truthfulness of online information 69 said yes 9 percent said feel otherwise
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:44.440]   So then we get my father doesn't believe in the election that that Biden actually won the election, but he's also
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:47.960]   He's confident he's got it right. Yeah, exactly
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:50.280]   Um, oh
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:52.280]   So, but here's the interesting thing to me
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:55.160]   That that that that that comes around all that is asking about you
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:59.080]   UK citizen, how do you feel about you and the internet people feel pretty good about themselves the internet?
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:05.240]   It's useful. They feel in control. They're confident then they asked about the others
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.480]   Um
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:12.120]   Agreement with a statement that internet users must be protected from seeing inappropriate or offensive content
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:19.160]   Well, there the third person effect comes in because both people say oh, yeah, they need help. I'm fine
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:24.520]   But they need help which is the third person effect, which is i'm okay
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:30.840]   But but surely we've got to regulate for others what this says basically is this becomes the basis for
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:35.560]   Regulation is i'm okay, but boy we got to do something about everybody else
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:42.360]   And I was fascinated by this because the off-commerce data and I'm right and I'm reading it in a snarky way because that's me
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:45.800]   Uh because I feel okay to be myself online and I am snarky
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:52.760]   Is saying that there isn't this crying demand from the citizenry saying i'm overwhelmed
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.640]   We're being screwed up. You've got to do something. You've got to regulate the internet for us. Most people said
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:02.120]   I'm fine. I'm fine. Okay. I found that fascinating but
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:06.120]   That is again
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:13.000]   But what i'm seeing is my view of the internet and I have to think that you know the the internet is fast
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.040]   Either remember that the internet is fast. It's not just my view
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:20.280]   So true everybody sees a different internet. Absolutely everybody sees a different internet
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:24.840]   Or we should go back to our friend leo
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:28.360]   Over to you leo
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:32.440]   Hey, I just wanted to rep briefly to tell you about something. I'm very familiar with hacker rank
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:35.080]   Now i'm not looking for work. Although a lot of people looking
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:37.400]   Coders looking for work go to hacker rank
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.040]   Employers looking for the best technical talent go to hacker rank
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:44.600]   I just like hacker rank because I like I take the puzzles and get ranked and all that stuff and that's a lot of fun
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:48.120]   Let me tell you if you're doing technical interviews, especially nowadays
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:51.080]   with remote work work from home a lot of those interviews
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:56.840]   Uh, are over the phone over a conference call, right? You're gonna love hacker ranks new
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:59.960]   IDE for technical interviews
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:03.000]   It's yes. It's an integrated development environment
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.160]   Designed to take all the fuss out of a technical interview
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:11.720]   In fact, you might like it so much you just do them all this way from now on no more in person interviews
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.040]   It comes with 2500 questions
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:21.480]   Pre-made for every possible skill and skill level so you don't have to think up new problems to give your your
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:23.960]   Interviewees you can use their custom
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.800]   Library
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:31.640]   There's a code playback feature sometimes, you know you you give them a code problem and they're fast and they're talking fast
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:35.320]   This way you can slow it down. You could play it back. You can see how they their approach
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:39.000]   You can score them on the skill levels as you're watching
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.080]   There's also a whiteboard and that's one thing that's missing now that we're doing these remotely
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:49.560]   But now you have a shared whiteboard so you can problem solve together and you can see how how your candidate solves problems
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.800]   This is so much better
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:55.480]   Than the old way of doing this. I don't think you're gonna do in person interviews anymore
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:01.720]   Reboot your technical interview process with hacker rank click interview done
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:04.360]   You could start using hacker rank free right now

[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:18.920]   So it stays fresh. You've got code playback
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:23.560]   So, you know, it's like instant replay if you're watching somebody. What did he just do there?
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:27.400]   You can instant replay it the built-in whiteboard for collaboration
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:32.040]   You'll be conducting better technical interviews instantly identifying the right talent
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:38.040]   The best talent is already there at hacker rank. This is a this is just a no-brainer hacker rank.com
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:44.460]   Twig to start a better tech interview for free today hacker rank.com
[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:51.480]   Slash twig with thank you so much for supporting this week in google hacker rank.com slash twig and now
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:53.640]   back to twig
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:58.200]   Thank you leo and i'm still worried that leo doesn't know where he is. Do we know where leo is?
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:04.840]   That dude he barely knows the schedule remember how you remember last week he thought it was Tuesday while we were doing the show
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:06.840]   He's never done twig on a Tuesday
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:11.720]   So, why would he expect why would we all right? I know but these studies of those he said he's on the boat
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:13.720]   I don't know that's leo was confused
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:18.920]   Have you seen the maki? I guess it does that like a boat cabin on the inside, right?
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:28.760]   So you mark the story that I found interesting too google looks to reduce pushback bias in developer software code review
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:31.560]   And I didn't
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:34.040]   I'm not a coder. I didn't really understand that there's anonymous
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:40.360]   Or there's there's there's there's software review where people judge your stuff and that they're finding that
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:43.880]   uh, when people know it's black latinx asian
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.480]   women face more code pushback
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:53.640]   Than white male engineers and as a result it costs more money to go back
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:48:00.760]   And and deal with all of these reviews so there's thinking of switching to anonymous review. I found that
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.520]   interesting to say the least
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:08.600]   I saw that and I guess I was a bit naive
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:12.680]   I assumed that a code review was was code review
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:20.200]   Um, you know, I've been in at what is what is it called the s d l c software development life cycle?
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:28.840]   Where the developers they put their code in place and so forth and they have to test it out and then it goes through a code review from one of their peers
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:33.800]   And well not one other appears a group of the peers to make sure things are right
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.200]   And there's a lot of back and forth on that
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:43.480]   So I just assumed that it's the situation where everybody's on the same team and has the same goal of we want to get this
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:49.960]   This product out and and successful and bug free of course, it's never going to be bug free
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:52.040]   But everything is just bug free
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:55.720]   Right everything's politics everything's about it. The numbers of the story. I was
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:00.280]   Had no idea that it was like that and I totally
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:02.840]   Commence that's what you know it
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:05.960]   Yeah, so the numbers are this they found that at google
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:13.080]   women face 21 percent higher odds of pushback than the men during code review black developers 54
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:16.920]   Higher than white developers latinx 15 percent higher
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:23.480]   Asian 42 percent higher given a high population of asian developers
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:26.040]   Um, this is shocking
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.480]   Um
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.080]   Is that bill and
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:31.080]   I'm not surprised once I know it
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:33.080]   I'm not surprised once I know it
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:35.640]   But
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.800]   It's everywhere
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:39.480]   It's everywhere
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:42.440]   I was totally naive. I would have never guessed it
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:49.800]   But but again, that's me looking at looking at the world to my own view because of the situations i've been in
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:52.280]   and in those in those
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:59.640]   Different offices and departments it was it was a legit team effort just like if I were playing you didn't feel you saw
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:03.400]   Not gonna want to stay see what about it from editing
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:07.640]   From editing. Yeah, you feel you got treated differently
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:12.360]   Yes, sometimes I mean it depends on the editor, but yeah, sure
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:18.120]   Yeah, I mean and I also got treated differently when I was editing someone and
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:25.160]   How they would react to my edits. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, so
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:31.640]   So what Google's thinking of doing is switching to an anonymous system and I'm not really an academic
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:34.360]   Right, I'm opposed to your my faker. I'm just a journalism professor
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:37.320]   Uh, but my new book coming out good mr
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:41.480]   Pretthesis is being put out by an academic press so it was sent out for review
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:47.320]   And I was nervous as hell what was gonna happen and it was sent out to I didn't know who was sent back to I got a note back
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:50.520]   Which was which was helpful. It was it was supportive
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:54.920]   But also critical in some areas and I deserve the criticism in those areas and I've I changed the book as a result
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:58.920]   and then interestingly the reviewer decided to out himself
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:04.280]   and somebody I respect greatly I do of and uh,
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:05.640]   He did that
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:11.560]   I thought was a very generous act because then that allowed me to have a conversation with him about the book and ask questions and greater detail
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:16.920]   And and so but by always here in the academia you always hear the joke about reviewer number two
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:21.320]   The reviewer number two basically is going to tell you that you didn't cite my book
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:24.600]   So I'm gonna I'm a you know, but I'm not saying it's my book because I'm anonymous
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:27.560]   But I'm gonna tear you over the coals because you didn't take my book
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:32.600]   Um, and so anonymity has its political issues too
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:38.840]   But I think this makes perfect sense given the data here that geez they should switch to anonymous
[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:41.800]   Stacy well, it's possible depending. I mean like
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:48.920]   As an editor like or as a writer and as an editor really knowing whose work I was editing or
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:52.200]   Whose work I was who who was editing my work?
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:56.200]   I could I mean, I'm not gonna lie when I was at fortune
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:00.200]   Some of my editors had no freaking clue about what I was writing about and you know
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:04.200]   I tried to explain it and I would always try to take their like
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:10.120]   Oh, I clearly did not explain this well, but you know, there were some things that I was just like oh god
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:17.000]   You don't know what you're talking about. Okay. Yeah, um and I would I I could easily figure that out based on who was
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000]   Editing me and I don't know if that's good or not now that I think about it
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.680]   I'm like maybe my would have been a better writer if I had just said clearly
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:28.440]   I'm not making my point across to everyone, but can you? I don't know
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:31.640]   I have become editorially feral
[01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:34.440]   Blogging did it to me
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:38.240]   I don't I don't want to imagine when you were not feral when you were
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:40.240]   Hey, hey
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:41.280]   Yeah
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:42.160]   Um, no in fact
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:46.640]   I'm nervous about the book because I I was wish there were another reviewer because I because it's a big project
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:50.240]   And I don't want to screw up and so I want that that that backup
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:55.360]   But yeah, when it comes to just basic I have pulled magazine pieces because they butchered them and I said no
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.920]   I'm not doing it. Just not doing it. I'm too old now
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:00.160]   Bye
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:02.880]   I then I go meow under a porch somewhere
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:07.680]   Well, yeah, I mean I've I've I'll argue with people
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:12.240]   Um, but I I'm typically like I love editing. I love my editors
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:17.280]   I think they're the best people in the planet most of the time so but you've had some better tell me you've had some bad editors
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:22.880]   Oh, but but yeah, but looking at code review versus you all in
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:24.960]   You're yeah
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:26.400]   writing
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:32.800]   That code is either going to run or it ain't and if it does run can it run more efficiently if you have
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:39.520]   Specific calls and stuff like that. That's why I was so that's why I was so naive to all of this because I figure
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:43.600]   You know when the the review comes in and the reviewer
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:49.200]   Reviewing team says you know what maybe you should look at this function or maybe you should look at this call whatever
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:55.440]   I figured that's just for the better of the of the team. I would have never assumed this was oh gosh this
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:01.520]   Woman doesn't know what she's talking about look at this. She doesn't understand inheritance and whatever
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:04.160]   You know, I would have never thought that
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:10.960]   But would you would it matter if like someone was an expert in go versus
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:17.520]   Erlang or Java or you know like that's when the who might matter in a code review
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:20.160]   But I don't really know if you're just saying hey does it work or not?
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:24.240]   Yeah, I don't yeah, I don't know maybe
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:28.240]   Hello experts
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:30.240]   Which we are not any well exactly
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:33.520]   Leo as a coder would be able to say better
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:37.040]   Yeah, I guess one of the issues. Does it run or not as key?
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:43.520]   Is it efficient and elegant or not efficient or not as a key efficient elegance is a whole other thing. Yeah, right?
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:45.520]   Oh, that's better. That's better code
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:47.520]   documentation
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:50.960]   Yeah, I think I
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:54.240]   Simplize with you aunt that would seem to be these are more rational things
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:59.760]   Which is why again the data bias is never surprising but bias in this area at that level
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.560]   It's kind of surprising just because
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:08.400]   It's people going after people, you know technology is up or anything when I worked at time Inc we
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:14.480]   Uh, had fights over what what editorial systems to buy and I was in the middle of those fights
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:17.920]   And I was I was always amazed how people could could
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:24.400]   Spend political capital over something so boring as what computer we wrote on
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:30.240]   But people just get they use any opportunity to be over somebody else
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:32.720]   And use power
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:36.000]   In that way and it comes out in all kinds of weird ways like technology
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.960]   so
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:43.440]   Stacy you mentioned a story earlier that you you then ooh-ooh decided to do a different story
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.840]   But I'm I'm curious about this one. They story about
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:49.440]   Google telling you how much
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:53.840]   Carbon footprint you have in your workspace
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:56.480]   Oh, yeah
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:02.240]   So this is it this is basically more of you remember how Google was like hey world
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:05.920]   We're going to show you the most efficient way like in maps or
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:11.680]   Give you when you do when you google for flight information will show you the most carbon
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:19.520]   Neutral carbon efficient the one that uses the least amount that emits the least amount of carbon dioxide into the air
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.680]   We'll show you those and rank those for you. They're starting to take that to cloud computing workloads
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:30.480]   So you can actually in workspace if you have a google account and a google cloud account
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:36.000]   You can build your jobs and assess how carbon neutral or carbon
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.560]   How much carbon they emit that's really what they're doing. So here's my question about this one
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:45.360]   Go ahead. No, go ahead. You give your samples first
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:48.480]   Oh, it was it could be things like hey, where is this located?
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:52.640]   Where where's the data center located how efficient are the servers in that data center?
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:56.880]   It I don't know if it looks at your code or not. I thought it might
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:00.800]   So so those are the kind of things that's looking for
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:03.280]   But here's what got me about this
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:09.360]   If isn't that really a matter of google rather than the user in other words if google
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:12.880]   Used 100%
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:15.840]   Renewable energy then this wouldn't be an issue
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:19.120]   It's an issue because google doesn't yet use 100% renewable energy
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:23.920]   Well, go go can't use 100% renewable energy everywhere
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:29.520]   Because we don't have that so even in its most renewable friendly places
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:34.320]   It's still like if you're computing something if it's a workload that's happening in the middle of the night and there's no solar power
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.320]   Then it's not running on renewables
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:39.600]   So and then there's always
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:46.000]   Decisions on so it may be like what time can this workload run only during
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.600]   The day maybe you know so it's basically just trying to make a lot of that more transparent and
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:57.680]   This is a little bit greenwashing i'll be honest, but we're also seeing
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:03.760]   With the esg goals of companies being reported to the sec
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:06.560]   Just more attention on this overall
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:13.440]   The entire accountability industry we're starting to see a lot of things happen around that and it's really fascinating
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:18.320]   So this is an effort from google will probably see similar efforts from other cloud providers
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:21.840]   and we're seeing it all over the place and I think it's
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:25.520]   kind of cool because we're starting to
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:32.720]   Externalize some of the costs associated with things that are not just based on like ROI so not just
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:35.440]   Like the cash outlays it in lays right
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:38.160]   We're starting to think about how this affects
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:43.360]   The environment so it's kind of positive. It's greenwashing, but it's also a little bit positive
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:50.480]   Okay, but it should but but but at some level the big decisions here are not the users the big decisions are googles
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:57.840]   Well, they're gonna have a most impact but if google can tempt you to do a more like more efficient code
[01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:01.600]   They should like a power company. You're right. Okay. Yeah
[01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:07.840]   Or hey, what if you ran this over here? It's a much cleaner data center. I mean some places they have
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:11.120]   not great data centers because
[01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:17.520]   They they don't have like that's the closest they can get and that's what they could get, you know, like
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:19.360]   You can't just pop a date
[01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:26.400]   It's not easy to build a whole new data center somewhere because they consume a ton of power they require lots of water and resources
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:29.920]   So sometimes you just got to work with what you have
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:33.920]   Got it. Oh, here's a whole thing on kukos
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:40.480]   Let's see. Oh, they say they have a hundred percent renewable energy for all cloud regions. Look at that. Well, that's what I thought
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:48.560]   So how I don't understand I'm confused again. I don't believe them. Okay, maybe that's what it is
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:51.440]   I don't believe you google
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:53.600]   Let's see
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:59.360]   If I did anything in there
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:05.680]   Maybe it's oh this could just be a sales tool like don't host it yourself work with us. You'll save this much in carbon
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:07.760]   Oh, uh, I say, I thought it was
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:09.760]   Well, nevermind that I just gave them free publicity
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:14.160]   Speaking of which it's a vote. Do we do a change log or not?
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:21.600]   Do it a change log do it is still google do all right. Let's hear the trumpets
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:25.440]   The google change log
[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:31.520]   See here's a confession I have
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:35.920]   During the change log. I don't get me waffles, but I do kind of take a breath
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:37.760]   I figured leo's gonna go through it
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:40.800]   He's gonna explain it all to us and I don't pay a lot of attention
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:45.440]   I don't I read everything most everything else in the rundown. I don't really pay attention to them change log
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:50.000]   But today I have to pay attention to the damn change log and you just made me do it because it's an democracy
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.840]   Okay, sorry Jeff. So why do you know this is gonna hurt you?
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:57.280]   It does it does so good this one. I put this one in here
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:02.400]   So I find this interesting so I'll start here google is paying the wicki media foundation for better access to information
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:07.360]   What this story is really about is wicki media has created a an enterprise
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:12.080]   version of itself that yes, you can scrape wicki media yes
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:16.800]   It's the license allows anybody to take it you can make books out of it if you want you can do whatever you want
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:21.920]   But now wicki media is doing a premium version for companies if you want to get better access to their data
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:25.760]   Then you can use this and it's a way for google to then say well
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:28.720]   We don't pay for content. We're paying for the executive plan
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:34.960]   Which and I think everybody wins here wicki media is something we love we compete is something we love and they're getting
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:41.280]   More resources as a result for being used even though it's free and you can use it for free you don't have to pay
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:45.360]   Uh, but we're giving you a way you can if you want to which I think is smart
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:53.440]   That's that way. That's the problem with the change log. There's not really a lot of discussions kind of okay. Yeah hang out sins in november
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:55.840]   I am sad. Yeah
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:57.840]   Please just please continue this
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:05.520]   You jumped ahead of the change log Stacy you jumped ahead here. Oh, you don't ever cover all the stories or go in order
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.320]   Never don't that's true
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.920]   Actually, you know what I screwed up that one wasn't even in the change log that was it wasn't in the change log but it is now
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:21.920]   Right there. It's right up. I was looking at the google section. All right. No now now chrome books
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:26.960]   Well, I care about this one too chrome books in the new os 103 which I tried to get today
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:29.680]   And I didn't I have all kinds of new neat features
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:38.000]   Which because chrome book people even smarter than we already were one screen casting officially arrives in chrome os 103
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.440]   I didn't know it wasn't there before but that's fine. That's a nice thing to have
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:46.240]   Two use nearby share to get a chrome book online
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:50.000]   What does that mean? I don't even know
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.480]   Not sure
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:56.800]   This is one for android users because it's not supportive by us. I think you could use it for your phone. Okay
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:00.640]   um recent phone photos appear on your chrome book
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:02.560]   um
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:04.400]   Which if you have
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:08.080]   The way my phone is set up my phone photos appear in google photos
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:11.680]   Anyway, so they do appear on the chrome books. I'm confused there, but fine
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:17.840]   Zip file extraction works as it does on other operating systems good, but nobody should use zip anymore
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.880]   Why does anybody use it where I hate zip?
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:24.960]   Why why not use it? So that's yeah, why not use it? Is it just because you hate it?
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:28.160]   Yeah, just because I hate it because we're just somebody the files. I took the files
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:32.240]   I've got to break it up into the files and I gotta figure out where they are and all that just some of the files
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:34.960]   This sounds like a biased code review
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:38.080]   Yeah, I'm like what is happening here?
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:41.680]   I don't I don't like zip zip is zip is so
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:44.480]   2002
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:46.480]   It's a pain in the butt, but I
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:49.840]   Are you sure you're not the key of zip drives like the little funky. Oh
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:52.880]   Grandpa
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:55.200]   Grandpa moment
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:57.200]   Yeah
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:01.280]   Um play store search in chrome OS launcher
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:06.320]   I just don't care. I just don't care. So I'll keep going. Yeah, I have a chroma guy. I don't care
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:09.520]   Save virtual desk templates for later use
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:14.240]   I'm trying to figure out where to hit you are. Where are you getting this? I'm in the story
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:17.440]   I'm the about chrome book story from our friend kevin
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:19.360]   Oh
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.360]   Okay, seven
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:24.960]   updated terminal for linux on chrome books. Well kevin likes that
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:32.720]   And he's on his chrome book. Yes, exactly and bluetooth fast pair is coming to chrome books
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:36.240]   Okay, so we've done that so kevin. Thank you for that. You made that as easy as you could have made that
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:37.840]   Um
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:39.440]   Back to the rundown
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:42.320]   Uh google hanging out to shutting down November. Okay. There we are now
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:49.920]   Finally how many times have we done the story how many times we talked about hangouts and chat and all this stuff and how many times has it counted
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:54.880]   And the joke is it would happen sooner, but the google people can't agree which
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:57.840]   uh communication's application to use to talk about it
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:01.040]   Because they have too many
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:04.400]   Not my joke is somebody either rim sash or that
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:06.400]   Right, i'm a bee. Yeah, exactly
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.880]   Um
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:10.880]   Gmail gets material
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:11.760]   you
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:13.680]   web redesign
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:19.680]   And gmail only view without chat or meat. Oh, I like that. I find that irritating
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:25.040]   Yeah, you complain about that a lot. So yay. Yeah, so that's good. That's fine. Okay, that's good. All right, so
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:28.000]   All right, and then
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.720]   Uh closing it out here actually okay
[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:35.440]   Chrome for iOS is getting better protections against malicious sites
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:40.240]   I don't care. I don't care. That's the end of the changelock
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:43.360]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:47.520]   It's too late
[02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:51.280]   Go ahead
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:54.320]   Through something in there that's worth mentioning in the in the irc
[02:05:54.320 --> 02:06:00.240]   He's got a nine to five story about how to download your google hangouts data before it shuts down for good
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:01.120]   Oh
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:03.120]   Oh, good. Yeah, so if you're I mean
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:08.560]   If you want to grab your hangouts data, which feels like a lot you have to go to google takeout
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:12.080]   You have to use the web so you can't do this like on the mobile but go to the way well
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:13.920]   You can't do it on a mobile, but
[02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:15.920]   Anyway, you go to google takeout
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:18.160]   and then you
[02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:19.520]   Will
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:22.240]   De-select everything except for your hangouts data
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:27.120]   And then export it and create the file and voila you have everything
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:31.200]   Ta-da. I've never used google takeout. Have you all? I have
[02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:33.840]   No that existed. Yeah
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:38.960]   That's one that's it. That's one of the ethical things they do. Yeah, uh, it's it's a good thing to have
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:44.080]   Well, thank you. So now some government and the changelog again, Jeremy
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:48.960]   Otherwise the universe would not be in order
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:56.000]   We can't do you don't want to talk about fuchsia being on the nest hub max after all the time we spent speculating on fuchsia
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.840]   And it actually exists as an operating system talk about it
[02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:06.400]   Well, we knew it was I mean we knew they were making it and we knew it was kind of for things is what we figured about
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:12.160]   It's for running on all kinds of things a wide variety of computing platforms, which is important for iot
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:18.400]   And now they're making it available for people on the nest hub max if you want to use it
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:20.160]   um
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:21.360]   so
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:26.560]   People had you your first gen nest hub is probably running on fuchsia today
[02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:28.640]   um, and now
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:31.120]   You can now put it on your nest hub max if you want
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:34.400]   So
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:37.040]   What will it enable you to do that you wouldn't otherwise have been able to do
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:40.320]   No one knows
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:45.760]   It's an operating system. So what's the use of what are they doing it?
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:50.240]   This is so you can build easily so you can build software
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:55.840]   So when operating systems that's on your hardware in ties your software that's like your applications
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:02.560]   It lets them it's an abstraction layer. So all kinds of applications can run on the hardware, right?
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:09.200]   And make use of the hardware resources the computer has available to you. So fuchsia is
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:11.760]   normally you build a
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:15.280]   An operating system for like phones only right
[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:18.880]   This or computers only is what historically what we've done or
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:28.080]   Weird embedded devices only and so what's happening is you want things to run on a phone or on a computer or on a thermostat or on a display
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:35.200]   Or on a smart tv and so fuchsia is designed to be an operating system that can span all of those things
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:42.880]   So you could build an app that can run on all of those things without you having to do like an android app or a nest home hub app or
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:46.320]   Chromecast app
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:49.360]   Did that help? Yes, it is. Thank you
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:52.640]   So queen of iot
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:56.560]   You're probably gonna say oh, this is this is stupid jeff. Why did you put this in here? It's so passé
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:00.080]   It's so mean that but i'm curious what you say about the finger bot online
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:02.480]   166
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:05.520]   The hell is a finger bot? Oh, no, I just oh I gotcha
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:10.720]   You got me a finger bot. It's it's only a tweet so it doesn't take long to read into it
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:14.960]   A tweet with a little video here of mashable
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:22.400]   Uh, we gotta go through the ad a finger bot. Let's you turn on and off traditional things. It's just simply a button pusher
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:29.600]   Oh, it's like a switch button pusher. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh, so there's a million of these there are that's what i was gonna ask. Okay, there are
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:32.480]   Do you actually use this is a pretty one?
[02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:39.600]   I don't because I don't have anything that really most of the devices i bought lately euphority
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:43.120]   our generation beyond yes, you don't have it. Yeah, but
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:48.640]   But like if you have a popular use case would be like
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:50.960]   A coffee machine
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:55.680]   So being able to set a timer for your coffee machine because a lot of people have coffee machines that you know
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:58.480]   Even if you turn it on you have to press a button for it to actually go
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:00.880]   So that would be useful for those people
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:05.360]   Okay, they look stupid though for things like light switches
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:09.520]   Oh my god, if you're gonna do that just pay the money and just install a connected light switch
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:16.400]   But you know if you like your coffee machine or if you have like a cool bespoke kind of device then yeah, these make sense
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:22.560]   All right, so i've never been a gamer. I don't care about games, but I guess we should note
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:25.360]   That this is Atari's 50th birthday
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:30.080]   I thought it was nintendo's 50th birthday go Atari
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:35.360]   Atari was designated in your childhoods
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:38.800]   Yeah, we had an Atari
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:45.040]   I remember the neighbors had one and then we got one to follow a year. It was pretty pretty badass
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:48.880]   Loved it absolutely loved it
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:52.000]   Why did it combat
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000]   What went wrong with Atari?
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:57.200]   It was Nolan Bushnell. It was the hot thing. It was everything
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:03.600]   Uh pung it was the it was it just just you can't be on top forever or what went wrong?
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:07.360]   Was it innovation? Um, I don't know because
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:11.520]   After that everything went into those eight bits and in
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:14.400]   You know higher graphic games
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:18.000]   Where Atari was nowhere near that
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.840]   Maybe that's what it was. They just didn't innovate. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:25.600]   I know
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:30.320]   I know Steve Jobs was there and but that's about it and swindled
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:33.200]   mr. Wasniak
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:36.240]   Wasn't he at did he?
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:41.520]   Oh, that's right. They worked in the they worked in the there right. Yeah, it's where Steve didn't bathe unlike Stacy who does
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:43.920]   Steve's bathe
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:45.920]   Just constantly bathing
[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:51.520]   I mean, I know Nolan Bushnell left or after Atari. He started Chuck E. Cheese
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:57.520]   like a cheese. Yeah, oh boy. Chuck E. Cheese. It was no longer has animatronic animals, right?
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:01.280]   The nigga, little creep all the kids out
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:07.920]   I've seen great pictures of them in found in junkyards. That's just the most dystopian thing you can imagine
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:12.320]   Is a chucky cheese character torn apart in a junkyard. It's it's beautiful
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:16.960]   I would want to produce for that or I'm gonna do a story that's gonna make jamboreby all nervous
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:20.400]   And it's gonna make his head explode, but don't worry jamboreby. We're not gonna say dirty words
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:23.360]   This is line 172
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:27.120]   This is compound pejorative's on
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:29.760]   Reddit
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:32.400]   And so it's a data set of putting together
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:35.200]   bad words
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:40.800]   Right because we all like to do that. So like you jerk head. So it's like things we used to do in second grade
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:42.800]   you
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:43.440]   uh
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:45.440]   snot wagon
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:47.600]   Can't be still nervous. I'm gonna say something bad
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.440]   Before I have him he's way nervous because I'm thinking of snot wagons
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:53.840]   gross
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:55.520]   So there's a there's a nice
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:56.960]   matrix of
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:02.640]   Projuration here where you can put together words now. I think the challenge we should have here for just a moment here is to
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:04.400]   Is to come up with
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:07.440]   Bad words that do not make jamboreby nervous
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:11.200]   Like I'll start
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:12.240]   um
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:14.720]   You are a dip waffle
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:16.720]   *laughs*
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:23.920]   Okay, you try one now find one from column a and one from
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:31.360]   from the x and one from the y that doesn't make jamboreby's head explode. I oh gosh, I don't know dude. You can do it. You can do it
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:36.240]   I'm not clever enough. There's no other niches soup noodle
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:40.800]   There you go a soup. Oh, you're cheated stacy
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:46.160]   You're cheating. It's harder to come up with things like soup noodle without a matrix
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:49.840]   Well, you're just in my current state. It's yeah
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:53.600]   It's very easy. Actually, you need a chart. Yes
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:59.520]   Um, yeah, I don't know where we are in the such a big trumpet
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:04.640]   I don't know. Is that a claim that trumps an insult?
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:08.400]   Yeah, liberals create this Jeff
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:12.080]   Um, you're just a poop goblin
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:18.660]   All right, well that was an
[02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:22.880]   Please don't say please don't say please don't please don't please don't
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:25.600]   Um
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:29.280]   You are a scum sucker now. That's one that's kind of known right
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:32.480]   You're a dirt things
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:34.080]   Um
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:36.240]   All right, well, we'll we'll we'll end this right now. Sorry
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:39.520]   Can we call someone awake nozzle
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:44.640]   You can't even say that I don't think so not anymore is winked. Not sold my I don't know
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:46.960]   You can't
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:48.400]   I don't want
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:52.960]   I could call someone a scum nugget. Oh, I kind of like that one. I'm gonna. That's nice. That's nice a scum nugget
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:55.920]   Say I do you like this. I knew you'd get into it
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.120]   All right
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:02.000]   All right, there's there's a hundred show titles there. We shouldn't use either
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:07.360]   Um, can you explain this one to me aunt the rise of the 0.5 selfie
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:10.880]   No, because I don't like selfies
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:14.240]   People are taking ugly selfies
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:16.000]   Done. I don't like so
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:21.840]   At all I am so again selfies. I don't have a problem with self portraits
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:26.160]   Which I've done a whole episode on on um hands-on photography, but
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:31.200]   Yeah, no, I don't know what this so they're just using the wide angle lens to take a selfie
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:32.720]   Which makes it look stupid
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:38.240]   That's the worst thing to do those lenses have so much distortion in them. Don't don't do that
[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:41.040]   I had
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:45.040]   A photographer at my wedding which we're unclear how many years ago it was
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:51.120]   Really wanted her entire family like a photo of their
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:57.520]   entire family at the wedding and my mother-in-law is very like studio portrait and my
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:04.080]   photographer at my wedding was a photojournalist because I wanted those like real candid like truly candid but pretty right
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:07.440]   So my I love them my mother-in-law hated them
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:12.960]   And then when she got to the photo of the like portrait of her entire family stuck together
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:18.560]   Because my photographer was not like she didn't do that sort of thing. She used to fish islands
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:21.440]   Everyone looks so terrible
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:25.600]   Oh, no, no, not a fish eye a wide angle. It's a fish eye
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:30.080]   No, it's a wide angle. It's just that is even wider than the wide angle. Yeah
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:35.680]   Yeah, well because it was a huge group of people like all just standing there like this you're all distorted
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:41.680]   Yeah, I mean it didn't bother me at all, but she was like, I can't use this. I was like
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:46.320]   Oh, man
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:50.320]   Oh well, oh well
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:52.080]   Um
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:53.920]   All right, I think we're heading toward the end here
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:57.120]   But what else do we see on the what do I miss? What have we missed here on the whole rundown?
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:00.000]   Anything that excites you?
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.200]   Waffles covered a good good
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:09.520]   Cover a fair amount well, we have the burger that instagram built. We didn't do that one
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:13.840]   Oh, that was a stacy story. I believe that's a stacy story
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:20.080]   Did I have a story? You put your initials, but it's yours now. You can't you break it. You bought it
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:22.880]   You know
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:26.800]   Okay, what about this
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:30.800]   Mottie's good bird
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:37.520]   Go ahead. L.A. Burger chain that uses vegan or vegetarian burgers or burgers without meat meatless burgers
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:41.680]   And basically the three founders. I thought this was a stupid story. I think that's why I marked it
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:47.600]   I was like this is silly, but basically of course they're friends with the people who do Coachella's they had a lot of
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:52.480]   Famous people eat at their place and when famous people eat there, they're like, these are delicious
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:58.320]   I'd love to take a picture and so then they share that with their sizable audience and
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:00.960]   Voila Montez is now famous
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:08.400]   Easy advertisement basically yeah free advertising absolutely free use celebrities to eat your burgers
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:10.880]   um
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:12.400]   By the way
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:19.120]   You know, I'm okay with the the the new meatless burgers. I've had them. I had them as ever since quite a good find
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:26.320]   But I think that when I see veggie burger in a menu, I want a black bean burger
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:28.960]   I don't want a burger that thinks it's meat when it's not
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:32.560]   If it says a veggie burger, I want a veggie burger
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:35.440]   No, they sell the problem. They're like
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:41.600]   No, they tell you it's a black bean burger or they say it's an impossible burger or
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:47.600]   They don't you you don't just no one puts a veggie burger and gives you like an impossible burger
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:52.800]   It's hard to find black bean burgers anymore. Just pissing me off. I like a good black bean burger
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:58.320]   Oh, well, you should come live in the west coast because they're everywhere here. Oh, they are
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:01.280]   Yeah, are you just by like a bokeh burger?
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:03.920]   If you want to go home
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:05.920]   I know oh well
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:07.920]   Um
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:15.040]   I was amused by this one the maker board ape nft's is suing an artist for profiting off copycat images
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:18.080]   Like you can't just make a stupid picture of a stupid ape
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:20.080]   Um
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:27.040]   Anybody can you don't own the idea to make dumb apes, but now you're saying but I didn't realize that
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:28.880]   um
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:31.680]   Sometimes these things are used for of course added benefits
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:34.640]   And people think they're going to get the added benefits
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:40.960]   Um, so I don't know and are you doing that ft still or you find that still useful
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:43.520]   They're out there, but I'm not pushing them
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:45.440]   um
[02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:51.920]   Just I'm not pushing them. My audience as I said before they want the physical piece of art
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:58.320]   And so as you see in that lower third there ant prueh.com/prints is where you can get some old school in it
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:00.960]   Well done well played
[02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:03.360]   Well played
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:06.080]   Um, so this is related to another story which I found amusing
[02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:13.840]   The times called them accidental media critics of youtube which is basically people saying that they're using youtube to criticize
[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:17.840]   They're not accidental. They're not meeting they're just people on the same what they can say because he can now
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:20.000]   but the funny thing is they're going after
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.080]   Uh, yes after gary vaynerchuk
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:28.400]   Uh, because he's an easy target. He makes himself such an easy and I know gary. I like gary
[02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:31.040]   But yeah, he's an easy target for criticism
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:33.520]   Because he's made of himself into such a
[02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:36.400]   Um
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:42.160]   Good board ape character himself, right? It's just he's he's he's he's kind of a made up human nft at this point
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:44.800]   Um, so people are spending a whole hour
[02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:46.800]   critiquing
[02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:52.880]   Uh gary v online, which I I've got to watch now. I haven't watched it, but uh, I found that amusing
[02:20:52.880 --> 02:21:00.800]   Well, again, it's they have the platform with youtube. It's free to do. Um, you got your voice
[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:07.680]   You don't clearly have edit that's the beauty and the sometimes sad part of the internet
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:15.680]   They call vaynerchuk the youth pastor of capitalism, which is pretty funny at two. I think oh, that is hilarious
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:20.480]   That's not a insult table
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:22.960]   I respect
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:28.320]   Vaynerchuk. I can never say his last name. I respect that's why gary. I never really
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:31.600]   Totally signed off on the whole
[02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:36.320]   Hustle don't sleep narrative, but I do believe in hustle
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:40.080]   I do believe in putting in the work and grind and I just hate the fact that
[02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:44.880]   He seemed to be the person that originate the the message of
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:50.160]   All of you people out there wanting to be be entrepreneurs new to work 80 hours a week
[02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:58.880]   And don't sleep and end up having serious mental health problems because things aren't going the way you you thought they would go and you know
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:04.720]   It's I don't think that was right and I don't know if he ever really changed that narrative about
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:09.280]   hustle don't sleep, but I couldn't totally sign off on that
[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:16.000]   Yeah, there's other people a lot even before we got to youtube there there are all these people write sales books
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:21.440]   How to sell and it's and it's and they just come up with those lines and you write down those lines and think your life is changed
[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:24.800]   I'm gonna be rich now and yeah, it's it's it's a genre of human beings
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:27.520]   I love this line in the new york time story. I want to make fun of it
[02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:33.200]   Even in a world with no gatekeepers and limited moderation a certain savvy will assert itself
[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:37.040]   Like oh yes, even if you don't work for the new york times you can be savvy
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:42.560]   All right, I'm getting grumpy now. I think it's probably time
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:46.480]   Don't you I think it's time for kachowi pet babe. What do you think?
[02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:48.960]   Stacy is right now
[02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:54.800]   I we're going to do that, but I think I'm we're heading into anything else here. I think we've done it all we've done it all
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:57.520]   Yeah, this is the most I see you are
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:02.720]   Um, I don't really know we've been we've been doing this for two and a half hours
[02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:07.280]   So it's you're not this is not like a sad show. We're not shirking. We're not shirking and you
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:13.760]   Clout through a lot of stories, sir. I mean, I think we've actually all did it together with Leo
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:16.800]   We all did it together. Um, this is this is
[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:21.040]   All right, so we're gonna and I'm gonna start with you
[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:25.200]   For your thing for the pics whatever of the week. Yes
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:32.000]   All right. Well, my first one is uh, arrow court arrow quartet this
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:39.760]   Pass weekend. Yeah, I think it is this weekend. I shot some video and went to pull it off of the the
[02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:48.320]   The ssd to put it on a computer so I could do the processing and whatnot and the very last file on the card was corrupt
[02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:50.000]   Um
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:54.480]   Just totally bizarre. I could see it when I dragged it to the computer. It showed that this thing was you know
[02:23:55.040 --> 02:24:00.720]   Upteen gigs in size as it should have been but it would not play and I put it on my camera
[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:05.760]   And it would play on my camera. So I'm like something's really odd with this and I couldn't figure out
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:08.240]   what to do and
[02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:13.920]   The twit it guy gave me several suggestions to try mr. Burt gave me several suggestions to try
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:18.080]   But I ended up stumbling upon this service arrow quartet.com
[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:24.880]   And I think it's called treasure something other and they have this utility that allows you to to see if
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:26.880]   they can recover your
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.920]   Busted video files
[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:34.080]   Uh, you you upload it and if they can fix it they tell you yep
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:39.200]   We can fix it if they can't they tell you they can't and they'll give you a quote to fix it and it was
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:42.400]   I ended up having another solution
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:44.960]   Right after I
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:51.040]   Found that but it was um, but I thought it was brilliant and I was like, oh, this is great because a lot of those things
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:53.040]   You abide the software and then end up
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:57.760]   Uh, it still didn't work, you know, because it was another problem. Do they give you a price that?
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:59.760]   Pardon
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:01.520]   Do they give you a price? What was the price of bill?
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:05.520]   Yeah, they gave me a quote and for mine it would have been like 70 something like that
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:09.200]   Which was totally worth it for what it for what the footage was
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:12.000]   Um, but for example
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.960]   Our very own mr. Um, Steve Gibson. He has that utility spin right
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:20.960]   Uh after speaking with him spin right wouldn't it work for me?
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:26.000]   It's just it I would have paid for it and it wouldn't have done me any good
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.880]   I still wouldn't have been able to get to my data, but this one here it was it was totally worth it
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:33.040]   And I didn't have to pay anything, but
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:37.840]   It's nice to know that they were like, hey, if we can fix it. Yeah, we got you, but if not here's if we
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:40.000]   Here's your quote and if not
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000]   You go on about your day. So I like that
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:47.440]   And my next pick is nikon they announced a new camera, uh bright
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:51.600]   Brighten early over there, but it was actually more like last night here
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:55.680]   Uh, it's a new mirrorless camera and apse crop sensor
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:26:01.040]   Uh, it's the z30 or z30 depending on where you live. This is budget friendly
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:04.160]   You can get it. You can get the body in a kit lens
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:09.200]   I think is a 16 to 55 millimeter kit lens for 846 bucks
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:12.000]   They're trying to push this towards the bloggers
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.160]   Um, it's a guy. I believe it's got a 20 megapixel
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:21.440]   Sensor for still shoot 11 frames per second if you want to do somewhat high speed
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:26.800]   Uh, but video you get up to 4k at 30 frames per second
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:32.080]   So again because this budget you're not going to be able to get 4k 60 or 4k 120
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:37.280]   But you can get hd in 120 frames per second if you want to do some also that's my other pick
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:39.200]   Good
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:41.040]   Stacey
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:44.800]   I'm going with cooking and i'm sorry. I haven't been doing a lot of connected devices
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:49.200]   One I haven't been trying a lot of them because i've been kind of this travel season for me
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:54.960]   And you've had a few uh difficult weeks of disease. Oh, well, yeah, but it also
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:27:01.520]   Just kind of being stuck in hotels for a while. How long what was the total amount of time you were stuck in hotels between the two
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:05.840]   um episodes 14 plus 7 21
[02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:08.960]   That's that's amazing
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:12.240]   21 or 22 days. Oh no, I forgot about the additional two days
[02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:15.040]   Uh, so 23 days in a hotel
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:17.680]   Cheese
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:20.320]   Thank you, clover. Hello
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:22.640]   Um, all right
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:27.520]   My pick is what I it's another gift I got for my husband for father's day. I'm just
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:33.200]   Rolling through these out, but but this one is the june egg pan. You have to have a june oven
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:35.760]   Actually, baby. You don't I don't know
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:39.440]   But if you have a june oven god get this thing. It's amaze balls. Um
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:43.360]   You can make perfect sunny side up eggs
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:48.160]   Um, I know you can put them in a fry pan, but like I always have a little issue like they're slimy
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:53.520]   On top, but they're too cooked on the bottom sometimes. This doesn't happen and nice
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:57.760]   Wow, here's the secret thing instead of it doesn't just do eggs
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:02.800]   If you put muffin batter in it, it makes only muffin tops muffin tops
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:10.560]   Muffin tops. They have ruined the marketing of this. It should be the muffin top pan. Oh, by the way, I can do x
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:14.480]   Yeah, well, yeah, probably it's the sign film pan
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:18.160]   sign, it's well that's like a generation that
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:26.000]   Is we're on the wane. Oh, oh, they're calling me old fart again. I know I know what you're talking about too, but all right
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.760]   All right. I said we we're on the wane
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:35.120]   Um, and my daughter used it to make this was so genius
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:42.400]   Many cakes so she made like put cake stuff in there and so she made three cakes and they she stacked them up as a layer
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:44.480]   So she made chocolate cakes
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:46.480]   And she stacked that's cute
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:52.000]   Then chocolate cake and then iced it another one another one and then she iced around the whole thing and poof
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:58.480]   And yeah, it's really cute. Yeah. Yeah. What's your night's day?
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:02.480]   Oh, oh, I made meatballs
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:07.760]   So we're we thought out some frozen I made meatballs like I make a whole bunch at once and then we freeze them
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:11.360]   So we're having pininis like Swedish meatballs or Italian meatballs
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.720]   They're Italian meatballs. It's pininis. So we'll stick
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:17.520]   Okay, do some bread
[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:20.400]   That's good. We can go back to the sandwich cavity last week
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:22.640]   Um
[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:24.640]   All right, so here's my number
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:30.320]   Google and meta are losing their dominant position in the digital ad market
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:35.440]   Uh, the two companies will account for 50.5 digital ad spending this year, which is huge
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:38.320]   But that will slip to 48.7
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:42.000]   By 2023 and 47.7 much 24
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.560]   Because it has all kinds of new competitors
[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:47.520]   TikTok amazon walmart apple
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:53.680]   They're all taken ad share. So it's not an oligopoly a duopoly anymore. Well, it is right now
[02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:58.160]   But the track is down now mind you the ad business is going up
[02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:02.960]   It's a 13.2 increase 359 9 billion dollars
[02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:04.560]   Um
[02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:08.080]   And I would think the ad market would be going down because people can have direct relationships
[02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:10.560]   Through all these other platforms and there's so much competition
[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:15.360]   Nonetheless, it's going up with the market share for the big guys is going down
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:20.800]   And i'm thinking of doing this for dinner tonight. So there was a little local story
[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:23.920]   Guy fieri guy fieri
[02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:25.920]   Right diner is
[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:32.800]   The guy that most people love to hate and I don't know why he does a lot of good stuff. He's great
[02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:35.520]   He's great. I've come to love my girl sleep by him every night now
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:41.520]   Put him on because they rerun him on TV like crazy he goes and he cares about about foods that people wouldn't care about
[02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:43.440]   He's not a snob
[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:47.840]   He loves the chefs and he loves all he does a lot of philanthropy a ton of it
[02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:49.520]   Great. I like him. I like it
[02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:56.160]   So there was a little news story that he came into town nearby and went to a restaurant. Well, that place is going to get
[02:30:56.160 --> 02:31:04.480]   Jammed so I think i'm gonna go there tonight because you know why they have black bean burgers and they're not easy to find out
[02:31:05.440 --> 02:31:09.600]   I think tonight is a black bean burger night. You're gonna scratch that is
[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:12.800]   Yeah
[02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:15.200]   Little cheddar
[02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:22.000]   Little trump ketchup on there. That's okay. I won't you can't choose on your black
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:23.600]   keywords applewood. Oh, yeah to meet
[02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:28.640]   Spoke last night we had quinoa and sweet potato
[02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:32.560]   Uh, burgers and they were delicious with avocado
[02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:35.760]   Mm. I was thinking about and homemade a holy
[02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:39.440]   Oh, did you whole make the buns too?
[02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:42.720]   No, I didn't do any of this my husband
[02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:46.240]   Oh, I see. Oh, that's might as well everything else
[02:31:46.240 --> 02:31:52.000]   One of my one of my twitter friends shows off making the one look like the best hamburger buns you've ever imagined
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:57.280]   But we can't have I don't think my husband is like if a recipe says you have to do something one way
[02:31:57.280 --> 02:32:02.640]   That is the way he will do it whereas i'm like, oh a holy. That's just mayo. I don't need to make that on my own
[02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:05.280]   Uh, but he does it all

[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:15.040]   No, wait a minute. You say open open as an open source. That's what you mean. I'm not sure
[02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:18.480]   Oh, see half the speech is defining the terms
