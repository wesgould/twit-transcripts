[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show the covers Google, the cloud, everything that's going on.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Really anything we want to.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Before the show said, can we talk about anything you want?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Gina Tripani is here, Mother of Etta.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And think up.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And to do text.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And dragons.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And dragons.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   She's a mother of dragons.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Daenerys Tripani.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Love Daenerys.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Of House Tripani.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Of House Tripani.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Of Be Here.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Are you a pretender to the throne?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I feel like a lot has happened since the last time we talked.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   We had the Red Wedding.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   The Red Wedding.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   The WWDC.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   All kinds of stuff happens.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   So Gina was wondering if we could talk about WWDC.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Certainly.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Absolutely.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Let me introduce the other guy.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York, the author of
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   What Would Google Do in Public Parts.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And Gutenberg the Geek on Amazon.com.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And this is the core group.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And I love this group.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Just the three of us talking about whatever the hell we damn want to talk about.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Two old guys and a young mipper snapper talking about the world.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   That's it.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   That's it.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Gina balances our curmudgeonness.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I don't know.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I could be pretty curmudgeon.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   That's a pretty heavy load there.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I feel.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   That is a lot.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It's a tough job.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Something's got to do it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Joffrey Jarvis, we're going to call him.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   That's what your head is.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I hate it.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I hate him.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   How could they not kill him by now?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.500]   I just thought he was going to get it.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.520]   I feel that he will at some point get it.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.000]   But we have to wait until next season.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   We're talking about Game of Thrones, which wrapped up in season on Sunday.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And we won't give any spoilers.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.500]   There was a proof we could talk about anything on the show.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.200]   Is it a spoiler to say somebody's not going to get killed?
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.000]   I think it is in this show.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I think it is in this show because everybody, it's never mine.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Yeah, wait.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   $1 billion plus.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It's an Israeli company.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.300]   According to the rumor mill, which I think seems fairly accurate now, Apple approached
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.300]   them early this year.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.900]   It would have been a good purchase for Apple.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.000]   They could have used the technology, which is essentially a crowd sourced traffic.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.760]   Do you have maps that were right?
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.000]   Accurate maps because they're crowd sourced and then great turn by turn.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.680]   But most importantly, crowd sourced traffic and road conditions and that kind of thing.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.040]   They offered according to the rumor mill, half a billion, which weighs mocked.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.640]   Facebook came at them offering considerably more.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:28.120]   But as with all other Facebook acquisition said, you'll have to move to Silicon Valley.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.480]   Then Google came and said, you can retain your autonomy, stay in Israel.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.560]   And we will give you more than a billion dollars.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.400]   And finally, the deal was done.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.280]   This is now Google ways.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.480]   I love ways.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.200]   I have learned, I'm leaked to it, but it is the most remarkable thing I have learned lately
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.120]   that I do anything ways tells me to do.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.120]   Oh, yeah, you trust ways.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.080]   I've been through terrible traffic jams and I said, turn there.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   No, you're kidding.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.880]   If I ever not listen to ways, I'm in trouble.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.400]   If I listen to ways, I've found all kinds of new ways.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   Oh, I love it.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.200]   I've been driving the same route for 20 years.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.360]   Just two days ago, I found an entirely new route to work and it saved me forever.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.720]   This is remarkable.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.640]   Never the prettiest maps, you know, but nevertheless, here it is, nevertheless, you
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.880]   know, effective there.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.960]   It's really a GPS device, navigate gas.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.520]   There's some gaming you can have.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.800]   You know, if you help people with reports, you can get a better icon.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.320]   You can change your mood.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.280]   You can change your top 500 users get direct access to ways employees.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.960]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:43.840]   You could be a sunflower, a zombie, a cat, a dog, you know, a male or a female L-O-L.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.840]   I love these.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.280]   And there's some stuff, you know, if you're a map editor, you get to be T-Rex, 8-bit robot.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.360]   So you see the other Wazers on the street, even there's a scoreboard.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.760]   So this is how they gamify the idea of helping people out, right?
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.360]   I don't get that part so much, but I mean, the real value is that because you're carrying
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.600]   it with you, Waze knows what road you're on and how fast you're driving and thus gets
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.840]   the data together.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.440]   I don't know if I mentioned this before.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.640]   I wrote a business plan more than a dozen years ago arguing that our radio reports on
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.400]   traffic are all gone off only.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   Nothing.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   Nothing.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.320]   And I had the idea that you could, this was before smartphones, right?
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.120]   So you could call in on your basic route that you had already registered and say how long
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.720]   it took you and you get value back.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.960]   Well, imagine this in Google now, right?
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.680]   This is, Google now does a little of this already.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.920]   It knows where you typically go.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.640]   So it'll tell me, oh, it's the usual time you drive up to school.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.240]   Here's what it's going to take and there's what the traffic is.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   These are the reports.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.120]   So I can show you, you know, these are people who, these are Wazers who wave their hand
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.960]   across the phone or tap it with three fingers and then dictate things like moderate traffic.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.120]   Some of this is from the average speed is just automatically collected.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.400]   But here's north of here, seven miles away, there's a police officer hidden.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.640]   Some of them are visible, some of them are invisible, invisible, heavy traffic, complete
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.840]   standstill, vehicle stopped on shoulder.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.320]   These are very valuable.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.920]   Pot hole on road.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.800]   Sometimes they'll be road debris or roadkill and then it'll let you know.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.280]   And I think that's all very handy and has actually saved me.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.480]   And then of course, because it knows where traffic is stopped, it will reroute you very
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.480]   effectively.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.360]   Now here's my question to Leon.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.160]   Now that it's going to go into Google and let's assume that the usage of it just explodes,
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.080]   then does every person using Waze go to the same alternate route and the alternate route
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.080]   becomes worse than the route.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.560]   It is better to not not share, isn't it?
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.560]   Yeah, it is.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.120]   And so I didn't think of that.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.840]   I never really used Waze because Android navigation was always so great.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.880]   But do you think that it got as many users as it got because Apple like for so long didn't
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880]   have no navigation?
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.880]   Do you feel like it was the it was like the nav app for Apple for iPhone, you know, before
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.120]   Apple launched there?
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.560]   Yeah, 50 million users they claim and it was the number one mapping app after the Apple
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.560]   map fiasco.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.680]   So for sure, it gained some users then, but it was already quite successful.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.080]   Already a cult occult.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.400]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.520]   I started using it long before then.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.120]   I look forward to it being integrated into Google.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.360]   So I agree that they should retain autonomy as a company and so forth and so on and maybe
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.440]   even a standalone app.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.200]   I think some people would prefer that.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.120]   But why not get that data into into Google Maps and Google navigation?
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.560]   That would be really fast.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.360]   Both both better maps and your user data that Google now will know where you go shopping
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   all the time.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.400]   It'll know all your routes that you take.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.840]   Apple announced, you know, at the WWDC that many, many car companies were going to start
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.000]   incorporating Siri and Apple maps into the car so that Apple maps would actually show
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.120]   up on the screen.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.680]   And I just don't know if that's such a good idea.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   Do not want.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:01.360]   Do not want my next car, which is an Audi has Google for a fee, by the way, Google Earth.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.840]   The fee is because you have to have connectivity in its maps.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.560]   And actually one of our interns dad has it and he says, don't get it.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.680]   It's very distracting because it's so pretty.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.680]   Look at that.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.680]   Look where I am.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.680]   So but if you could incorporate ways into an in car system.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.680]   Yaw.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.680]   Killer.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.680]   Killer.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.760]   So right now you have the app running and open running on your phone in order to know like,
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.960]   Oh, hey, there's a cop.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.840]   Which means you really need a dashboard mount and you need a, you know, a plug in and all
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.840]   that stuff.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.840]   Right.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.880]   I don't want a car that's going to be amplified.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.880]   I want an app.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.040]   I want an Android car.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.480]   And you know, if a brand goes only to Apple honest to God, that's the reason for me not
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.840]   to buy it now because I'm kind of a green invested in Android.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.960]   Somebody says in our chairman, I don't know if this is a choice.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.680]   She, she, because she's all about Android.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680]   She has to have an Android.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.680]   Right.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.600]   She can't buy an Apple car.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.400]   Somebody said the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee has ways.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.200]   I didn't, I don't know if that's the case.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   That's the main.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.120]   It's not a better car.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.200]   I think, I think you're right.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.320]   I don't want Apple maps.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.320]   Please.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.200]   I beg of you.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.320]   So I'd love to see and it's Google did not mention anything at Google.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.760]   I would have loved to see Google say, well, you got Ferrari, but we got Lamborghini.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.040]   You got Chevrolet, but we've got Ford.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:34.600]   Actually, Ford is the one stand out there using Microsoft's voice recognition and nuance.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.320]   So you know, Apple doesn't even own its voice recognition.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.600]   Google is the only company I know of that owns its voice recognition.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   Apple's using nuance.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   Hmm.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   Hmm.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.120]   So this is about a data source for you guys.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.560]   Well, there was the theory was, and I forgot who said this, maybe it was Renee Richie on
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.080]   Mac Break Weekly, that perhaps goo, you know, turn by turn might have been a service that
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.080]   Google was licensing.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.080]   We don't know.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.560]   Maybe they got it from Telenav or Navtech.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.280]   And perhaps that contract was up and Google said, boy, we'd like to have our own turn by
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.280]   turn.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.920]   Perhaps that was the reason for the acquisition.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   That makes sense.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.920]   Doesn't that kind of make sense?
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   I don't know.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.400]   I think that's part of it's data sources.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.600]   I think Chita, right?
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   One is the maps.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.920]   Two is the turn by turn.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.160]   Three is the consumer data.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.480]   Where do you go every day?
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.440]   It was John C. de Vorek said that credit to John for that.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.440]   And he got paranoid about how Google was going to misuse this and use it to spy on all of
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.440]   us.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.440]   Oh, my God.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.680]   Now, let me, okay.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.520]   We did a great, and I highly recommend this.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.760]   Steve Gibson's security now today, which will be available at twit.tv/sn on iTunes.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.600]   It probably in a few hours.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.560]   We'll have a text transcription tomorrow.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.120]   And I would actually send that to your member of Congress.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.800]   Steve has put together all the pieces of prism and thinks he has figured out what exactly
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.200]   is going on.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.840]   And I have to say his scenario fits perfectly with all the data points we have.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.880]   It's conjecture because, you know, for one thing, the Patriot Act and NSL National Security
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.280]   Letters prevent people from saying what's going on.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.640]   Actually, Steve's being arrested as we speak.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.680]   Well, and Steve's based thing this on the known leak, the known whistleblower from the NSA
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.160]   and AT&T six years ago, seven years ago, and how they were doing it.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.440]   And what he's done is he's extrapolated that into the present.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.760]   What would happen six years later?
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.760]   What would the NSA be doing?
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.400]   And it does fit all the data, every single data point we have.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.560]   And the only reason people have it.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:43.040]   The greatest part of the show to me was at the end when Steve of all people said, well,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.640]   if the NSA asked me to design this, this is what I do.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.640]   And it's a little bit technical.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:55.040]   So it's the kind of thing that you're probably not going to see mainstream media explain.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   Oh, God, no, they'll screw it up.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:03.840]   So the basic, the gist of this is no, the NSA doesn't in fact need to have access to
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.200]   Google servers, which Google, Facebook and everybody else have said, no, they don't have
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.840]   access to our servers.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.240]   They tap in upstream.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.640]   In fact, they tap in right at the point where Google would connect to the internet backbone,
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.800]   where they would get their internet service.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.440]   You don't even need to let Google know you're doing that.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:25.760]   You could do it with NSL's to and this is what AT&T was giving the NSA.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.920]   AT&T in 2006, whistleblower revealed had a secret room in its headquarters in San Francisco
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:38.120]   where all world net, which was AT&T's service internet service traffic was being collected
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.120]   by the NSA just split it off.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.000]   It took and the reason he says it's called prism is because this is fiber optic cable,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.960]   which they have split just as a prism splits light into a room where we collect it all.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.880]   And his thesis and I think is probably accurate, although we may never know because that nobody's
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.760]   telling the truth in this or at least nobody's revealing what they know in this is that they
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.640]   basically collecting everything, storing it.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.520]   And then if a time comes, they want to know, well, what was, you know, bad guy a up to
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.320]   last year, they've got all the data.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.600]   That's why they're building a giant seven set up by election facility.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.360]   But the slide had two parts, right?
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.360]   Prism was the lower part of that slide.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.240]   But the other part of the slide talked about tapping straight into communications.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.240]   Right.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.240]   And so there were a separate thing.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.240]   But there, but yes, and what prism is is, and he also explained why you would want to
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.680]   do it right at the juncture of Google and the public internet because you can then say
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.200]   this came, we know this came through Google and then you can subpoena or NSL Google and
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.960]   say who was that.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.400]   So, so they need to know where it came from.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.080]   They could, you know, I said, why don't you just tap it upstream, get the backbones.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.080]   That's all you need because you can't tell where it came from.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.160]   So if you can say, Hey, this, this was Google, we can subpoena Google.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.320]   This was Facebook, a problem.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.120]   We know how to get that information out of Facebook and then put the puzzle together.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.800]   He theorizes this because in that previous testimony, as I understand, the hour, right,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:07.600]   that there was a secret room built at a Folsom street facility, right, where you knew where
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.600]   it was going next.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.400]   And thus, that's where the theory comes from.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   Exactly.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.400]   It's more.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.600]   Yeah, I mean, that and that's known.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.640]   That was exactly what the NSA was doing with AT&T, the AT&T whistleblower.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.160]   That's that's fairly well exposed.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.120]   So it makes perfect sense.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.120]   Okay.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   Some questions.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.120]   Sorry.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:31.720]   So this means that they're capturing the bits going out of all of Google's data centers
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.720]   across the world.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.520]   They've they've well, not across the world in the US, probably.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.520]   Okay.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.760]   So all of Google's data centers, even in the US, they're splitting off.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.440]   So they're getting the bits coming out of it.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.080]   They're getting the raw bits coming out of Google servers and they're collecting all
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.080]   of them.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.920]   And they're able to assemble them into something coherent enough to target individuals.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.520]   I mean, of course, that's possible.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.920]   I just don't have that much.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.520]   It's a big data.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.320]   It was big data, right.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.880]   And we're getting better and better at that.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.520]   I think that in 2006, that they were looking for specific things.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.200]   They weren't collecting everything.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.040]   So we know that the NSA is building a giant million and a half square foot facility in
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.720]   Utah with storage capacity of seven zettabytes.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.200]   It's just a job of reassembling those bits into something that's usable.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.600]   Here's my theory.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.600]   Here's my theory.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.080]   And this goes back to the.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.240]   Well, the bits are assembled.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.240]   Don't think.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.400]   I mean, there's an email.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.520]   There's, you know, there's a conversation.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.040]   It's not like they're completely random.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.760]   They're assembled and that they're linear, right?
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.760]   There's some.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.720]   So if you could search it for you can do a search for an IP address.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.600]   If you could do a search, I think we know.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600]   The words.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   I think we know how to do this.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   I think this data big.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   This is just big data.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.280]   Well, I think Gina, what also is happening is that is that this is the reason that they
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.600]   have the previously warrantless wire tapping, I think, just guessing to.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.440]   And also the Verizon data is they're looking for anomalies to patterns.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.440]   Yes, exactly.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.440]   Exactly.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   Exactly.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.440]   We know what people are the pattern.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.360]   They want to see anomalies where things are happening oddly.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.200]   And you're right, Leo, if you go to an audit address, if you go to a word or a sequence
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.040]   of words they're looking for, and then they can back up to track that down.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.240]   They're not trying to reassemble the entire internet conversation.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.240]   They don't need to.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.240]   But they want to save it.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.920]   They want to save it so that they could go back.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.920]   They're gripping the stream.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.920]   They're capping the stream.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.960]   They're gripping the most primitive way they're gripping it.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.680]   But I think they're doing more, you know, for instance, you know, your bank will let
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.160]   you know if suspicious activity is going on in your credit card, right?
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.280]   Well, in order for that to happen, there is a third party service provider, very big
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.360]   third party service provider that gets all the transactions and looks for anomalies,
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.680]   looks for certain patterns.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.320]   That's a lot of data.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.560]   Data by the way, which I'm sure is also being collected by the NSA.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.360]   And they can see in that stream, they can see anomalies and patterns.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.880]   That's just, you know that.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.760]   That's just big, that's just big iron.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.760]   Okay.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.440]   That's how you get that call that says, hey, you know, we just saw some weird stuff.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.680]   Did you just buy sneakers and three gallons of gas?
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.360]   And that's because they can do pattern recognition and this stuff.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.520]   And believe me, credit monitoring all the credit card transactions going on in the US.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.400]   I once knew the number.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   It's a large number.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.200]   It's many, many bites.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.000]   I guess I guess I was thinking that there'd be, I mean, that's structured data, you know,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.040]   where they have triggers and queries constantly running and monitoring, but just getting the
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.360]   stream of bits come across the wire, right?
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:30.280]   This is comparable to what Google was accidentally capturing with the street view cars, right?
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.680]   When they were accidentally capturing the data that was going across the wireless networks,
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.680]   right?
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   Which was, we all agreed was basically gobbled.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.680]   You go up, right?
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.400]   Well, those were random packets.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   This is not random packets.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.400]   This is the whole thing.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.400]   This is the whole thing.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.440]   They're capturing the whole thing.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.320]   And I know no one knows what they're doing with it, but I think Steve's supposition is
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.760]   probably accurate that they're just collecting it.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.960]   They may do some data analysis on it.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.080]   But the other reason that they want to just have it is so that at a later date, should
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.080]   they begin an investigation, they can pull into threads.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.800]   But I saw one reference Leo to somebody doing a calculation of what it would take to store
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.960]   all that and the cost of that is pretty tremendous.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   Well, IBM has a page called Big Data in which they say we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.080]   data a day.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.480]   There goes another number of the week.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.480]   Was that?
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.480]   No.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.480]   That would be a good one.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:34.120]   90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone, according
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.200]   to IBM.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.120]   That's everything.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.040]   That's post to social media, climate sensors.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.480]   That's purchase records, GPS signals.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.080]   And IBM says we can analyze this.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.440]   12 terabytes of tweets a day.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.560]   350 billion annual meter readings.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.720]   This is what IBM specializes in.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:04.720]   In fact, one of the things I read said that Watson has been repurposed to do exactly this.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.240]   Watson has been turned.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.040]   Watson which won Jeopardy, right?
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   Right.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   Right.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.040]   Watson has been turned.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.920]   Watson was doing to win Jeopardy.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.360]   So I don't think any of that.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:22.240]   In fact, there really shouldn't be a surprise because there's been this move in this direction.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.160]   Well, a quick question, Leo.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:34.440]   If I encrypt my queries on a browser, is that of any use to say that?
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:39.920]   So yeah, so while they could be doing a man in the middle attack, that we're not pursuing
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.920]   that.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.960]   And that would be an awfully a lot of work to do for all of these transactions.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.600]   So encrypted data, SSL data and so forth is probably okay.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.560]   But Steve points out all your email is unencrypted.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.720]   Otherwise, people wouldn't be able to read it.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   Oh, that's true.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   But isn't this part of the reason that you think looking back now when Google decided,
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.560]   okay, it's time to go ahead and go to HTTPS and encrypt more stuff.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.560]   Right.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.560]   You almost wonder where they thought.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.440]   You know, we can't say anything, but folks, you really ought to do this.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   Well, there were other reasons.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.400]   Yeah, but I think that might be one of the reasons.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.920]   And you know, for years, I use PGP.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.400]   I would sign on my email with PGP and encourage people to encrypt the email back to me.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.600]   I mean, literally for 10 years, my thesis was, look, if everybody, even innocent parties
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.840]   encrypt email, then encryption itself wouldn't be seen as a sign of guilt.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   Right.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.560]   So so we should all routinely encrypt.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.760]   Maybe now people will take that more seriously.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.640]   Glenn Greenwald, when he quoted Edward Snowden, Snowden said they can literally watch your ideas
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:41.720]   form as you type, and that would be the case, not even if without access to Google servers,
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.320]   as long as they're, you know, at the access point to the public internet.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.120]   The funny thing too about, well, is that Snowden wanted to contact Greenwald and wanted to
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.160]   do a key exchange.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.160]   Right.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.480]   Greenwald had no idea how to do it.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.800]   Snowden made a video to connect to me.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   He still didn't do it.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.080]   It was only when the video maker came to him and said, listen, you're really on a bad
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:07.080]   engine of this.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.080]   And so somebody made fun of them on Twitter and he said, no, I've learned now.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.080]   I know I learned my lesson.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.080]   New York.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.080]   This is from the New York Times.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.760]   IBM's Watson, the super computing technology, the New York Times wrote this, that defeated
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.240]   human jeopardy champions in 2011 as a prime example of the power of data intensive artificial
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.240]   intelligence.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.160]   Watson's style computing analyst said is precisely the technology that would make the ambitious
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.320]   data collection program of the NSA seem practical.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.760]   Researchers could instantly sift through the massive internet communications data, see
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.160]   patterns of suspicious online behavior and thus narrow the hunt for terrorists.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:45.520]   Both the NSA and the CIA have been testing Watson in the last two years, said a consultant
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.960]   who has advised the government and asked not to be identified.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.040]   I think now we know it's Snowden.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.480]   So they've been, they've actually used Watson directly for this.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.720]   So does that answer your question, Gina?
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.200]   I realize it was kind of a dumb question.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.040]   This is where we've been headed.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.520]   And it looks like this is, this is what Eddish had study in school.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.800]   It looks like it's not going to go away.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   What do you do?
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   What do you think?
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.360]   Should we all routinely encrypt our emails?
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.600]   And it's easy to do, by the way, it's trivial.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.360]   PGP is trivial.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:25.680]   PGP or, you know, certificate based encryption or GNU privacy guard, which is the open source.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.720]   I think that the providers should do it for us.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   I agree.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.920]   I think Gmail could launch that right now and everybody would turn it on.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.920]   Yep.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:40.200]   The problem with that, no, I guess you could do that as long as it was Gmail to Gmail.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.440]   Oh, oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.640]   If I'm sending to Yahoo mail from Gmail, unless Yahoo and Gmail make a deal, I mean, I've used
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   Hushmail.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.640]   Now the other part of this, of course, is analysis of patterns.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.080]   And this was, you know, one of the defenses the government, including President Obama,
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.240]   had was, well, we're not listening to your conversations.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.040]   We're just monitoring who you call and when.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.560]   And that's another part of this is they maybe don't even need to see in the email if they
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.000]   could see the patterns of communication.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.760]   There's a lot there that you can get.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760]   And again, they see it in a couple of ways.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.240]   Then what they say, oh, this person is starting to communicate with this person, right?
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.800]   That's the more obvious, but the less obvious is the search for anomalies.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.960]   Well, don't you remember in Zero Dark Thirty, how we caught Obama?
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:28.080]   I mean, Obama, Osama bin Laden, you know, it was watching how communication went in and
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   out of that compound and finding the career.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.760]   These are, they didn't even see what the communications were.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.320]   They didn't need to.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.480]   They were able to backtrack from who was talking to whom.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:46.600]   And of course, this argument that Snowden has blown the lid off how it works.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.920]   Osama bin Laden wasn't trust in an email anyway.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.200]   He was using human courage.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.880]   Human courage, right.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.600]   And we still, and they were still able to track them.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.360]   By the way, somebody in a chat room just pointed out, Gina, you wrote an article on
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.760]   Life Hacker in 2006, how to encrypt your email.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.760]   You knew.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.760]   That was so 2006 ago.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   I did.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:09.440]   I did write a post about how to actually, did I write this?
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.920]   No, I think, no, no, I edited this.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.920]   It's an old article.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.920]   It shows me as the author.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   It was actually Jason Thomas wrote it.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.240]   You could see his, his byline at the bottom.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.560]   I did publish that email.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:25.440]   I always sort of aspired to and fantasized about using PGP every day, and I never quite
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.440]   got around to it.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.320]   I signed my email from, you know, every, all my email was signed for two reasons.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.760]   One, to prove that it was for me because the signature was my key, my public key, but also
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.800]   to give people the opportunity to encrypt email back.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.760]   And I only received a handful of encrypted emails from people.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.400]   You have to exchange keys if you want to have a encrypted conversation.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.200]   That's why Snowden was trying to tell Greenwald, "Hey, give me your tea.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.240]   You got to do this thing so I can talk to you."
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:57.240]   And of course, like most people, Glenn Greenwald had no idea what he was talking about.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:02.520]   In Microsoft products and Thunderbird and others, you can use a certificate, much like
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.880]   the SSL certificates, even a self-signed certificate.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   And there's a big mail.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:13.160]   There's a lot of, there's a lot of good choices out there for doing this.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.880]   I wonder, you know, the polls show that most Americans say, "Hey, you know, you have to
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:23.280]   give up a little privacy to fight terrorism to keep us safe."
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:30.080]   I think that could change based on further revelations and on enough people in Congress
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.080]   getting mad.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.080]   But Congress is so wacky.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.120]   I mean, Peter King is saying, "Arrest like Greenwald for nothing to leave."
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.120]   Right.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.120]   Nobody can agree on what this is.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.920]   No, no, no, all it's amazing to split suit.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.080]   You have Glenn Beck agreeing with liberals.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.080]   It's a wacky world.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   No.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.840]   Yeah, I saw somebody.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.080]   I mean, it's just, yeah.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.200]   And it's also, as I mentioned on Sunday on Twitter, a litmus test for where your politics
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.160]   lie, how you react to this.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.760]   Well, it is and it isn't because, again, it's people from left and right can be on either
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.760]   side here.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.840]   My argument is that the discussion needs to rise up again to the level of principles.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:11.120]   That the principle that our physical mail is private and can only be opened by government
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.280]   with a warrant.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.360]   We should hold with all of our other private communications by any means whatsoever.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.000]   And that principle isn't there.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.400]   There should be a principle of government being transparent except what it needs not
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.400]   to be.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.120]   And there are by God, a lot of instances when it needs to be secret.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.280]   I buy that.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.160]   But we're not having the discussion at the level of principles and we're having, you
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.760]   know, all bunch of exceptions around rules.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.520]   And that leads to mistrust because when you don't know what's going on, you're going
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.520]   to default to mistrust.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.520]   Right.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:47.800]   Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, but I'm glad that we're starting to understand
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.040]   it and talk about it.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.480]   Yes, I'm too.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:59.080]   So does this, I'm curious, Jeff, does prison make you think twice about living on a Chromebook?
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:06.920]   No, and I'll get in trouble for saying this, but this is the Eric Schmidt rule, you know,
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.480]   one of my ashamed of doing.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.480]   Uh-huh.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.920]   I already am cautious.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   Everyone I know is anxious.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.520]   Can I just point out that the Jager Hoover's spied on Martin Luther King and collected a
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.520]   fairly large FBI dossier on a...
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.400]   I'm not one spying on this one.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.560]   Well, I'm just saying that the government can decide who it's, who doesn't like.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.440]   Yes, and it can do that anyway.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.040]   And you may say I'm not doing anything wrong.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.080]   I don't think Martin Luther King, it was doing anything wrong.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.880]   No, but the question is, does the cloud make that necessarily any more different?
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.880]   My behavior will be...
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.880]   Just makes it easier.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   I wasn't going to send an email.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.880]   Right.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.880]   I mean, the rule is very simple.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.320]   Don't send an email to anyone if you're afraid of it getting passed on to anyone.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320]   Period.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   Right.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.320]   Well, anything...
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.560]   I guess at this point we have to assume anything we do on the internet is public.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:07.280]   I know, I'm not willing to go that far because we have to be careful here of...
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.280]   Google might be...
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.280]   I mean, the government might be getting that traffic by, but they're not recreating the
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.600]   entire internet and seeing everything we do.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.280]   And they're not posting it online, they're keeping it to themselves.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.920]   And the most important thing I think is the worst part of this entire story from our
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.800]   perspective, the technology perspective, was the Washington Post screwing up and presuming
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:33.600]   that there were direct ties into Google, Facebook, at all servers so the government
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.720]   could make queries whenever they wanted.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.040]   Simply not true, it took like two days of vehement denial from the company.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.640]   Well, but now you understand what the confusion was.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.880]   It was more an issue of understanding how technology works than it was inaccurate.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:51.360]   And this was Snowden's assertion is they can watch what you're doing as you're typing.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.600]   Well, he wasn't asserting anything.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.800]   The PowerPoint said something.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.480]   Yeah, and it's not untrue.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   Both are true.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.720]   In Steve's presumption, I agree with that.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.040]   But the point is, back to Gina's question, back to your assumption that there's no such
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.280]   thing as private.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.280]   The odds that the government could possibly care about recreating any single email of
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.160]   mine are next to nil.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.360]   But if they wanted to build a case against you at any point...
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.800]   Well, they could do that anyway.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:28.320]   The issue here is not the technology.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.160]   The issue here is the Fiza Court being secret and members of Congress being gagged.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.320]   The issue here is the oversight of government and a lack of transparency.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.240]   This is what I'm worried about with all this.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.240]   It's that once again, technology gets to be made into the boogeyman here when in fact
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.240]   it's government.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.240]   I've said often on the show...
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240]   Oh, I agree.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.280]   The government fancies itself, the protector of our privacy, it is the worst enemy of privacy.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.000]   It is government we have to be careful about.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   I don't say this libertarian.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.760]   I'm a Hillary Clinton Democrat, folks.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.920]   Let's make this clear.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.400]   I emphasize this really, really strongly.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.800]   But what's happening in the discussion is, "Uh-oh, technology is bad, internet is bad
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.880]   for you, Google is bad."
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:09.200]   And so what we're seeing and also in other countries, they're saying quite properly enraged,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.040]   "Oh, they don't care about spying on us.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.920]   They just care about spying on the US," which of course is where the law hinges.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:21.520]   What happens now is you have European officials coming after and saying that they were already
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.640]   after the idea and Canadian officials too, that data stored in the US was in danger of
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.640]   going to the government.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.920]   Well, that affects Google, that affects Facebook, that affects the internet, that affects the
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.480]   industry that we're trying to build on, and that affects our country and things like jobs.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:41.120]   So there's an ongoing damage that I don't think has been covered as a story yet to the
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.120]   net.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:48.040]   Well, Steve referred to this, our European allies are very upset about this.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:54.080]   The Prime Minister of Finland said this is probably a violation of Finnish law.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:32:01.400]   They're going to go to our friend, Nili Cruz, who is one of the commissioners of the EU and
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:06.560]   the woman who's been very actively pursuing Google and others for privacy.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.560]   She would be the attack dog in something like this.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.360]   He's damaging to our relationships in the rest of the world.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.080]   Terrible, just terrible.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.520]   And I think that's not been calculated.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.480]   I haven't seen anyone do that story yet.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.160]   And as always, I'm in the position of defending the internet and defending Google and I'll
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.120]   get in trouble for that, but whatever.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.280]   Well, as it turns out, Google is probably, given Steve's explanation, which just makes
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:36.240]   such sense, Google's not lying when they say, "No, they don't have access to our servers,"
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.240]   nor is Facebook.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.760]   And Google's not lying when they say, "No, we don't have a secret drop box for them."
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.160]   It doesn't matter.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.560]   All they have to do is tap Google.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.760]   They're wiretapping Google and getting all of it.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.760]   Get it wired to write.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.760]   Get it?
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.760]   Yep.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   Yep.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.920]   So, Jeff, I'm going to be releasing super provocative here.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:59.640]   So you're okay with the idea that anything you send their share to Google or anytime you
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.080]   use a Google service that you're in essence sharing that information at the NSA as well.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.080]   No, I'm not.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.520]   I'm disagreeing with Leo that I should assume that it is shared.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:16.120]   What I'm saying is I'm already careful because of human beings about what I send on the internet.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.000]   Whenever I write an email, the rule is, if you write an email, you better be comfortable
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.360]   with it being on page one of the New York Times and didn't portray us learning.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.360]   That's right.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.360]   Yep.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.960]   So, that was already my rule.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.560]   Now, I'm sure I do stupid things and I'm sure there's plenty of things that I do that
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.840]   would embarrass me just because I'm being dumb.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.200]   But that's already my rule of care and it's not because of the technology.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   It's not because of government.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.880]   It's because of other humans could hit CCL.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.880]   Yes.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.840]   So, that's all I'm saying to you.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.960]   No, no, I don't believe privacy is dead.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.160]   B, I value privacy.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.600]   So C, I'm not saying that I'm already given up on my privacy.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.280]   I'm just saying that I had already set my rules of care here.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.800]   Now those are rules we have to give all of our children.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.560]   It also weakens our argument with countries like China when we say, "Hey, you guys stop
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.560]   hacking us."
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.920]   Well, that's the next thing we came out today from Snowden, Leo.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:19.000]   In Snowden said there were 61,000 hacking operations right now from the US.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   There's cyber attacks going on from the US, not only to the outside world, but he even
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.200]   said to you inside the US.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   That's nice.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.760]   Yeah, countries we're not at war at war with, right?
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.880]   Get a CS degree for the government.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.520]   Once again, we should be a nation of principles.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.640]   That's supposedly what we're running on as principles and that's what we can harken
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.520]   to, but we can't harken to them when what we do on the basis of those or in violation
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.960]   of those is secret.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.960]   Well said.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.680]   We're going to take a break.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.680]   We will talk.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.040]   Hashbooks come to Facebook.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:01.640]   WWDC gene has some thoughts about the new iOS 7 and other stuff.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.680]   Are you going to buy that new Mac Pro, the Darth Vader Mac Pro?
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.400]   Oh man, that was the part of the keynote that I was like, "No, that looks amazing."
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.480]   I'm excited about the errors too.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.480]   I think I'm going to get an error.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.120]   I already bought an error, but I haven't had an error.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.680]   That Mac Pro was like, "It's pretty, but I've got a developer or somebody who is a pro
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.680]   user.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   I'd be a little reluctant to purchase it.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   We'll talk about that."
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.800]   Ooh, yeah, I want to talk about that.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   Good place for your cat to sleep though.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.800]   A funny war.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.480]   A nice warm spot right at the top there.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.640]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:41.160]   LegalZoom's not a law firm helps you get your business done, your business done, personal
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:45.800]   and public.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.120]   LegalZoom.com, go visit and you can see what they can do.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:54.120]   For instance, as I did when I first started Twitter, which is me, I didn't even have any
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:36:01.720]   employees, but I knew I needed to protect myself with at least an LLC at $99, plus the
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.760]   state filing fee at LegalZoom.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.280]   You don't need a lawyer to do it.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.720]   I have to say it was very straightforward.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.320]   You go through the questionnaire, had no trouble doing it.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.280]   In fact, we're still running on that LLC.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.320]   In corporation, you want to do an S or a C Corp, $99.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.320]   Trademark.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.320]   This is a good one.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.600]   If you've got a blog or a YouTube channel, maybe you want to think about trademarking
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:28.680]   that name, that persona, that logo, otherwise you got no protection and $169.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.680]   That's easy.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.680]   You could do it right now.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.560]   You'll be done by the end of the day.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.240]   If you've got a family, you really ought to have a last will.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.720]   Otherwise, the courts determine where your assets and where your kids go.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.720]   Here's a nice thing.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.560]   LegalZoom, while you can do all of it yourself, if you feel like, "I'd love to ask an attorney
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.560]   a question."
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:53.040]   They have the legal plan, which allows you to ask questions of an attorney in your state,
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.840]   somebody who's been vetted, their profiles online, and unedited review.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.080]   You can see if this person's right for you.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   LegalZoom is just fabulous.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   I want you to try it.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:10.440]   There are so many ways that you can do DBAs, entity name availability check, entity name,
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:17.680]   under the reservation, trademark search, corporate supplies, registered agent services, state
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.200]   tax, federal tax IDs, 501(c)(3) application.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.520]   You want to set up a nonprofit LegalZoom can help you with that.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.440]   Business licenses, sellers, permits, on and on and on.

[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.960]   Day before yesterday, Monday was Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.920]   The Dean is a developer, develops for iOS.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.760]   You didn't try to get tickets, I presume.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.760]   Waffley, hard.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.760]   No, I didn't even try.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.760]   These developer--
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.760]   There's like 70 seconds.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.760]   They go so fast.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.760]   Yeah, I'm not a pressless.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:24.240]   Like Google, where there were so many people who wanted to go, they streamed the keynote
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.560]   and they're streaming a lot of the sessions.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:31.000]   If you're a registered Apple developer, you can get those on the WWDC app.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.280]   So they're being pretty public about all that information.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.240]   We can't report on it because if you have an NDA, you can't talk about it.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:44.200]   I'm not an NDA developer, so I don't know what they're saying because I can't see it.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.560]   But we were all able to see the keynote address.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:57.080]   New MacBook Airs, no new Retina, surprisingly, no new iMacs, only new MacBook Airs.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:02.680]   And based on the Haswell chipset, so you get nine hours of battery life on the 11-inch,
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:07.200]   12 hours of battery life on the 13-inch WOW.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.120]   And a new Mac Pro that's coming sometime later this year made in the US of A, assembled in
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   the USA.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   That's nice.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.680]   Yeah, it's an amazing process.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:21.160]   It's extruded aluminum that's then anodized to look black.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.480]   It will be a beautiful thing, but you know, you can't upgrade anything in it, except the
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   ram, I guess.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:34.000]   And the GPU, the graphics processors, two of them, AMD graphics processors, soldered onto
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.560]   the motherboard.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.800]   Ah, Steve lives.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.360]   Yeah, so this is why you wouldn't buy this.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.200]   Well, it will look beautiful if that's all you need.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   Right, ever.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:50.200]   But if you're going to have anything else, you've got to buy expensive cables, lightning,
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.440]   you know, Thunderbolt 2 cables, plus external stuff, you're going to have all this stuff
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.960]   hanging off of this beautiful thing, it's going to look worse.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.760]   It's going to look like an octopus.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.720]   But if you can get by, you know, I'm thinking it's going to be a great alternative to the
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.880]   Mac mini if you've got $5,000, $6,000 to burn.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.400]   Yeah, do we know what the price is going to be?
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.560]   We don't have an idea yet.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.560]   But I can pretty much guarantee you we're in the $4,000 to $6,000 range.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.640]   I mean, there's no way.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.920]   It will drive up to four 4k monitors.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:26.560]   If you had a little money left over, you want to spend a couple of three, only three, only
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.040]   three, sorry, only three 4k monitors.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.040]   Pardon me?
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.480]   Yeah, I was going to say because if you did cinema displays, throw those in.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   Yeah, have a couple of cinema displays.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.920]   This is not for somebody who doesn't have the money.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.320]   This is for somebody who gets their boss to pay is who this is for.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.320]   It's pretty.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.320]   I was wow.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.400]   I mean, I think the design is really cool.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.800]   I actually kind of liked, I forget when it was day in the presenter who said, you know,
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   can't innovate my ass.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   I thought that was kind of funny.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   I was feel shiller.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   I feel shiller.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   I thought that was funny.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   I love to see new Apple designs.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.280]   It's a really beautiful design.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.680]   It reminds me a lot of the cube which I bought.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.520]   I just, I just, I don't think it's, I don't think it's going to do very well.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.520]   I've never had a back pro.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.840]   I might do a Hackintosh at some point or even that.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.240]   That's what's going to happen.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.920]   That's a little bit of work because things break.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.720]   And it's unreliable and maybe if it's your production machine, you don't want to have
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.720]   a Hackintosh.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.720]   But yeah.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:34.200]   Why, why would the, how big is the business for them to keep in those tiny?
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.200]   No, it's tiny.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.160]   But it's, but it's important for a few reasons.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.600]   One, a lot of people in Apple are pro users, right?
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.480]   So that they can't just dump that.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.480]   What are they?
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.720]   Shortly, oh, this is Apple's prism.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.240]   I mean, I mean, um, pixel.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.240]   Pixel.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.240]   One of them be words.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.240]   Not their prism.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.240]   It is.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.240]   It's a pixel in some ways.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.240]   I think you're right.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.240]   That's an interesting analogy.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.240]   And, and.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.240]   Except that has more than a browser on it.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   Right.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.240]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.240]   Sorry, sorry.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.240]   You're a real whale.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.720]   Hey, but if you're a video editor, you're going to have to buy expensive new thunderbolt
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.120]   arrays, thunderbolt cables.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.880]   The car, I mean, it's just, it's just not cheap.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.200]   There's no way this is going to be.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   You're going to end up spending 10 grand for a system.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.200]   That's beautiful.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.720]   That's not lusted after a desktop machine in 10 years.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.720]   I know that was a thing, right?
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.680]   They maybe want to desktop the first time in a long time.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   I'm going to get the air.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.320]   I'm not going to get a macro, but, uh, but yeah, I was like, wow, that's a good looking,
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.680]   good looking little iOS seven.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   Lot of controversy.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.280]   Joshua Topolsky said it was childish, ugly.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:43.040]   Um, there's a lot of energy put into translucency.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:49.640]   Um, boy, it's very Android like, I mean, you even have a dedicated flashlight button.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.640]   Yeah, it's up too, too bad for all those flashlight apps.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.360]   We talked about this a little bit on, uh, on all about Android last night.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.800]   There's a little bit of arrow, like windows arrow going on with the, with the blur and
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   the transparency.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:08.240]   By the way, I asked Renee Richie, who's developer, and that is, uh, real time.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.240]   And you can see it.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:14.600]   Look at it, uh, the effects are real time, but based on what's underneath when you slide
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:20.560]   up or slide down the notification panel, that real time translucency, that's a lot of work.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.560]   Oh, hey.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.400]   And there it is, the flashlight icon.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.800]   But look at those icons.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.600]   Just let's go down and go back a little bit to the chat.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.640]   If you will, I know that's a video on Apple site.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.560]   There's Johnny I've had it is slide to unlock.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.320]   And I have to tell you that, by the way.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.360]   Yeah, but it's slide up now, which is, okay, go get it.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.560]   So look at those icons at the bottom there.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.560]   Flashlights.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.560]   Um, clock.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.560]   Yeah, well good.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.560]   Yeah, that's what that is.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.560]   That's a clock.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.840]   Clock calculator and camera.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.840]   Yeah, very good.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.840]   Nicely done.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.000]   And actually that looks different than what's on my phone right now.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.920]   So they've actually changed it or it's possible.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.120]   Oh, I just don't have an air drop and airplay and I have enabled.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.880]   Yeah, airdrop is for a contact only.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.520]   As you can see, I've been listening to, uh, get lucky from daft punk.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.800]   Actually on this phone, can you show my phone?
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:16.160]   I'm listening to, that's my bitch Kanye West and Jay Z.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:20.480]   Hey, I don't know whose phone this is, but I'm giving it back quick.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.600]   This is very Android like these buttons up a top airplane mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, do
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:29.240]   not disturb and rotation lock.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.240]   I don't know.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:34.000]   Yeah, but you know, this is, this is, um, so I think they actually did this.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   This is blast for me.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.880]   I know, but I think they did the control center a little bit better than Android has done
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.280]   with the quick toggle shade.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:44.640]   It's pretty because it's pretty well, you know, the, the, the, the transparency eye
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.760]   candy, but there's also just fewer taps.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.960]   So like the brightness slider, for example, on Android, you'd have to tap brightness and
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.240]   then you get the slider.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.840]   The slider's right there here in the control center.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.800]   And I really like that you have to, that you swipe up.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.360]   So it's one motion, whereas on, on Android and jelly bean, you swipe down and you have
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.920]   to, you have to tap the button to flip, flip the notification shade around to get to the
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.040]   quick toggle, you know, because Google now is the swipe up.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.920]   Now I should point out that that, that's because you're using vanilla Android.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.880]   Here it is on the Samsung where you have the brightness, uh, right there.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.240]   In fact, this very much looks like this looks almost identical to touch whiz.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.240]   Oh, good.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.240]   Right.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.280]   Well, you know, it's funny, like I was thinking about how there was such a strong emotional
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.120]   response to the iOS 7 redesign.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   People either love it or they hated it.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.040]   And I was thinking about how, you know, Android, such a chameleon, right?
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.960]   Like it, it looks different depending on what kind of phone you have, what skin you're running
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.200]   and what widgets you've got.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.600]   There is no Android look, right?
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.720]   There is no unified Android look, right?
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.240]   But there is a unified iOS look and people are very, very attached to it and people flip
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.120]   out when, when things change.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:49.680]   So I think, you know, folks really responded, um, emotionally about this, which is really
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.920]   a testament to the product.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:54.560]   People love, you know, people love iOS and you just wouldn't quite get that, that reaction
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.560]   with Android.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   So yeah, it's true.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.560]   I have to say the Apple fan boy.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   What are the other?
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:59.560]   Oh, well, yeah.
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.600]   Well, listen, there's, there's Android fanboys too.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:06.160]   You know, I, I felt like the people in the crowd I run around with is on Google+ and stuff.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.400]   They're mostly Android users.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.160]   And I heard a lot of people saying, oh, they're just ripping off Android.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.320]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.040]   I mean, I think, and I was saying this in all about Android last night, I think we are
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.760]   sort of converging upon a particular feature set.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:23.840]   Um, but you know, I think that Apple's mo, uh, unlike Google's is to kind of work really
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:29.640]   slowly in secret and iterate and kind of slowly release what seemed to be very basic features
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.160]   like copy and paste.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:35.120]   Um, but, but they, but they take their time and they kind of, you know, that, that measure
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.000]   twice, cut one's thing.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.400]   And so it's interesting to me to see how what they come up with when, when, when Google's
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.120]   quick toggle settings page and, you know, in the notification shade and the, and the
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.840]   quick toggle settings area came out, I thought to myself, this is crazy.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.000]   That button doesn't represent anything.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.880]   Why do I have to tap so many times in order just to go into, into airplane mode?
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.000]   And so I think that, that Apple did some nice stuff here.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.560]   It doesn't feel innovative.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.480]   Well, that parallax effect does the thing.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.480]   There's some stuff.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   There's copying.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.480]   I said there's copying.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.640]   There's, uh, uh, what did I say?
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.640]   Copying.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.200]   Now I forgot my own aphorism.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.080]   Uh, catch up.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   Cop.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.240]   There's some catch up.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.240]   They're playing here.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.880]   There's some copying and then there's some innovation and it's probably an equal measure.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.520]   You know, I have no problem with this.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:19.720]   This is how it should be.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:24.600]   Each company should copy one another and, and, and, and do we iterate and get the best
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   possible product?
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.680]   Cause that's what's best for consumers.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:32.200]   But I think why it irritates people is that Apple has been so aggressively suing companies
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.560]   like Sam, like Sam's on who do the same thing.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.280]   Well, here's the other thing though.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:41.560]   The guys, I, I, I say this is no insult to Apple, but nothing wild being this.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.480]   This was a shrug to me.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.440]   And the truth is I haven't been wowed by anything new in a phone in what?
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.440]   Two years.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.440]   And it's impossible.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.960]   And so I think your point about, about, you know, we're, we're, we're arriving at, at,
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.320]   at the feature set is right.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   For both sides and a smartphone is a smartphone is a smartphone now.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.040]   Yeah, there's differences and yeah, you have choice and I love the choice, but there's
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.040]   really very little major difference.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.880]   You know, there were some surprises.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.800]   For instance, we thought maybe they would add, and maybe they will in, in the next iPhone
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   and this is just the preview.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.840]   Remember, this isn't the version of iOS that will ship in the fall, but they mentioned
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.000]   Passbook not at all.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.400]   They didn't mention any, you know, the only, they didn't mention, you know, how I might
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.200]   be able to use an NFC like technology.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.800]   There's a lot of stuff missing.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.520]   Passbook was the one of the big stories a year ago and they didn't say one word about
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.520]   it this year.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:38.000]   The other big story out of this one was the quiet mention that Siri goes to Bing.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   Yes.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.760]   It works so well for your maps, Apple.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.200]   No wonder you're doing it again.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:47.960]   There's still Google, Safari uses Google as its default search, but Siri now uses Bing
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:50.600]   for web searches.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.840]   Now somebody said yesterday that that's because Siri is a partner deal.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:49:00.920]   So all of the, all of the tools that Siri uses are basically financial arrangements that
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.760]   Apple makes with other companies like Wolfram Alpha.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.040]   So and Bing presumably.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:09.240]   So presumably Bing just gave more money.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.240]   That wouldn't be very aptly, would it?
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.560]   Well, no, that's how Siri works.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.560]   Siri is about partnerships.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:21.560]   But I think the, I do not like the new color palette at all and I don't, I think it's a
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.680]   little candy colored for the default icon.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.600]   It's a little Nicki Minaj to me.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.840]   FaceTime is bright green and this is how I icon is pretty bad.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.480]   The right phone and iTunes.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.480]   It's very bright.
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.320]   Look how bright it is.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.400]   And, you know, but that's a choice.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.360]   That's called design.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.000]   You make a choice.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.360]   And as they showed in that video at the very beginning, they, they really, at the very
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.120]   beginning, Apple set the tone for this.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.760]   Do we have that video that Apple ran at the very beginning of the conference?
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:59.640]   Because they essentially said having, having a lot, they, they really kind of, in a way,
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.440]   it was a backhand at, at Android.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.440]   At Android.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.920]   Having lots of choices does not mean good design.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.120]   Confusing abundance or quality.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.960]   It was like confusing abundance with choice or I forget how.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:13.960]   Exactly.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.960]   Exactly.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.320]   Let me see if I can find that video.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.040]   It was if everybody is making everything.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.040]   Here we go.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.040]   How can we perfect it?
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:28.760]   If everyone is busy making everything, I call that innovation and excitement.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   How can anyone perfect anything?
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.160]   They're really making a pitch for we're going to choose.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.920]   We start to confuse convenience, they say, with joy.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.000]   So we're going to choose joy for you.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.640]   Abundance with choice.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.640]   Wow.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.400]   And this all struck me as marketing, blather, blather.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.480]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.200]   What this is, is this is Johnny Ive.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.360]   This is designer point of view.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:59.600]   What does, what designers think rightly or wrongly is we know we'll do it for you.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.800]   You don't understand design.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   We do.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.800]   Let us do this.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   Right.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   It's the cathedral.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   The cathedral.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.120]   And that's that's completely legitimate point of view.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.720]   And what's nice is we have the bizarre to choose from as well.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.360]   I mean, we've got Android.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.720]   And so I don't have a problem with there.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.560]   A thousand those.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:24.280]   Those are all those Android devices for every yes.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.320]   We simplify.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.160]   We perfect.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:35.400]   We start over until everything we touch enhances each life.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.880]   Oh, you could stop it.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.880]   I know.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:38.880]   I hate that.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.880]   That's a little schmaltz.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.360]   But it is the point of view of all designers.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.360]   I have taste.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.120]   You don't let me design.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.520]   I see this all the time.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:51.440]   Please don't tell me what to do when which makes them so much fun to work with.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.720]   No, and this is why people don't like him.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:57.960]   But I also completely respect it when Rand.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.800]   I think the logo bigger.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.360]   Did the next logo was his name?
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.440]   Paul Rand who was it?
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.640]   Did the next logo?
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.240]   He said Steve Jobs said I want you to design the next logo.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:13.280]   Rand said I'd be glad to, but I don't want any input.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.040]   I'm not going to show you specs.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.840]   I'm not going to show you prototypes.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.160]   I'm going to give it to you.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.160]   It's done.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.680]   That's it.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.560]   And for $100,000 by the way.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.040]   And now it's a beautiful logo, but that's exactly the attitude.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.280]   This is not a collaborative process.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.280]   This is what you get.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.200]   And of course, he's a design superstar.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.800]   As you say, lunchman in the chatroom, he can say that.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.360]   And he could charge $100,000 for it.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.360]   And Jobs was glad to do it.
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:45.600]   And that's interesting because Jobs always saw himself as the same way.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.920]   I have taste.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:54.160]   Anyway, I don't like it, but I don't care because I'm not using it.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.320]   I'm an Android fanboy.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:56.320]   I love Android.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.640]   You don't like it because of the color scheme.
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.640]   I'd be feeling like I'm holding a piece of cotton candy.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.640]   Talk about it.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.640]   Talk about it.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.960]   With the new iPhone comes out, you're not going to get one, Leo, just to kind of talk.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   No, I have to get it.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.960]   No, no, that's my job.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.680]   Of course, we'll get it.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:20.840]   But I don't currently use my iPhone 5.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.840]   It's sitting on the shelf.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:26.000]   I saw nothing in iOS 7 that made me say, "Oh, I think I got to switch back."
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   Nothing there.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.600]   So then, Gina, to your point, what could the hardware do in the new phone that would
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.880]   be so amazing that I would say, "Oh, I got to switch back."
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.560]   And it's a little hard to imagine.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.400]   Here's the image that really says it all to me.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:48.400]   Nicki Minaj, iOS 7, together at last.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.480]   You guys will all say about the iPhone.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.040]   I'm not going to switch from Android, and this might be blasphemy.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.240]   But there is one thing that I will say about the iPhone, and that is that the phone is always
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.560]   very responsive, very smooth.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.920]   Takes great photos.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:08.880]   There are times on Android, even with pretty up-to-date hardware, where you get the spinner,
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:12.800]   you get the force closed, things feel a little jaggy, I got to go into what processors are
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.360]   running and kill them off.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.960]   The iOS experience, even with this beta, is very smooth, is much smoother.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:20.960]   There's no question that Android is.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.840]   And the one thing that I've been banging with Android is that the camera experience,
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:31.440]   I still, with me, can get really good photos with the iPhone with one hand, barely trying
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.160]   than I can with my Android phone.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.440]   On the Galaxy S4 has some huge bug, which means that the phone lags and sometimes resets
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.440]   the phone.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.160]   Yeah, you can't have lag when you...
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.160]   That took like three seconds.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.960]   Those are really the only two things.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.520]   Look, I think I tweeted this one after the keynote.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:53.800]   I feel like iOS 7 makes my phone look brand new, and it makes my app look ancient.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.160]   I'm definitely going to have to dive into iOS and just make my app.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:01.600]   I was wondering, because yeah, I guess all the app developers are scrambling now, because
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.680]   they have a palette, Apple gave them a palette.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:10.800]   And in fact, if I look at this iPhone 5, which is running iOS 7 and I look at...
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.760]   Oh, how do you unlock it now?
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.840]   It's a lie to the other side.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:16.840]   There you go.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.520]   Didn't used to be that way.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:21.680]   You look at the old, some of the old icons, they just look wrong.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.480]   No, my icon too is so detailed.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.040]   It looks completely wrong.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.040]   Completely.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.040]   So everybody's going to...
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:32.480]   Ways, fortunately, is looking great, but everybody else is going to have to redo their
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.480]   icons.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   In fact, when this seems to be too bright, it's like there's no contrast in this is the
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.080]   dock compared to what's going on up here.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:48.920]   I mean, I'm way too embedded in the Google ecosystem to switch back to iPhone.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.920]   And I don't have a desire to do that.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.000]   But that's the only thing about...
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.360]   I cracked my Galaxy Nexus screen, so I'm actually going to get the...
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:57.360]   Oh, I saw that yesterday.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.360]   You get the one?
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.360]   You can get the one.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.360]   All right.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.360]   Yeah, I am.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.360]   I'm going to get the one.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.360]   You're getting the vanilla one?
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.360]   I think I'm going to...
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.360]   I'm going to get the Google edition.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:08.360]   I know Leo said I know.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:11.360]   Well, here's what I would do.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:15.360]   I would get the regular edition because you'll be able to put the Google edition ROMs on it.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.120]   In other words, you'll have choice.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.120]   Right.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.120]   I could get the developer.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   This is the thing.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.600]   I have one of these pay-as-you-go, T-Mobile deals.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:22.800]   I don't want to get a contract.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.320]   I could just get the developer version, the HTC developer version, which comes with all
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:29.280]   the HTC stuff on it.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.280]   That's what I would do.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.320]   But you don't even need to do that because HTC makes it...
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:37.560]   It's easy to boot unlock any HTC one.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:46.640]   I immediately rooted in mine and put a weird ROM on it that gives me 4.2.2, but since it's
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.800]   the international ROM.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   Oh.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:53.120]   But the ability to do that, as opposed to getting the vanilla one from Google, you never have
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.560]   access to since at all.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.160]   Unless HTC puts it out, but they say they're not.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.160]   Right.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.280]   I'm not going to put out the Zoe, the camera, and all that stuff.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:04.080]   I still don't understand why they don't make those apps available separately because the
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:08.440]   more people download them, the more it proves how wonderful they are.
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:13.240]   They say they can't because they're tied so closely into additional stuff that's built
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.240]   into Sense, which is very possible.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.240]   Why is it possible?
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:19.000]   For instance, you have to have a different gallery app to understand the Zoes and things
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   like that.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   Mm.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.520]   And they couldn't restrict it to just the one, right?
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.360]   I don't think you can restrict apps to a particular device.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.360]   I think it's just a...
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.360]   Try you can.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.360]   All the time there are devices.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.360]   I can't download them.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.360]   Because it says, "No, you can't."
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.120]   While it won't let you do it.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.120]   Right, based on hardware.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:34.120]   Okay.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.120]   Right.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.120]   I'm going to look at that.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.120]   They could do that, right?
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:39.600]   They could just say, "Just the HTC One."
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.600]   Right.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.000]   I would get a normal one.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.440]   Because I'm sure that the Google ROM will be available within minutes.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:53.520]   So root it, put clockwork mod on it, and ROM manager.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.960]   And then when the...
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   Then you have everything.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   Anything you want.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.800]   I'm so lazy, though, that I might just want to just get the updates from Google, not have
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   to root.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.800]   I just, you know...
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:04.800]   I don't know.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:05.800]   I'm thinking about it.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:06.800]   I'm thinking about it.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.800]   This phone is still functioning.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:08.800]   And I still got a couple of days...
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.600]   You've got time to think about it.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.160]   I've got time to think about it before, before I have to...
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.160]   I can pull it right now.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.160]   And I'm very...
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.280]   I'm waffling back and forth between the Galaxy S4 and the HTC One.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.440]   The one is beautiful hardware.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.440]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.440]   It's beautiful.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.440]   I like the camera.
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.240]   I love the front-facing speakers.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.040]   They fit and they finish beautiful.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.040]   The battery.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.320]   Well, and I've got the battery now to a decent amount, but I still...
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.480]   Is that because you gave up stuff, Leo?
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:35.720]   It's because I put a lot of doohickeys on there.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.720]   Oh, okay.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:37.720]   I had to root it.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:40.200]   But the problem...
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:45.840]   And this is, by the way, Apple addressed this when they're talking about iOS 7.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:52.160]   This whole idea of AppNAP and coalescing wake locks and things like that.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.240]   That's the problem with Android is that any application can wake up the phone even when
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.240]   the screen's off.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.400]   Hey, I've got to get some data.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.840]   So basically, the phone remains in a wake state all the time.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.840]   And the battery goes...
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.400]   Facebook is the worst...
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:09.000]   One of the best things you can do to improve battery life on Android is to either remove
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.360]   Facebook or at the very least until it stops getting updates.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:17.040]   So that's the trick on Android is to tell things, stop getting updates.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:22.960]   And iOS can do it by fiat because Apple really controls the OS.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.200]   And they're just going to say, "Hey, you go through us if you want an update."
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.640]   And we're going to make sure we coalesce those.
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:32.600]   So they should be able to get great battery life on iOS 7.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:36.240]   That should make it even better.
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.840]   And so, yeah.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:41.880]   On the other hand, and this is kind of cheesy hardware, the Galaxy S4.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.680]   I know.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.880]   There's no perfect phone yet.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:46.880]   I'm still waiting.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.560]   You know what I'm really interested in?
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:52.680]   And Motorola asked us to a special briefing next week or the week after.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.680]   Oh, the Moto X phone.
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:56.680]   That's the one I'd wait for for.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.680]   Are you Gina?
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.680]   I think it's imminent.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.680]   I'll hang in there.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.680]   That's going to be the Nexus 4 next.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.680]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.840]   Is that again Leo?
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.840]   When did they invite me to?
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.800]   They invited me to a briefing and I have to assume it was for that.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.960]   I'm not going because I don't go to press briefings.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.960]   But they're still calling it...
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.760]   They're not saying anything.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.200]   Well they did call it X, didn't they?
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.760]   Yeah, they're calling it Moto X.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:22.760]   But it's not a droid.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.760]   They were calling it the X phone and now they're just calling it Moto X.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.760]   No X.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.320]   I think that...
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.280]   Without knowing anything about it potentially, that could be very interesting.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:35.360]   Yeah, the problem with doing all about Android is every week I get to hear about the great
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.160]   new phone that's right on the horizon.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.160]   That's why I...
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.360]   It's immediately going to have purchase regret.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.160]   That's why I like Android.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.160]   Choice.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.160]   Choice and abundance.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.160]   And abundance.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.160]   Nothing wrong with abundance.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.160]   Nothing wrong.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.160]   I'm a nice Italian boy.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.520]   Eat your meatballs.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.520]   You might have to wait till...
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.520]   You can't wait till October.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.800]   If it's not till September, October, that's too long.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.440]   Yeah, I know that is too long.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.680]   It breaks my heart every time I look at the screen.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.320]   We'll see.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.520]   Let's take a break when we come back to Google Change Log, Gina Trippani will tell us everything
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.440]   that's happened at Google and it's not a whole lot.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   It's not a lot this week.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.800]   They're kind of resting after a very productive Google I.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.800]   Well they're trying to snoop on us all so that's what they're doing.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:21.800]   They don't have to.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:27.040]   The beauty of Steve's hypothesis, they don't have to do anything they don't even have to
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.720]   know about it.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:35.480]   And you know they did Google has asked, as have some other companies, to be able to
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.360]   be more open about what they're being asked for.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.000]   Yes, they want to enhance the transparency report.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.240]   Let us talk about these NSLs.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.360]   In fact, we should have Brian Fitzpatrick on sometimes.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.360]   I'd love to.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.040]   Because he worked on the transparency board.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.440]   He's the data liberation guy.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.320]   Yes, love him.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.840]   Would you put make a note in that chat?
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.640]   Let's get to Brian on.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.640]   Fits they call it.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.640]   Right.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.640]   Fits.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.640]   Fits.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:02.560]   And by the way we should note here that Twitter's role here.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:08.680]   And Twitter though, it fuddles me sometimes with its relationship with developers and users.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.800]   Whatever it was, Twitter's been left out of this list because Twitter has really held
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.160]   on principle and tried to hold back.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:19.000]   Now Twitter surely has had Pfizer requests too, though they have less data value.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.800]   And they've got to deal with that as well.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.280]   But, you know, let's hats off to Twitter.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.720]   Yeah, they, well.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.320]   But what have they not done?
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.920]   The theory is true though.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.240]   So theory is true, which sounds like it could be.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.800]   They don't need consent from these companies.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.000]   They could have tapped Twitter's outgoing.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.600]   Well, no, but then, you know, then why would there be any Pfizer warrant requests?
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.600]   I'll tell you why.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.240]   And this is the whole point of this, in this why you once you know who, then you know what
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.240]   you go for.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.480]   You know, by the way around, you collect everything.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.720]   Once you're in an investigation, you go back and you say, "Oh yeah, interesting.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.800]   There's a bunch of direct messages going on between this guy in Egypt and this guy in
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.480]   Syria."
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.040]   Then you go to, you know where it came from because you tapped it at the source.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.040]   You could say, "Hey, Twitter."
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.800]   You're making a very limited request, Pfizer request, and the company has no choice but
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.960]   to say, "Okay, that's not over.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.960]   It's an MSL.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.960]   I got to give it to you."
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.680]   Twitter, we know these conversations happen on this day, at this time.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.680]   Who was that?
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.800]   Twitter says, "Here you go.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   I can't stop you."
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   I can't stop you.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.680]   None of these companies are saying they do not comply with federal requests.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.720]   Of course they do.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.720]   They'd be in jail if they didn't.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.720]   Right.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.960]   So this is the beauty of Steve's theory and it may be a castle made of air, I don't know,
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.440]   because no one knows.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:40.280]   But the beauty of this theory is all the federal government has to do is go to the tier one
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:46.320]   service providers, which includes names like Verizon and AT&T, where we heard those names
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:52.640]   before, and say to them, "I want to plug in to where Google, Twitter, Facebook goes
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.040]   onto the internet.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.120]   I want to stop that date off."
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.920]   Stop there earlier for a second.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.600]   Because what authority do they need to do that?
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   Because that is snooping on us all.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.200]   Well, and this was Steve said.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200]   Is it warrant?
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.520]   No, well, this was Steve said.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:12.000]   This is public internet.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.560]   So you may not be illegal to gather this data.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.560]   So anybody can do that.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.560]   It's public internet.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.560]   Anybody can just...
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.560]   I don't know.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.560]   You know?
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.560]   I don't know.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.560]   That's a very good question.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.560]   I don't know.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.600]   I think we need to ask our legal friends about this.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600]   But...
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.320]   Let's get a Snowden on the show.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.320]   We can talk to...
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.320]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.320]   I know you're in Hong Kong for a while.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.880]   But this is how you get a whole lot to do.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.720]   But we know already that neither AT&T nor Verizon had any scruples at all about handing
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.800]   everything over.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   Right?
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.160]   These backbone companies, nobody's going to the backbone companies and saying, "Hey,
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.400]   Level 3, what are you telling the feds?"
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400]   Nobody's asked them.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.400]   That's the story now.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.960]   Nobody knows to ask them.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960]   That's who you need to ask.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:03.160]   And they may say, instead of a blanket denial, we're not allowed to speak, which is the truth.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   That's really true.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.160]   That's a stretch in the day.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.160]   Right.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.400]   That's what Google, Facebook would have said.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.400]   Right.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.360]   If they had been combined, they couldn't talk.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.360]   Right.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.360]   They would have said...
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.360]   Exactly.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.360]   We are legally...
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.360]   They're not required to lie.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.360]   They're required not to reveal anything.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.360]   Okay.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.360]   They can't be required to lie.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.360]   Right.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.920]   So they can say, "We can't discuss this."
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.920]   Exactly.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.920]   And then they didn't.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.920]   Okay.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.920]   So, all right.
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:30.160]   So we got to find the person who says, "I can't discuss it."
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.160]   And guess what?
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.680]   The telcos have been indemnified by the federal government for exactly this kind of data revolution.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:39.840]   Wonder why?
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:45.560]   Why would the federal government make the step of indemnifying the telcos if they weren't
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.560]   doing this?
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.920]   I think it all fits together.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:54.560]   That's why very intelligent analysis...
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:59.960]   That's why very intelligent analysis...
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.960]   Oh, my...
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960]   Mama Mia.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.960]   What do Italians say instead of...
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.960]   Don't!
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.760]   Well, we say "Oe-vee," but that's not Italian.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.760]   No, no.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.960]   The Italian way to say that...
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.960]   "Oe-ve-a-ria."
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.960]   No, I think...
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960]   "Oe-ve-a-ria."
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960]   "Oe-ve-a-ria."
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.960]   Oh, my God!
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.960]   I would say Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.960]   Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.960]   Holy cow.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:25.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.960]   But that's exactly the reaction.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.960]   "Oe-me-o-de-yo."
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:28.960]   "Porko-ka."
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.960]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:30.960]   There you go.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:31.960]   "Porko-de-yo."
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.560]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.760]   Those were very, very foul vulgarities in Italian, so I apologize.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.280]   Anybody who speaks Italian.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:44.440]   I was taught to swear in Italian by Italian chess master.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.840]   I used to play chess, and he would...
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.960]   The worst vulgarities ever.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.960]   So, if you speak Italian, I apologize.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.960]   Maron!
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:54.960]   Maron!
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.960]   Maron!
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.960]   Maron!
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.960]   Maron!
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   Oh!
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:06:59.960]   I love Italian.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:04.360]   I can't wait to go to Italy.

[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, break out the trumpets.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.120]   It's time for the Google change log.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.680]   The Google change log.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.680]   [MUSIC]
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.680]   [CAMERA CLICKS]
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.360]   Really thin change log this week.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.360]   There's no kidding.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.040]   Yeah, we're post-Google I/O, we're mid-prism.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.760]   But a couple of new things.
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:00.760]   First, Google has released the stock Android keyboard.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:01.760]   It's great.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.720]   So Android 4.0 and above in the Play Store.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.240]   So anybody who's got an Android device running 4.0 and above and doesn't want to use the carrier
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:12.440]   supplied keyboard, just go over to Play Store, search for Google keyboard, and you can save
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.240]   compatible your device and download it.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.980]   And of course, the keyboard has gesture typing and voice typing and next word suggestions
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:20.320]   and dictionaries for 20 seconds.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.120]   Languages and works across your devices, tablets and phones, really nice.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:32.040]   So this Google keyboard joins a list of apps which Google continues to sort of decouple
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.840]   from Android and offer in the Play Store.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:41.240]   Gmail, Calendar, Chrome, Hangouts, YouTube, Google Search, Voice Search, Sound Search,
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.240]   Maps, Earth.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:46.920]   I mean, they're really Google+, we had the Google Play services kind of get decoupled
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.120]   so that it can issue updates.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:52.880]   The reason why they're doing this is so that they can issue updates to these core Google
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.880]   apps.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.880]   Otherwise, they're in the Play Store.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.800]   Right, unless they don't want to get hung up in the whole operating system push out.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.040]   So this is a nice way to do it.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.680]   We talked about this in all about Android last night.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.240]   There's still a few apps that they could decouple.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.240]   They haven't the camera.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.240]   Which one's camera, yeah?
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.640]   Camera, gallery, the launcher, people.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:12.640]   So yeah.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   Launcher would be cool because we all, you know, I think we all use third party launchers.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.320]   These days, a Google vanilla launcher.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.520]   It would be kind of fun, right?
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.280]   How much of that stuff?
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.440]   Let me ask a question then.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:32.440]   How much of that kind of separate release would make it okay for you to get a Samsung
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.440]   or HTC?
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:39.480]   Well, I got to tell you, having Nova launcher available made me happy with Samsung.
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.080]   Otherwise, I wouldn't have used it because Samsung puts the apps button in the wrong
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.960]   spot and there's this weird stuff.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.760]   So having a custom launcher.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.080]   And Nova launcher is about as close to 422's launcher as you can get.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.800]   So I think third party launchers are like third party keyboards.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.800]   A very important part of Android and other reason to choose Android, I think.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.720]   Yeah, you can make any really any phone your own.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:03.400]   To answer your question, Jeff, you just have to have the Play Store on your phone, right?
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.120]   So it has to be a Google-approved device in that it has the Play Store, but then, yeah,
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.120]   I mean, you really contain it.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:13.320]   What I'm really saying is I don't want to buy an HTC or a Samsung phone because I
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.680]   don't want all the craft because you would say to you, right?
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:19.880]   But if I can add, rather than taking all that off and putting the stock Android on there,
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.800]   if I can add enough stock Android stuff on top of Samsung or HTC, does that change my
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.400]   attitude about buying one of their phones?
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.360]   Well, the problem is there's some stuff that you just can't uninstall and there are some
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.480]   things that get disabled.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.600]   So like tethering, for example, that's one reason why I might not get a contract HTC
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.600]   one, right?
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.760]   Because I like to tether, right?
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.240]   And that's kind of, that's enabled in vanilla, pure vanilla Android, but that's disabled
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:49.040]   unless you pay for it or whatever, and other, in carrier supply versions of Android.
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:52.080]   And sometimes there are apps that you just can't, they disable uninstalling.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.600]   So you're still, so you kind of like, you can put the core Google experience apps on
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.400]   top of what comes with it, but then the attraction of vanilla Android for me is none of the
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.040]   craft that you can't uninstall and then also just direct updates from Google.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.920]   I never want there to be a version of Android that comes out that I either have to wait
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:12.080]   for or I have to root and romp for necessarily.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.080]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:17.960]   But you know, when you get the, if you got a sense based HTC one, Facebook can't be
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.960]   uninstalled.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   Facebook cannot be uninstalled.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.600]   No, you can disable it.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.480]   You can't just uninstall it.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.480]   So that's an example.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.480]   So I mean, it's most things.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.320]   It's like, okay, find icons in the app drawer, like, okay, you know, does that, is that
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.320]   going to bother you enough?
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.040]   I mean, maybe I'm on, maybe I'm super anal.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:39.880]   See, if you unlike the iPhone, if you don't like the, the candy cane color scheme, you
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.160]   can get any color scheme, any theme, any launcher.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.800]   These are so highly customizable.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.760]   That's true.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.200]   That's, I think that's a really strong argument for it.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.600]   For instance, I agree.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.360]   I don't like it that 422 requires this Google bar at the top.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.520]   On this, on this, I can turn it off in the launcher.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.360]   So you know, Nova launcher says, do you want it or not?
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.800]   And so I, you know, I leave it on, but you don't have to if you don't, if you didn't
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.040]   want that space used.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.800]   So in some ways, I think having a launcher on top of 422, vanilla is probably a good
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.800]   idea.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.280]   That's actually a really good point about that Google bar.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.640]   I'd never tried to remove it, but you're right.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.640]   You can't remove it.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:17.640]   It's a waste of space.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.360]   I mean, I actually use it, but, but yeah.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.760]   Well, you know what I do?
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.800]   I, I do use it because it's the now button.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.680]   So what you could do instead is have a now button and then I made swipe up be the voice
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.680]   search.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:32.160]   So that's a very easy gesture I can do with my thumb.
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.160]   I can do any time.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.960]   It doesn't require exactly double tapping or finding this little tiny microphone icon.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:38.960]   Do that.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:39.960]   It's very easy to do.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.280]   So that's something that the, the Nova launcher lets you do.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:44.080]   And I think that it's things like that.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.120]   Boy, that's to me, it's just a no brainer for Android.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:50.560]   I really, I just, I like to be able to do stuff like that.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:51.560]   I agree.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.760]   I, I wonder whether or not iOS 7 was going to have some sort of home screen customization
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.240]   that was, that went beyond being able to add as many icons as you want to a folder,
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.240]   which everyone collapsed at.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.240]   And I was like, Oh, you poor.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.240]   Come on.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.240]   That's so sad.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.240]   That's so sad.
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.440]   I had, I had a serious moment of Android.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.440]   It's a period already.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.680]   I will, I will admit to that.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.040]   I was like, Oh, that's too bad.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:16.760]   But yeah, I mean, you know, the parallax effect is cool, but still I really widgets are huge
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:17.760]   or huge.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.960]   There's two live icons.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:23.840]   There's now the clock icon shows the actual time and the calendar icon, which is always
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:27.720]   showed the day, continues to show the day, the weather icon, which should show the weather.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.080]   Apple made a big deal about doesn't show the weather.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.680]   Does it actually come on?
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.280]   I have to open weather to see what the weather is.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.280]   Come on.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:39.640]   Of course, all you have to do is come on.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:43.240]   Next time you go on like this, we'll come on.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.040]   All right.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:52.280]   So this is so, so the second 50% of the change log this week, very, very minor change to
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.880]   Google image search.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.400]   Now when you do an image search for something, so the example on Google, Google operating
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:02.240]   system here is if you search for Nexus seven, there's a related search bar across the top.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.480]   And actually the related search bar will, will suggest other searches, but will show
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.160]   you thumbnails of what you'll get in those searches as well.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.680]   So you're really kind of doing multiple searches at once.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:15.400]   There's also a story in the rundown about how Google did the image search, that there
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:21.760]   was a University of Toronto company that developed a whole bunch of fancy, fancy, fancy technology
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.720]   and Google bought them to get that.
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:28.320]   Oh yeah, this is the on the research blog, how they're doing the semantic search on your
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.280]   last, the other week when we were doing, you know, search my photos for flowers or search
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.840]   my photos for food, right?
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.840]   The image recognition.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.840]   DNN research, exactly.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:43.720]   It spun out of a UT project from Professor Jeffrey Hinton.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:44.720]   That's kind of cool.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.880]   That's really cool.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:50.360]   Yeah, so I, so I just did an image search for Leo Leport and I get young.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.520]   I get young photos.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.160]   I get 2013 photos.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.160]   What?
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.160]   So you can do it.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.160]   Now I got to do that.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.160]   That's cool.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.160]   I haven't noticed that.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160]   Okay.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.280]   So we'll do a quick episode of us googling ourselves.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.920]   Yeah, and that's really the whole point of Google.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.720]   But by the way, I got to point out young.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.200]   I know that one on the left.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.200]   Is that even me?
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.200]   Who is that?
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:20.360]   No, that looks like, it looks like one guy was on used to be the young Leo Leport.
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:25.520]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520]   That's great.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.120]   Oh, I'm glad they have an entry called Sexting.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.840]   That's wonderful.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.360]   Really, wife's studio.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.480]   This is interesting.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.880]   So this is that is this is from a University of Toronto group.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.880]   That's very interesting.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:39.880]   Huh.
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:42.320]   And then it just gives you the pool of stuff.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.320]   Cool.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.320]   Yep.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.960]   With other people in it, but I guess all related to me.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:52.080]   I don't know who that guy is.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.520]   Let us, let us move on.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:57.000]   That's all I got for the changelog.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.320]   That is a Google change log.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:07.440]   Play the drums.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.040]   The Google change log.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:12.360]   Did you see the glass tear down?
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.360]   That was kind of cool.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.760]   Did it make you sad?
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.600]   Gina, to see it all taken apart.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.600]   I guess so.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.760]   I have been sort of treating it with kid gloves.
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.840]   I have to.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:26.920]   I seeing it kind of torn apart was a little bit like, oh, I always react to tear downs
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:27.920]   that way.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.920]   Yeah, it is pretty simple.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.920]   Mm-hmm.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.920]   So yeah.
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:38.920]   It's a couple of circuit boards, a battery, a little transducer for the ear.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.280]   Cool.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.120]   And this is from catwig.com.
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.480]   I honestly have not been using glass as much as.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.480]   Really?
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.480]   As much as I should be.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.880]   I should really be trying to.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:55.240]   I need to give it kind of the serious effort of integrating it to my life.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.000]   I haven't quite gotten there yet.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.360]   I put up a Google+ post.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.360]   I saw that.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:05.880]   Hey, hey, Google, unless you want Robert Scoble to be heads for the official spokesman for
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:08.320]   class, would you get it out to the rest of us?
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.520]   And then I said, no offense, Robert, but I'd step over my grandmother to get it.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:18.040]   And of course, the comment exchange was taken over by people going after Robert and Robert
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.040]   answering back.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.040]   It's serious.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.040]   You can't.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.600]   The notion of publicness and everything else.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.600]   It's kind of great.
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.600]   He's a lightning rod.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.600]   Oh, he's amazing.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.600]   He's a lightning rod.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.280]   But if I had glass folks, are starting to get them right.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.200]   Jen, I don't think it's long for you.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.200]   Is it OK?
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.040]   Well, I'm hearing as people who got their confirmation on Google+.
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:40.880]   OK, but those of us who got confirmation on Twitter, I still have this fear that it was
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.640]   actually a fake account on Twitter.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.080]   I didn't do anything on Twitter.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.840]   I think it was a verified account.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:46.840]   Wasn't it a verified account?
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:47.840]   Wasn't it?
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.840]   I think you're going to be OK.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.120]   It's funny that they would make tweeters way longer though than Google+.
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.440]   Yeah, well, it makes sense.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.440]   I can't play that.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.920]   It kind of makes sense because Google+ is going to build in the glass sharing and Google+
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:58.920]   is building the glass.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:01.240]   But let me ask you now, Jeff.
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.720]   In some ways, I think the delay might have helped you.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:09.040]   Do you still want to spend $1,500 on this?
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.040]   I wouldn't.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:15.120]   It's a good question because it's not unlike phone questions.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:19.880]   I would rather get probably what they learn from this and get the consumer device.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:24.360]   Yeah, I mean, you're getting a very limited device for $1,500.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:33.600]   But given what I do here and what I do in my day job, I probably should get it.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.080]   If your day job would pay for it, I would do it.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.240]   Well, that's what I'm going to try to make it do.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:44.160]   That's why Jason has the latest on the initial sale.
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.800]   Big job paid for it.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.600]   Google Glass Explorers getting notifications from UPS.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.000]   Have you got a notification?
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.960]   Maybe it's just going to arrive one day.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.520]   They can't because you got to go through the whole Macgilla.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:56.760]   I don't know.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:02.000]   They say they're just getting these strange notifications, order processed, ready for
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.160]   UPS, shipped to them by GoogleX.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:09.040]   Well, they didn't pick a color yet.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.920]   Maybe there's an invitation in the UPS.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.720]   That's probably what it is.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:14.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.120]   Because they're not going to just pop up.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.040]   They don't have my home address.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.040]   Oh, OK.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.040]   I guess they do.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.040]   They have everything.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.440]   They just went and called the NSA and said, what's Jarvis's home address?
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.440]   No problem.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.120]   We got it right here.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:31.560]   Apparently, somebody in this I'd be much more interested.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.080]   I paid more for this.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:38.040]   Has put a Google Glass capabilities into contact lenses.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.200]   Now that I pay for it.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:46.800]   They put the first effort to get a screen into a contact lens so that-- and they put
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:47.800]   it on a rabbit.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.000]   So the rabbit wore it for six hours and didn't rub its eyes.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   So it's OK.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.400]   Thank God they tested it thoroughly.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.640]   And not the rest of the UK.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.840]   Because medics, however, were gravidant nuts.
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:01.360]   Yeah, I was burning.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:08.480]   They to coat it a contact lens with a conductor and then place a light emitting diode on it.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.080]   I love this idea.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.960]   I would-- you know, if this is 10 years off, I'm happy.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.960]   I hope it is.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.160]   Because that's my big problem with glass.
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.800]   So this way, you didn't even know you were wearing it.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:23.200]   Well, but wouldn't be able to take pictures and send them a lens via display.
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.200]   That's fine.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.200]   I guess you have to camera somewhere else.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.560]   Put a camera into your eyebrow and then we're OK.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:34.720]   Google filed a patent to let you unlock your phone with not merely face recognition, but
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:39.440]   faces, winks, smile, scrimmises.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:40.280]   I hope this is--
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.400]   You can just turn your tongue out.
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.600]   I hope this is true.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.600]   Unlock.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.200]   I would love that.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.200]   An ocular movement, sticking out your tongue, opening your mouth, moving your eyebrows.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.160]   Nobody has my face and can do this.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:55.160]   I can't do it because of the patent file.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.160]   I look that.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.760]   Isn't that funny?
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.360]   I think that's smart.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.400]   So you have to like do the Z with your eyes.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.400]   Me.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:10.080]   Oh, no, you then unlock the phone.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.400]   [SINGING]
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:19.880]   Google's going to be banned in Pakistan if it doesn't clean up YouTube.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:22.920]   I don't even know whether it's worth talking about it.
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:23.920]   Of course.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.920]   No.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:25.920]   No.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:26.920]   I thought this.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:30.760]   Google search hits and YouTube views are a key predictor of whether a movie's going
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.800]   to make bucks at the box office.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:37.560]   But what that's really saying, Nolio, is buzz.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.560]   An interest is the key predictor.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:42.720]   So it's not as if there's a causation or anything like that.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.120]   It just says that people are curious about a movie before it comes out.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.120]   If it has enough buzz, that's a predictor.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:50.160]   We've seen that before predicting presidential elections, too, right?
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.120]   I mean, this isn't that much of a surprise.
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.720]   I think it makes a lot of sense.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:58.360]   Twitter has been a key predictor in the same way that the discussion of a movie for
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.520]   two weeks beforehand.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:04.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:10.200]   So the red line on this graph is box office index.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:14.240]   The blue line is non-title film-related search.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.400]   And the gray one is the search for that specific title.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.520]   And boy, they could not be more closely linked.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.520]   That's practically one-to-one correlation.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.520]   Speaking of movies.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.520]   Yes.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.520]   Yes.
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.520]   Yes, you did, too.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.520]   You did it, Leo.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.520]   Is it in the theaters?
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.520]   It is.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.320]   It opened this past weekend.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:38.520]   Well, I'm hearing very good things about it.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.960]   Gina, you first.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:41.960]   It's okay.
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   You know what?
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:46.040]   I'm too close to Google to be able to sort of, because, you know, just been covering
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.400]   it for so many years with you two, that I found myself thinking, like, well, that's
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:51.640]   not the head of search.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.200]   Like, I was like, about the, like, casting decisions.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.200]   And, you know, there were some lines that were sort of cheesy.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:24:59.800]   Oh, this is in our DNA.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:00.800]   That's not in our DNA.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:03.880]   I'd be like, oh, that would be a nuclear, you know, orientation.
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:07.320]   So I was being this sort of annoying, nitpicking geek.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:10.600]   I found it interesting that the, I don't think this is a spoiler.
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:15.960]   I mean, the moral of the story was basically that human empathy matters as much, if not
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:20.560]   more than data and algorithms, which I thought was kind of ironic.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.720]   I don't think that's true.
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.560]   Because it's not true with Google.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:24.560]   I don't think that's true.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.560]   It's not true.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.560]   And there was a line where they, there was one line where they said diversity is in our
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.440]   DNA, which I also thought meaning diversity of their staff, which I thought was a little
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.440]   bit like that.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.440]   Aww.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:35.440]   Is that not true?
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:36.440]   Aww.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:37.440]   I don't know.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.440]   What about, is it?
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:41.440]   But overall, it was fine.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.640]   It was enjoyable there.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.640]   There were a couple of laughs.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:46.000]   I thought, you know, I mean, oh, and well said.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.280]   I thought the first half was pretty excruciatingly boring.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.280]   And the last half became charming.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.280]   All the complaints about, oh, it's a commercial for Google.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.920]   What was it supposed to be?
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.720]   Yeah, it's very much a commercial for Google.
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:01.720]   Absolutely.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.720]   It's an homage to Google.
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:04.080]   Clearly, Google cooperated with them.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:07.920]   And, you know, there were a couple of cameos, Paige and Bryn were both in it.
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.560]   You know, it was interesting.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:13.400]   I mean, if you think about the Facebook movie, the social network versus the internship,
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.640]   and Neil asked, you know, what are the cultural implications that the Facebook movie was such
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.080]   a different experience, right, than the internship?
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.400]   You know, one was, I think, kind of very, very critical of Facebook and cast Zuckerberg
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:28.320]   and this sort of negative light, whereas this was a very sort of lighthearted romp through,
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:31.320]   you know, this wonderland that is this campus or whatever.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.280]   I don't know.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.280]   It was fine.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.280]   It was fine.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.280]   I think a lot of people could--
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.720]   The whole thing is about a competition.
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.280]   And one of the-- I saw one of the-- a real-life injury and wrote about the movie.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:44.280]   They had a lot of that going on and on and on.
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:45.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.720]   And one said, the experience is not like that.
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.360]   It's not a competition.
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.520]   But then again, everything at Google was probably a competition to some extent.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:55.680]   Well, interestingly, the final bit of the competition when it came down to it, and this
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.560]   might be a little bit of a spoiler, but I won't say more, but it was selling advertising,
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.840]   right, like the thing that the team was going to win, whether it was whether or not they
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:04.840]   could sell--
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.760]   All we would know is what Google's business is.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.480]   So which was interesting, which is definitely interesting.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.400]   I'll go see it then.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.120]   It sounds like I should see it, because I am--
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.680]   Well, maybe it's on the show.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:19.680]   Did you like it, Jeff?
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.680]   I'm--
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:23.680]   [SINGING]
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:30.400]   --and expect more from a professional critic than me.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.920]   Be minus, OK.
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:33.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:37.000]   I would say that if you didn't do what we do-- if you have a-- if you have a-- if you
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   have a-- it's a perfectly pleasant night.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000]   You can take your kids to it.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   That's fine.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.480]   It would be a happily spent hour and a half on cable.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.480]   Good.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.480]   I'll save it.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.480]   --to the wedding movies for cable.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.680]   Oh, you should go see Leah.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.160]   Oh, all right.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.160]   That's not Renass.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.120]   The glass was in it, Arthur.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.120]   The self-driving car was in it.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.400]   The glass was in the name of Arthur.
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.640]   No, no, the-- in the chat room.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:05.920]   The chat, Arthur in the chat, Renass.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:06.920]   It's the glass.
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:07.920]   Oh, OK.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:08.920]   Gina, do you see glass?
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:09.920]   I didn't see glass.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:13.160]   I think it wasn't-- wasn't a Sergei wearing glass?
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.160]   No, there was a-- people have been debating about that.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.800]   I think it was like presumed.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:17.800]   It was--
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:18.800]   Oh.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:19.800]   It was.
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:20.800]   Mm.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.800]   Huh.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:24.600]   I don't-- at this point, does he go anywhere without glass?
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.560]   That's where we're so used to seeing him with glass.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.960]   It just assumed to be part of his face.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:30.600]   Yeah, it just assumed it was part of his face, exactly.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.800]   But no, it was not-- glass was not part of the-- it was not a major part of the--
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:34.800]   No, not at all.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.800]   --plot ball.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.800]   No.
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:37.800]   Yeah, sense boring to be honest.
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:38.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:41.800]   But it was, you know, it was just a stupid comedy.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:42.800]   Sounds dull.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:43.800]   Yeah, it's all it is.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.280]   We're going to take a break.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.760]   Come back with our tip tool and number of the week, but first a word from Arthur.
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.600]   Come Squarespace.com, the best hosting in the world.
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:29:01.520]   Tied to a remarkable content management system that is not only gorgeous but very, very effective,
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:02.920]   powerful.
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:06.000]   Squarespace has an award-winning design team.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.680]   They're always working on new templates, new features.
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:11.680]   They just added a new calendar feature called the Events Collection.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.920]   You could share scheduled updates.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.920]   It'd be great for us.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.360]   We got to start using that.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.160]   Or you could use it for store sales band.
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.840]   Two or dates, that kind of thing.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.720]   The template momentum is absolutely stunning.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:25.200]   It's a full bleed template.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.200]   This one is one of their newer templates.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.400]   You know the best way to do this?
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.640]   Go to squarespace.com.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.160]   Click that Get Started button.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.800]   You don't need to give them a credit card or anything.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.640]   Just an email address, a password or the name of your site.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:39.400]   And you can start designing right now.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.720]   Like within minutes, set up a site.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:42.880]   Play with the templates.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:43.880]   Drag and drop.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:50.240]   And import all your content from your existing website, preserving all the SEO, all the images,
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.840]   all the links, even all the comments.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.080]   And see what your site would look like on a Squarespace server.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:00.000]   Until all your friends that try to bring the server down, you won't be able to.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000]   You won't be able to.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.600]   One of the nice things about Squarespace is all of their designs are mobile ready.
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:09.480]   So you don't have a kind of a junky looking mobile site.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.960]   Like I do.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.160]   I'm going to move to Squarespace.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.160]   I say this every time.
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:19.680]   You make one of your designs and it looks great on a 27-inch monitor, on an iPad, on
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.840]   an iPhone.
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.680]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.200]   They call it mobile responsive design.
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.000]   It's the latest, greatest stuff.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   You don't have to be a designer or a developer to use Squarespace.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.720]   But if you are, they have tools for you, including an amazing developer platform.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:40.240]   You can import and export from all your existing social media.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.520]   Automatically link it up.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.520]   Choose contributors.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.760]   Assign them permissions too.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:50.040]   You have administrator, billing, content editor, reporting, comment moderator, trusted
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:52.520]   comment or store manager, all of that stuff.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:56.680]   So you can really, great statistics.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:57.960]   I can go on and on.
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.280]   I want you to try it free for two weeks.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.560]   Just kind of run around, mess with it.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.360]   Do anything you'll feel like.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:09.200]   Then if you decide you want a Squarespace site, take a look at the pricing.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.080]   You're going to be blown away.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:13.280]   The basic plan is $8 a month.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:16.520]   But I think the most popular is the $16 a month unlimited plan.
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:17.840]   That's when you pay for a year.
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.960]   It's $20 if you just want to go month to month.
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.160]   And you can always do that.
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:22.640]   You're not locked in.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:27.320]   For $16 a month, you get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.320]   bandwidth.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.920]   You'll never get a bandwidth bill, even if you become the most popular site on the internet.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.400]   Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:40.360]   When you buy a year plan, they also hook up the custom domain for free.
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:44.640]   If you decide you want to do e-commerce, add another $8 a month, $24 a month.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:49.480]   And you have fully integrated e-commerce, mobile responsive, get a mobile store, unlimited
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:52.640]   physical or digital products, inventory tracking.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:57.360]   They'll do tax calculations, shipping calculations, coupon controls.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.360]   I can go on and on.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.320]   I mean, this is really great.
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.200]   Please just go to squarespace.com and click get started.
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.080]   You know, if you only need a site for two weeks, that's it.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.080]   You're done.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:09.920]   But if you decide you want to stick around, use our offer code because we'll get you 10%
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:10.920]   off your first purchase.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:13.120]   That's why the full year is the best deal.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.320]   I think they even have packages longer than that.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:17.240]   Twig six is our offer code.
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:22.360]   TWIG in the number six for the six month, June, which is the month we are in right now.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:29.680]   TWIG in the number six, squarespace.com, the best place to host your next website.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:34.000]   In a trip, Annie has our tip of the week.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.800]   Well, I just revised our tip, our my tip because Enzo here in the chat room just let
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:39.800]   me know.
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:41.320]   Something that Jeff is going to be very happy about.
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:47.080]   It looks like Google just released a new app for Android for Google Cloud Print.
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.560]   They're doing just what you said they were going to do.
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:50.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.560]   More stuff.
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.400]   Actually, there's never they had there was a third party cloud print.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.800]   I have it on here.
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.800]   You can show it.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.280]   I've already installed it.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:00.280]   You've already installed this.
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.280]   Oh, from, yeah.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:04.280]   It just got released like in the past hour.
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:08.680]   So you can print from any compatible Android device to any Google Cloud Print connected
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:14.320]   computer, share a picture or document from apps like gallery directly to cloud print,
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.400]   and you can track the status of your of your print job.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.760]   So I haven't had a chance to install this yet.
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.440]   I actually don't have a cloud print printer set up yet.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.440]   Although Jeff is really sold on it.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:26.880]   I don't use my Mac at home, which pretty much now is nothing but a cloud print server
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:30.400]   and print through it over Wi-Fi to my printer here.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.560]   Well, I can print.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:37.400]   I'm going to print an image right now to my Epson workforce pro at home, which is a cloud
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.920]   print printer on my network.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:42.120]   And you have all the print dialog is all here.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:45.320]   I'm going to print one copy.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.440]   And I'm going to say go.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.840]   And now this is sending it to my printer at home.
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:53.480]   I also have a cloud print printer here at the office I could send it to.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.480]   It also shows you all the print jobs you've done.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:56.640]   This one, these two are queued.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.360]   These are printed already.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:00.320]   I mean, this is great.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:04.400]   This is really, yeah, I mean, I'm printing from an Android phone, but from a Pixel or
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.560]   a Chromebook also a great choice.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.680]   I do it from all my devices.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.560]   It's really nice to be able to cloud print.
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:13.800]   And one of them would be great in the future is if you're visiting an office or something
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.640]   on the whiteboard, it has the Wi-Fi password.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.800]   It should then have the cloud print printer.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:20.720]   Well, if you have this app though, it just tells you what your printers are.
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:21.720]   It's all set up.
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.360]   And what I'm saying that when you want to print at a hotel or someone.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.360]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:27.360]   They should give you that.
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:28.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.840]   That's a great idea.
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.400]   I just sent my mom a printer because she needs a new photo printer.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:36.680]   And I made sure it was cloud print capable because I'm going to set it up so that I can
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:38.400]   print stuff for her.
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.040]   It'll scare her to death.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.040]   Well, but think about it.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.480]   I want to send her a recipe.
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:45.880]   I could email it to her, but it would be a lot easier if I just say, oh, I'm going to print
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:46.880]   it out for you.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.320]   And then we're on islands coming out.
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.320]   Done.
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.720]   I should set up a photo printer at my mom.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.720]   Exactly.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:54.720]   Exactly.
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:00.280]   Except for the whole part where you're putting ink on paper, which is kind of ancient technology.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:01.560]   I just don't print that much.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:05.160]   That's why I've never gone through the trouble of setting up cloud print because I print so
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.160]   infrequently.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:10.320]   But something like that, like sending my mom pictures of the baby, like that would be
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.320]   or just messages.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:13.080]   My mom just doesn't like to check her email.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:16.960]   That's a really good problem is you just you have to have a computer or kind of a connected
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:17.960]   to a printer, right?
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:20.520]   Oh, you get a product with cloud printer.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:22.160]   Yeah, you buy a cloud printer.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.120]   So I only buy Wi-Fi printers now.
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.360]   You're crazy to buy a printer that has to be connected.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.880]   Just get every printer that has Wi-Fi.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.040]   Just to ever buy another HP refused.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:31.880]   No, never be able to set them up.
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:32.880]   Epson.
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:33.880]   Epson.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:34.880]   Love them.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:35.880]   The art is in his Wi-Fi.
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:40.480]   The workforce, if you need a bigger multi-function, I have a workforce at home and here.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.480]   And it's great.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.480]   Next printer I buy, I'm definitely.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.880]   And it's on the Wi-Fi network.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.880]   It's not connected to anything.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:45.880]   There's no wires.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:47.680]   It doesn't have to have a computer on or anything.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.160]   It just prints to it.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.160]   So it's like a fax machine.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.560]   Yeah, yeah, that's great.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:54.680]   It's really, it's really handy.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:58.520]   I'll tell you what, one of the few things I still print is airplane passes, boarding
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:35:59.520]   passes.
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:01.520]   I don't need to do that anymore.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.520]   I'm now using my phone for that.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.520]   I don't trust it.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:04.520]   The all.
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.520]   I don't trust it.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.520]   I actually agree.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:07.840]   I was that way for a while.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:08.840]   A second.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.240]   What's the harm of having a boarded?
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.160]   I might use my phone, but it's what's the harm of having a printed boarding pass right
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.160]   there?
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.160]   I have arrived.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.960]   I have discovered recently I'm on TSA pre.
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:21.120]   It is the greatest thing.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.120]   It is wonderful.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:26.400]   It is a blow through the whole line.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.400]   Everybody glares you.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.280]   They already know about me.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.640]   Thank you, NSA for the service here.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.240]   I say, who says this is a bad thing?
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.240]   Right.
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.680]   They can guarantee that I'm okay because well, NSA data and I blow right through.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.200]   All I do is take change and that's it.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.120]   Oh, so they don't scan you or anything.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.800]   You just have to take back.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:48.240]   You walk through the metal detector and play old fashioned one.
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:49.880]   You put everything on the belt.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.160]   Don't take out the liquids.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.160]   Don't take out the computer.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:54.720]   Don't do any of that.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.120]   Pull your through.
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.320]   But then you don't have to do this.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.920]   You don't have to do the body scan.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:01.320]   No, no, you need to get a little detector.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:02.320]   That's great.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:03.560]   That's really wonderful.
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:11.880]   Jeff, your number one too is that I'm happy about a regression to life before, but your
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.480]   number of the week.
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:23.400]   Well, I have so many.
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:27.640]   Google funded studies says that if we moved a lot of cloud apps, things up in the cloud,
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:30.600]   we'd save enough energy to power LA for a year.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:33.880]   But oh my God, what a waste of energy that is.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:38.160]   The internship made 18.1 million in the first weekend, which was fourth place, but about
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.840]   what it was expected.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:43.120]   It's the 50th birthday of ASCII.
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:50.840]   And finally, the only way to use on this one is that Google interns earn between $5,800
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.400]   and $6,700 a month.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.040]   That doesn't sound like an internship to me.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.760]   It's not like a job.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:57.760]   No.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:37:59.760]   Here's one of the time lapses.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.760]   This is Dubai.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:01.760]   Watch this.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:04.880]   Dubai really went through quite a growth spurt.
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:07.360]   It was just a lot of sand.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.880]   There's the Columbia Glacier.
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:10.880]   See it melting?
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:11.880]   Bye-bye, Glacier.
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:14.920]   This is a powerful statement about how we change the Earth.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.760]   Look at that.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:17.760]   Here's the Amazon.
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:20.840]   Yeah, I think this is great.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:23.680]   And it's all on the web.
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:26.840]   Obviously, you're not going to download all 52, whatever.
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:27.840]   52 terapixels.
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:28.840]   52 terapixels.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.760]   But you can hear it.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.520]   Let's look at Las Vegas.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.480]   Oh, yeah, that's fun.
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:40.520]   So just that little desert area there and then building it right up.
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:41.520]   Yeah, wow.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:46.280]   I thought Dubai was really interesting.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:48.280]   This is the beginning.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.280]   29 years.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.920]   Yeah, it sprouts those two.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.000]   Which, by the way, they never finished.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000]   Right.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.160]   That's cool.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:04.600]   That's time.com/timelaps.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.040]   And you did the number, so we're good.
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.040]   Yeah, we're done.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.040]   Yeah, we're done.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.520]   I actually was going to do cloud print.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:11.520]   That's why I had it on my machine.
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:12.520]   No, don't worry.
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:15.160]   I got plenty of tools.
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.440]   This is actually one for you, Gene.
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:22.320]   If you do get that HTC One Qualcomm, which makes the processor in it, the Snapdragon,
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.200]   makes a product that is free.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:27.760]   And I installed it on my HTC One called the Snapdragon Battery Guru.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.920]   Now, there's some debate over where the battery saving apps are any good or they're just another
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:35.200]   kind of task killer thing.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.880]   This does definitely help.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:42.520]   It watches what you do for a few days and then puts to sleep apps that you don't really
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:49.400]   need or gives you the choice of how each app should respond.
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:57.160]   So you can say, "Google Play Music, I don't want it to update it all ever or I do want
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:58.320]   it when I need it."
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.280]   That's the most intelligent choice.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:04.080]   That's the automated choice that it watched you for.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.840]   Or all the time, anytime it wants to get on and turn it on.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:12.120]   Most of these apps, you don't need Google Play Music to update all the time in the background.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.960]   Come on.
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.880]   So, I have it refreshed when you use it.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.200]   That can save considerable battery life.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:23.200]   This is free and it's from Qualcomm, but you do need to have an Android phone with a Snapdragon
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:24.200]   in it.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.560]   So it won't work on the Galaxy S4.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:26.560]   I don't think.
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:29.240]   Actually, mine might work on the US Galaxy S4.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.720]   Actually, probably would.
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:31.720]   You'll know.
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:32.720]   You'll know which one you need.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.320]   It says, "Incompatible with all my devices, but I've got to get the one."
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.440]   But when you get the one, it'll be less than the one.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.440]   It'll work.
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.440]   It's all one.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.440]   Nice.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.440]   Yeah.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.960]   Thank you, Gina Trapani.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.800]   Smarterware.org.
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:50.440]   ThinkUp.com to dotext.com.
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:51.440]   That's me.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.440]   That's her.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.440]   Thank you.
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.440]   Thank you.
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:55.440]   Android.
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.440]   All about it.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.540]   All about it.
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:58.840]   Every Tuesday right here.
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.840]   Thanks for that.
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:01.320]   All about Android.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.320]   Yep.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.320]   Tuesday nights.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.320]   What is that?
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.320]   Five.
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:06.320]   Five.
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:07.320]   Yep.
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:08.320]   5PM Pacific.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.320]   8PM Eastern time.
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:10.560]   If you're into Android, that's really a good show to watch.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.720]   And I apologize for all this Android talk.
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:14.400]   So we'll save it for the other show.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:15.680]   No, it's great.
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:16.680]   I get both perspectives.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:17.680]   Hi.
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.680]   It helps me prep.
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:19.680]   It's good.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.440]   You know, the more I use the iPhone, the more I like Android.
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.040]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis blogs at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:27.040]   He's also a professor of journalism.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.840]   And if I may plug these days.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.840]   Public arts.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.480]   Public this is more relevant than ever, folks.
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:35.280]   Talk about that issue of, you know, being.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.280]   Government transparency.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.280]   And government being the threat to us.
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.120]   You will like our guest on today's triangulation actually.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:43.120]   Oh, is that?
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:47.440]   Um, I got to find his name.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.000]   I don't have it right to hand.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.920]   He did a really remarkable TED talk.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:54.120]   Jason Silva of Brain Games.
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.120]   You know his name?
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.120]   Oh.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:57.120]   He's all about radical openness.
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.440]   In fact, he's got a, oh, I'll show this Vimeo because it's so good.
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:09.720]   He says really, and many agree, people like Ray Kurzweil, that evolution now is Richard
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:12.560]   Dawkins not happening in our bodies.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:19.520]   It's happening in our ideas that the progress, the human progress now comes from radical openness
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:20.520]   with ideas.
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.320]   The more we share them, the more we put our ideas out there and don't hold on to them,
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:27.080]   the faster the human race can progress.
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:29.800]   CDNSA is just doing us a favor.
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:30.800]   That's right.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:31.800]   That's all.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:32.800]   Radical openness.
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:38.440]   Our topic, Jason Silva joins us in just a few minutes on triangulation.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.760]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:42.360]   We do this week in Google one PM Pacific time.
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:44.600]   That's four PM Eastern time.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:47.240]   That's a 2100 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:48.240]   Please watch.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:52.160]   We loved it if you do, but if you can't watch live, you can always get on demand versions
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:58.920]   after the fact at twit.tv/twig or wherever finer podcasts are aggregated like dogcatcher
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.120]   on Android.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:04.200]   Is there a podcast app for the Pixel?
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:07.160]   You can just listen on the web, I guess, if you're in a Pixel.
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.160]   There might be a Chrome plug-in.
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.160]   I'll have to look.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:12.160]   Never thought about that.
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:13.160]   Of course, iTunes.
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:14.160]   Hey, thanks for joining us.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:14.160]   We'll see you next time.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:25.280]   [Music]
