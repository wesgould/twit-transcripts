[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.320]   a PM
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.520]   And a gene also blogs at smarter where calm I was watching the BBC. Oh, no the other day
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520]   Not my proudest moment and
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.520]   I
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.920]   Happen have a
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.920]   camera ready
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.640]   And they were talking about the Facebook
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.640]   Oh look
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.920]   Also
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.680]   Public parts of book about sharing information in the digital age Jeff Jarvis here. Look happy Jeff
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.680]   No, I wasn't
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.200]   No, I think that it's rather irresponsible of you to go into it
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.640]   Facebook has said that a few of its staffers laptops were hacked they fixed it no
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.920]   Usually it was out there and that's very clear here when you put up anything on Facebook or anything on the internet
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.280]   You better be expecting that it says shared with someone and that someone can share it on
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.720]   So I really think it's rather irresponsible of you to come along and say that this is a
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.840]   Course for panic around the world. I don't think what that started saying is a course for panic
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.960]   But I do think that people would be interested simply because Facebook hasn't these tries and we recently had you weren't mad at him
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.240]   It's better being hacked as well, and I got mad later. Yeah
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.560]   Does it get worse? Yeah, oh yeah
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.480]   Like Woody Allen right now any details of what sort of hack took place
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.720]   You were a few of the staffers
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.240]   laptops were hacked through a
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.680]   Now we're slight and there's nothing that was compromised many sites. No, I disagree with you
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.080]   This is irresponsible journalism
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.720]   Baby see you're talking to it's not Rupert Murdoch
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.840]   Here this interview shouldn't exist. I said that to your brain of you. I'll say it to you
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.400]   You're just causing a panic and there's no reason for it
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:44.440]   Look answer me that please. Okay. Listen, I don't think so
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.760]   You're meaner than you were to start cozy
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.720]   Technology is scary. Well, how do I have calls BPCC? Let's do a story about how wonderful technology is
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.560]   Opportunities it creates now. This is what you do you come over you say, huh?
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.720]   I'm not going to destroy technology is bad. Technopedic danger danger
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.240]   BS
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:14.000]   This is crap, and you know it. It's irresponsible journalism and I'm carrying on it. Okay, tough Thomas listen. We do appreciate
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.520]   Get rid of him get rid of him kill him
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:28.360]   You know what you heard you know what more than happy to hear it mr. Jarvis is just the nature of your language
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.600]   Okay, we do nature of mine. What did you say? Did you say F you said crap?
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:42.760]   You will never be on the BBC
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.800]   Again mr. Jarvis and thank you for your
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.560]   Jeff that should be like the front page of Buzz machine calm
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:01.160]   Now I mean it wasn't respect respect dude they called me and said do the story and I spent ten minutes trying to talk to
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.080]   Producer out of doing the story and said no, there's not a story here
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.880]   I mean there may be a story in tech world was there but there was no cause of damage to consumers
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.840]   There was no cause for panic. There was no cause for worry
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.400]   It was a non story and I tried and tried and tried and then I said to the producer
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.020]   I said you know what leave me out. I don't want to do so part of your story
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.380]   No, and then she came back called back. I said no, we want you to say this
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.740]   I said I'm gonna say that this is irresponsible and it's a non story and you shouldn't be doing it
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.540]   So they knew exactly what they're gonna. That's interesting. So it wasn't a surprise to them. Hey, you're up front
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.820]   I was in front with them. You the word crap and then and then they got and then yeah
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.200]   So then then he gets all pissy with me and you say the word crap when they cut me off F me
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.400]   I've been meaning to talk to you about your language myself. Yeah, I know I know
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.260]   That's that's right. I said, you know
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.220]   Of course, it's true
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.300]   And mainstream media always makes a big deal out of this stuff now
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.520]   Does it change your mind a little bit that we now know that that Facebook hack was actually only one of a series of hacks
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.140]   By an Eastern Europe apparently by Eastern European hackers who also got to Apple and Twitter
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.260]   Yeah, well to this extent what number one it does
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.700]   Remind in terms of the moment in time when they did that story. There was no story there
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.780]   There was no cause for panicking people. There was nothing there. Nothing was compromised there
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:27.980]   We we probably mentioned it in 30 seconds went on to the next thing right the truth is that that these these malware things happen
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.820]   All the time and yes, it happened to some big companies and are finally being a little more transparent about it as someone said
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:39.620]   I've kept it's a famous quote that that there's only two kinds of companies those that have been hacked and those that haven't admitted it right
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.420]   And so yeah, now we have something else going on that appears to be a little bit more
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.460]   But still it's a story in a technology world. It's still not a consumer story for the world
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.980]   Yeah, and they were playing it as oh my god your privacy's been violated or it might be yes
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.420]   The producer kept saying to be well all of your stuff on Facebook could be seen by the you know
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.860]   Could be see my other people said that's why you put it there
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:09.140]   Well, no technically it's not because Facebook and kind of implies that you have control of it
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:15.580]   There was no right, but there was no we know that we say to everybody if you put it online anywhere including Facebook
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.860]   You're always running the risk that it's gonna become public Facebook has a bad record of this
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.580]   Right, so so it wasn't a story at the time. It's a bit of a more of a story now in geek world
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.260]   So I respect Steven you to talk about it
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.340]   Yes, it is a story only because it looks like a concerted attempt to do industrial espionage
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:38.820]   A and B because it takes advantage of a flaw in Java that even the Department of Homeland Security has been warning people to turn off Java for weeks
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:45.980]   Right again, it's not a consumer story and a general broad audience world around and and I just got fed up with
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.780]   the techno panic angles angry and
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:56.060]   After I got off I just I hung my head it was late at night and I also said some more things like I
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.520]   Forget something like up yours anti on Twitter
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.380]   Being the anti BBC anti-bbc no I said kiss my ass anti
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:14.460]   And so it was not again. It reads Twitter Jeff. You've got to consider the proudest moment and people are going after me
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.620]   This is a journalist professor saying these things about it. Oh, so I got a bad
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.140]   I'm thinking oh now I got to deal with this again
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.740]   You know, it's one of these just leave me alone Saturday night. I wake up the next morning and end of the stadium
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:32.340]   Exactly a lot of that a lot of support. I'm sure egg me on folks. Yeah. No, we love it
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:38.740]   We want to see I think there's a certain amount of like what what what what might he do next? Let's watch Jeff blow
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:47.260]   It's great. I mean I thought the point was really it was was well-made and I definitely I have a problem with
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.340]   confrontation so I admire
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:56.420]   Folks who can be that articulate and do it, you know do it especially on the BBC and it's just fun to see the British guy get ruffled
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.300]   I'm too nice for that crap, but we need I need to I need to get better at that sort of confrontation
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.460]   So yeah good on you don't feel bad about it, but I'm trying not to do that and and it's yes
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.180]   It's in my DNA. It's there. I try to tamp it down. I'm not away. Crap's not a dirty word
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.820]   It's not apparently it is in the UK
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.460]   I said people are in our chatroom apparently say yeah
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.580]   It isn't considered okay to say on television the you in on the BBC. Oh, they say much worse on television the UK
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.420]   Much worse, but anyway, I know
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.900]   It seems like a mild word, but it's all in the years of cultural. Yeah, it's cultural
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:37.700]   And as somebody who has also from time to time lost his temper in public. I am I completely know how you feel
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:44.340]   It's one of those things where it was justified and you're glad you did it, but it's also embarrassing and it's I understand completely
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.340]   Yeah, I mean scobo went
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:53.860]   Batpucky on Matthew Ingram this week with Matthew just said oh well I switched off my iPhone and switched to
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.820]   my Android because the
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:02.100]   Notifications are better and scobo went off on them and I finally came into the scope
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.900]   I said Robert is this really the kind of conversation we want to have here and he kind of said oh, yeah
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:11.980]   Yeah, okay, you know when we need ironically I just saw a story yesterday that scobo's going to the androids phone. I know
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:20.260]   Like that by the way, I was like really that's a news story that Robert scobo's going to an androids phone that's like that's like
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.900]   What is the world coming to seriously? I don't
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.780]   Versus Android that old chestnut. I don't know
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.060]   It's an old
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:39.340]   Of it versus the New York Times. I'm so tired. Yeah, that's so yesterday now, but you were quoted the okay
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.340]   So it's not yesterday yet
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.140]   Because finally the Times ombudsman
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:50.620]   Was really great the public editor more what's your name? Maureen Margaret Sullivan Margaret Sullivan. That's right. She's quite wonderful
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.660]   And she tweeted you guys had a little tweet exchange over the whole it was it was just funny because
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.740]   You know here Elon Musk is just for the background of the story is a New York Times
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:06.700]   Reporter drove the car up the East Coast trying to show that you could do it all this way, but he ended up having problems
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.940]   He ended up got the car towed Elon Musk went completely that pukey on him and
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:19.540]   I can't figure out what other said it's a complicated story because David Broder the guy wrote the story is not an automotive critic
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.620]   he is a
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.900]   Energy reporter from Washington DC
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.220]   Tesla went to him and said hey, you know
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.300]   We we think it'd be great if you did a story to kind of match a story
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.900]   We had done earlier on the west coast about a road trip in an electric vehicle because we have the large
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.900]   They're trying to promote the fact they have the longest range
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.900]   he now
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.660]   Margaret kind of
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:48.660]   Punted on this one. I thought I thought so too. I agree and I think Margaret is very brave and she does great things
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.420]   I think she punted and basically said that well, they're both right. Yeah kind of
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:13:01.100]   Broder did certain things she kept she criticized him for not taking better notes, and that's of course a serious criticism for a reporter
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:06.420]   notes are what that's your defense those those things you write on a piece of paper. That's your defense and
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:12.380]   Everybody ought to take note now that companies have as as Tesla does
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.140]   They're monitoring it. They know exactly what he did. So they said here's the data. Here's what he said
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.300]   He did this is what he actually did they don't match
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:26.460]   I think Musk was a was a little bit inflammatory in what he wrote. I don't think Roger was show
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.380]   If I were gonna spend that amount of money for a car and that's the kind of customer service
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.420]   I'm gonna get when I have a problem is as everybody said it was the Apple equivalent of you didn't hold it right
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.260]   But others pointed out that if he had read the manual
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.460]   Instead of calling Tesla and saying what should I do because they didn't give him good advice?
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:49.780]   But if he had read the manual he would know exactly what to do. I think the most of salient point is it's an electric vehicle
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.780]   You shouldn't it's not for road tripping
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:58.540]   But it was but again, it was Tesla's that was their idea idea it was also a very very cold day in the US
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.820]   Day of the year of the US I mean in the East Coast right and so you couldn't get up
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.460]   So anyway, so Margaret Sullivan wrote this piece and she's a really really good public editor
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:11.540]   Respectful a lot of the talk tell us about that role because the Washington Times seems to be eliminating their ombudsman post
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.440]   There times times isn't you non-spidsman. No, we don't
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.220]   Reverend moon
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:23.140]   What what is that role and when did it happen and and why is it going away at the post?
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:29.780]   At the post it's money. You're on simple that it's it's it's a body and can they can they get a reporting post in there
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:35.520]   Whereas at the times especially after Jason Blair the faking reporter and other things the the times is needed one
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.380]   They hired I think this is the fourth or fifth. It's it's a fairly recent
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.180]   vintage
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.300]   Margaret came in and she's from the Buffalo evening whatever
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.860]   Paper owned by Warren Buffett for many many many years and I thought oh a traditionalist comes in
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:59.020]   She won me over won a lot of my fellow geeky guys like Jay Rosen and Emily Bell over very quickly her role is to not be
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.220]   not represent the times but to
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.700]   represent the readers represent the readers
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.500]   But she works at the time and she's changed the role a little bit
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.340]   So she doesn't just try to answer readers questions or readers complaints
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:17.580]   Instead she takes on issues and she was a perfect example wasn't it was a great example
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.820]   Yeah, so she she said come out right about I don't know what's going on here
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.380]   I don't know but I'm gonna watch it watch me
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.460]   I'm gonna ask she try to get ahold of musculated and return the call she made that public he did
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.140]   Back and forth so then she writes the column that basically kind of says
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.340]   Yeah, you're both kind of messed up a little bit and the reporter should on this sort of that
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.020]   So Elon Musk then comes on a tweet and says my faith in the times is restored
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:43.700]   And so I just retweeted that and said well that was easy and and Margaret came in and just put on
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.940]   exclamation points, you know this
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.260]   It's been it's been quite thicker puffle because the interesting thing about this too is I'm gonna get in trouble for saying this
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.180]   it's been
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.220]   really a parallel of Apple fanboy versus
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:03.540]   Like and Tesla's a new Tesla's new Apple for sure. It really is so that what happened is that there becomes this this this
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:10.060]   Emotional that's right. It's good critic being critical of Tesla in any way is considered
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:15.360]   To be apostate you're not you know, you're violating their you're a heretic
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.260]   Yes, yes, exactly. It's a religion. I do I saw a picture of Bradley horror
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.220]   What's with his guys? I'm thinking I ate by a lot of these things of course the truth is I can't afford one of these things
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.540]   Never will be able to afford one of these things and I see a picture of Bradley horror
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:33.100]   What's with his little road trip and I and I have to admit I got gadget lost again and and if only it's we're on Kickstarter
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.100]   I'd be ordering one, you know
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:40.240]   What has to happen is I have to sponsor the show and then provide cars for each of us so that we could talk
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.540]   During the spot. What do you think deal make that happen? Please?
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:51.300]   I've driven in the test last one of our viewers came down
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.180]   It took us for a ride and it's amazing vehicle. I'm very impressed with it
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:02.500]   But I think you know despite the fact it has more than 300 mile range because it's got a lot of batteries in that thing
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.140]   You shouldn't assume that you could just get in the car and drive
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.780]   Well, but but Tesla put in charging stations
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.100]   Yeah, I think 200 miles they're trying to promote these superchargers and their fast superchargers right?
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.940]   But that's a little misleading because it takes an hour or so
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.940]   I mean, it's not like going to a gas station
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.340]   Precisely precisely and and one of them is in a you know a horrible rest stop on the turnpike
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:27.900]   Which is you don't want to spend yeah any more time than it takes to urinate there our friend David Prager has one
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:33.060]   He was on the list early on and of course I've driven in the earlier Tesla's the sports car
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:40.980]   And I think they're very impressive. Are there really that and they're kind of the as good as you can get with an electric vehicle
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.500]   And current technology. I mean, so I don't follow cars at all
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.980]   I know you really very little about this car
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:52.300]   But I have to tell you the fact that this person couldn't go for a ride or people were saying that this person should have this reporter
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:57.860]   Should have read a 30 page manual turn me off. I was like, I don't want to read a manual to drive a car
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.300]   I've been driving for 15 years. Well, you have bad news
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:07.180]   It's not a gas vehicle. So everything you know about driving is different
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.540]   Yeah, you do need to read a manual
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:16.140]   It's not a long manual, but it is not a gas vehicle and so when you treat it like a gas vehicle you're gonna
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.480]   Know what's gonna happen next of course is you'll get a self-driving
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:25.900]   Electric car and then you can go back damn well better read the speaking of which Leo and the one down at the bottom of other
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:33.020]   There is a it is will only work for video, but but there is a computer simulation of an intersection with self-driving cars
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.020]   It is mesmerizing. Oh
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:42.580]   Let me fire that up while we can and it is really this is a media story and because of Jeff and Gina and my
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:48.380]   Intu crest in media and Jeff's expertise in media. We often talk about media on this show. This has become in a way our
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.740]   Show so these are these these cars are crossing the intersection. Wow. Look at that
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.580]   This is this looks like this looks like Rome on a busy day. I was gonna say Paris
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:02.460]   Yeah, this is like but they don't it's not even around about they're just going in and avoiding each other
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:09.140]   There's no stoplights nothing Wow and it works because they're smart and they know what they're doing
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:15.180]   Unlike us. They've even got cars turning left through traffic. Yeah, I love this
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.020]   It's it's but it's yeah
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:22.100]   It's just can't wait great thing is people in the comments below it on my posts were just saying you know
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.620]   People are gonna scream as this is going on. That'll be fun
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:31.220]   I'm a computer driven car taking over and knowing better than you do is so freaky to us
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:36.620]   You know what they're gonna have to draw the shades. Yes, because you're absolutely right if you're in that car you go
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:45.500]   And if you do hit the brakes you ruin the whole thing right cause an unbelievable. Yeah
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.180]   Isn't that fascinating that is really neat
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.180]   I love it. We all get used to this
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:57.820]   Well, I'll just kind of be sitting in a car checking our email as if nothing was going on as if we weren't driving right into
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.820]   I hope it happens in my lifetime
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.980]   I really do it will happen in your lifetime. You know, I have no doubt about that
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.660]   You'll be my age or older
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:13.140]   But I hope it happens in my lifetime. I would be looking no different from how she looks right now of course
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.380]   You look exactly you look better. Oh, I appreciate the voter
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.620]   Even I'm Cabernet
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:25.820]   Anyway, I just thought I we had to start with the Jeff Jarvis video because that's all anybody's had it
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.820]   Our chatroom has said to talk about all week. I was afraid of that
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:38.100]   But I commend you and I think it happens to me all the time. It's one of the reasons I'm really glad I don't work in mainstream media
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:44.460]   Is that mainstream media does such a poor job of covering technology and and does tend to sensationalize it
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:49.340]   We have a hobby be even we have a hard time when it comes to things like tracking cookies
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:56.020]   Separating the hysteria from the reality. So I mean, it's hopeless for mainstream media
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.780]   We
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.780]   Have our own fights over those things
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.300]   yeah
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:10.380]   800 what is Google's stock price now 800. Oh, it's over 800. Yeah, I wish I'd but every dollar
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:15.840]   I've gained with Google. I lost an hour. Oh it went down. Oh, it dropped 15 bucks today. It's under 800 792 bucks
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.740]   It opened at 805 bucks
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:24.700]   So that's profit take that's just profit taken that's people saying I think market down 108
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:30.500]   Yes, and also when it goes over 800. I'm sure their program sales that go. Yeah, I'll take it
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.380]   I'll take my profits now
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.860]   Google Glass is getting more widespread. We're gonna talk about that and for the first time ever
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:45.060]   Google has shown a video about what the UI will look like are we getting excited about glass? Oh
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:50.660]   Video got me. All right. I'll show in a moment. I'm excited

[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.100]   Yeah, Edda should go to this home in Missouri, right?

[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:04.580]   Not this was a different kid was it a different kid makes no this one has a set up in that event I planes that Larry
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:11.140]   Searching this part. I don't like don't fly upside down do not eat snakes
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:32.500]   Navigation even on the slopes. Yeah, yeah, well, you know what they're taking a page from the GoPro cameras
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:39.660]   a lot of first-person extreme video although ping-pong analytics
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.580]   Unless you're lean it done
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:50.460]   All right, I want it oh
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.660]   Good video this this kind of sells it because it okay
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.620]   So everything's going on in a heads-up display in the upper right hand corner
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.700]   I mean this this just got me
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:05.620]   This is a this is a hangout grandma's birthday. The grandkids are on the glass talk like right here
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.820]   We are in fancy Chinese food for reasons. No one understands
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:16.140]   There's a yeah, that's cool image look up on a jellyfish and text messaging
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.580]   With your daughter or your girlfriend depending on who you are
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.300]   Sharing it all right. I like it
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:31.140]   So a friend of mine emailed me this and said either Google has a wildly like unrealistic idea of what my day is like
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:36.140]   Do I get to do all those fun things?
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.140]   If I have glass on that that video blew me away
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:45.740]   I absolutely loved it and now I mean so my daughter's five months old so my and the way these technology has changed a lot
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.380]   But I focus a lot now on video
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.300]   Conferencing is a big deal and taking first-person pictures
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:56.100]   I mean the baby laughs and smiles all the time as soon as I hold the DSLR up she goes deadpan
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.260]   She's just looking at the big camera, you know
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.460]   So I saw the video on it's just like oh my god
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.540]   I cannot wait to play with that with with those glasses on because it's so kind of you know on obtrusive
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:13.740]   This article in the Verge says Google expects to launch or hopes to launch glass early 2014
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:19.020]   The developer edition is 1500 bucks those of us who are at Google I/O actually I wasn't there
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.540]   But Jason bought us
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.420]   We have the little I'm at the number 747
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.900]   So I'm on the I'm on the list
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.900]   I don't know when I'm gonna get mine, but you said Jeff you can get it in another way
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.480]   Well, no, that's I don't want to I don't want to kill Gina's tip
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:39.920]   Save it later in the show Gina will tell you how you too can spend $1,500 on a non-existent product
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.260]   Yes, that may or may not work
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.780]   Hey, I bought a 3D doodler. What's the difference?
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:52.020]   I'm actually really curious to know when the explorers like from when the I/O folks get theirs
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.700]   I mean I I you know I've got the number my numbers much higher than yours. I waited the last day. It's like 18
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:02.300]   Sign up to go to a demo session for them. Do you?
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:09.020]   Those demo sessions, but you didn't have to you just got in line like yeah, I mean gave him a credit card
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:16.420]   Importantly gave him a good you didn't have to go to that the most expensive piece of glass paperweight ever yeah
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:23.900]   Did we did we I don't think that we gave a credit card. I think Jason didn't have to pay him you just you promised
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:28.180]   Well, no, I guess that makes sense because they don't they they're not gonna dead, but no, it's alright
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.180]   We don't know bother Jason. He's busy
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.580]   It just makes sense because they're not they're not gonna take the money out anyway
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.340]   So what they'll do we did not give him any money Jason says no he didn't give them anything
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.620]   Yeah, anybody out there who has buyers remorse
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.260]   Just take it
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:48.020]   I'm sure they're just gonna charge your Google account right wallet account or even if not
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:54.740]   I mean they're gonna say hey if you want your your your in line your numbers up. Do you want it right exactly that's gonna solve for an eBay?
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.620]   Well, that's it. That's what I figured is that I guarantee I can make money on a day one
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.300]   I can flip it. I'm not gonna do that
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.860]   But if if I had buyers remorse I could always do that I could always like it's not to Jeff for 2000
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:11.340]   It might actually I don't know if I might violate the terms of terms of use. I mean
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:17.540]   Tracking yeah, it's the developer versions the preview version. They probably know which one is attached to your email address
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:24.340]   So I don't know how that'll go. Yeah, but I don't I don't I don't I don't so people are saying well Leo
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.340]   Why are you so negative?
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.300]   I
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.300]   Find this hard to believe that's why
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.420]   And I think it's gonna look really dorky when you wear them
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:39.860]   And I it could very well be annoying and it could be like the Steve Martin invention in
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:46.580]   The what is it the the movie the jerk where he invents the glasses with the handle?
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:51.980]   It's really great. Nobody bends their glasses and then they realize later that makes everybody cross side and
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.660]   He gets sued could make everybody cross side
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:05.140]   Life magazine picture of the theater all the people wearing three v glasses be very like well like that well
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:10.300]   Here's here's all I'll ship it to you right now on the the chat for the for the doc
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.660]   There's the link. Yeah looks just like it
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:22.220]   This is from your Google+ account. Yeah, gosh, you should be able to click that it should be a live link
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:27.100]   You're kidding me. It's not yeah, so I know you can't see that well, but yeah, but it's just like that
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:33.020]   It's gonna be we're gonna see a whole audience filled with people wearing the Google and the year 2050 will look back and laugh. Yeah
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:42.220]   I understand that it's it's not acceptable in this crowd to poo-poo any brand new technology
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.780]   But you know we should embrace and say everything new is great, but I'm
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:51.700]   I'd like to try it for a while before I see it. I'm course are we ordered one because I want to try it
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.220]   Yeah, it's tough
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.900]   It's tough to pass judgment before you try it
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:01.100]   But I think that it's totally reasonable to pass judgment to look at the way people look wearing it and say this is gonna be a weird
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.860]   Fashion, you know the segue was really cool
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.940]   People said they're gonna
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.260]   Bill Gates said they're gonna change the way that or maybe with Steve Jobs
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:12.860]   They're gonna change the way they build cities because of this thing and then we got them and we stood on them
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:18.460]   And you looked like the most idiotic dork on one and it's still cool. It's still great
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.800]   But because you look like a dork riding one
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:28.580]   Yeah, but Leo who people now walk down the street see me to talk to themselves and no one's bothered by that
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.940]   Yeah, so that's right. There's no I don't think there's a rule
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.260]   Right, but I but there's the potential. There's the high potential
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:41.780]   That look wearing these will be considered the nerdiest of nerdy things to do well, and that's badger water
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:48.540]   And there's also the dare I say creep factor where you're talking to someone
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:54.200]   Oh, yes, right. Someone who has them you might feel distrustful of them or say like are you recording me?
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.460]   Are you taking pictures of me? You know, I mean that holding a camera up is a social thing
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.460]   I mean it's a signal right like I'm taking a picture
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:07.300]   This is something historically Google's never been good at which is because they are such nerds themselves
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:13.340]   Understanding how something's going to be look in society and read in the real world
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:19.100]   True, they know the effect on norm right I imagine the remake of taxi driver. You're looking at me
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.660]   Me you glass at me
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:29.860]   Yeah, cuz I mean the presumption is there's this guy is not only looking at me and talking to me
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:34.700]   But he's looking at his screen at the whole time. How rude is it if if I talk to you?
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:40.620]   And I'm holding up my phone while I'm talking to you like this is this considered rude so Gina
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:45.100]   I mean it's good to say that you're not having a better conversation than you are with me
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.140]   Who was to say where that norm is gonna settle out?
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:54.220]   We don't know yeah, I you think it'll be okay consider okay might be
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:59.900]   How many how many groups of teenagers have you seen together standing as if talking but not talking to each other they're on
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.740]   That's their norm and who am I to say that's wrong?
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:11.740]   No, I'm just saying it may not be accepted in society and maybe it's not up to us, but it may be people just go
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:16.420]   You know if the new off the record is gonna be like hey, can you take your glasses off? Yeah?
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.860]   Yes, that's right
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.460]   You're not allowed in a lot of buildings with a camera phone
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.580]   Well, you're not gonna be in a gym with these things on
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:30.860]   There's another one. Yeah, I can't take in theory. I can't whip out a camera phone in the locker room
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:35.140]   Well, but remember that at first I do when camera phones came out get some of my best pictures
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:39.860]   They were forbidden in gyms you couldn't carry them in supposedly right that never happened
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:44.480]   Just obviously if you if you whipped one out and started taking pictures you're gonna get mama get the crap
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.300]   This it depends on the gym
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.500]   Yeah, well, that's true too. This is about
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.700]   Norms right in the dusty norms, right?
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:03.860]   I always tell my Kodak camera story of of fiendish Kodakers lying in wait with a fear in the 1890s
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:08.060]   But when I did a spiel on this recently about new norms somebody said well
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.820]   Yeah today if I'm walking with my you know
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:15.460]   If you're walking with Edda in a park and somebody comes along and starts taking pictures of of her
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:22.740]   Freak right nothing new technology it has to do with the norm the accepted norms that we get to people aren't gonna
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:28.660]   Just take a picture of your daughter right nine to five Google says that to get its products into more hands
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.060]   Google will open its own stores by the end of the year
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:35.220]   But I don't think there's a coincidence that that's timed to coincide with the release of glass
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.220]   I think that's what these stores are for
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:41.260]   Exactly what these stores are gonna be for right for people to come in and try glass no doubt
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.980]   I mean the timing sounds right and they need it's not gonna be something that you will buy on the internet
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:52.540]   Exactly well, but but also Leo. I don't think it's gonna be gonna be fulfillment places my my theory about this and it's just a theory
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.740]   I had no basis for for saying this but I think
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.620]   we're
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:04.020]   physical retail space goes is toward marketing over fulfillment right showroom and
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:11.980]   I'm gonna bet that Google is going to look at this more as a showroom for the world of Google
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:20.980]   Then a way to sell you, you know a thousand Nexus 4s because they also don't want to end up in channel conflict with all of their
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:27.700]   Suppliers and retail chains their suppliers retail chains for this right that they could really piss off Samsung
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:33.740]   By doing this but they can say look at the wonders of Android look at it on all these phones
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:40.660]   You can play with all the Samsung phones and the Motorola phones next to each other. I just feel that's where they're gonna go
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:47.740]   It's just not just about selling Nexus 7s. It's in their interest to have you be a better Google citizen. Yeah
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:54.480]   Yeah, we were talking about this last night on all about Android and I think I think the thing that I love the most about the idea of a Google
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.480]   Store is it is if they sort of
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.820]   Model it after the Apple store
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:03.580]   Which is basically what Microsoft did that there'll be you know the Google geek bar where you can go and
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:08.820]   Bring your customer service questions and that is just I mean, it's let's face it. It's funny
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.220]   I mean Google's never really done imagine Google doing like meet space customer service
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:19.260]   Imagine the line of people going like my website doesn't rank high enough anymore, but they should do don't you think that's a
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:24.140]   Important that's a good thing for them. Yeah, I think they need a public face. They do they do
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.780]   I just I just think it would be funny
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.140]   I mean you can certainly imagine classes like here's how to live in the cloud
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.380]   Here's how to like live your life with a Chromebook and an Android phone
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:38.060]   You know you can you can absolutely imagine that the way that Apple does kind of those free classes in their stores
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:43.720]   That I think they can absolutely use and people with it got plenty of content just to talk about
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:48.700]   Chromebooks and all that we were also talking on a l-v-and-in your last night chat actually pointed out that you know
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.700]   Google doesn't have that many products
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.460]   No, it's a Chromebook it's a nexus
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.900]   Chromebooks or it's glass
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.620]   glass
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:03.620]   But it has but it has many products virtual products and if you can get help to really learn the wonders of Gmail and Docs and maps
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:10.580]   And now and all these other things that's in their interest. Yep. Yep. Yep. Also
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:17.780]   If you if rumors are to believe Apple making a kind of serious commitment to an eye watch or some sort of wearable watch
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:24.180]   Does that validate Google strategy and is a watch better than wearing a pair of glasses discuss?
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:29.340]   Professor professor Jarvis
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.460]   Glasses your
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:37.320]   wearing glasses that said that what the being near your eyes creepier than being on your wrist
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   Which I think is insane it's more useful
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.020]   Which is by your eye. I think so I think it's a lot more useful
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:49.140]   And and I think that it's a quantum leap ahead of the idea of wearing something on your wrist
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:55.860]   But it depends on what it does and why it's there. I don't I think that the fact that they're both wearable is really
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:03.620]   Coincidence. It's not a god. We got to try to find trends at everything. It's not a trend in wearable technology
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.340]   it's it's
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:11.500]   Both these things do potentially break the notion of the screen and the keyboard and
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:16.220]   And and have other impacts but just because you wear them. I don't think is the interesting thing about them
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.520]   I think they're probably gonna do very very different things
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.340]   I have well
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.020]   I have a point to that in that
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:26.560]   Your watch is a completely different user experience than your glasses
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.100]   Because you have to speak to your glasses and when I saw this story on reddit
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:38.340]   There was a lot of people in the comments first thing they brought up was what can you say next to someone wearing glass and say okay glass
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.220]   and Google search, you know
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.900]   Mother Teresa and then BAM, you know, it's like
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:50.300]   the user experience of you know touching and being able to physically control a watch
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:56.300]   Versus the outside experience of needing to speak to your glass is very different
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:00.620]   But also what we saw the idea of the input of of the glass to you
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:04.940]   When you have two different inputs you to put this up here and find I don't have to yank out my phone
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.420]   I can look at a screen here or it's there all the time
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.900]   That'll be interesting
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:13.060]   What about a hawk says we should get a net connected nose ring
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:20.220]   So from a fashion perspective I would go watch right because I don't wear glasses
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:23.180]   It will be weird for me to wear glasses. It's just not used to it, right?
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.940]   Like I mean I wear sunglasses in San Diego a lot, but I just I don't wear regular glasses
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:31.460]   So it's gonna change the way I look and that's completely from like a vanity perspective, right?
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:35.620]   But from every other perspective, it's definitely glass
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.540]   I mean for me glasses is gonna be about documentation
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.500]   taking pictures
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.420]   Recording and getting information very quickly and you know
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:47.340]   I bought the watch band for the little iPod mini and you know it was cute
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.740]   But if it's been so long since I've worn a watch you have to look at your watch
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:54.920]   You can't take pictures with you watches a pain swiping around a tiny little screen is a pain
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:41:00.860]   So the kind of the voice commands and the fact that it's just a heads-up display a constant heads-up display is definitely more
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.340]   Interesting to me. Although I do wonder just about
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:11.660]   You know, when do we have kind of a quiet moment where we can be in the world without you know
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.140]   Google telling me the what you know like being kind of up in my face
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:20.060]   I'm telling you can dismiss the the the cards. It looks like you can kind of dismiss the cards from your from your glass
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:26.380]   But um it feels like oh great like every time sorry mom every time my mom texts me like it's gonna show up right in front of my face
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.740]   You know
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.500]   So I kind of have that that feeling about it too
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.620]   But again, I just really want to try it really want to try it before I pass
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.300]   I do too talking of course, you know
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.900]   I was checking my Twitter and my email and all this too because I can't I can't just listen to one person because it's just not enough input
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:45.320]   I got my all my stuff going at the same time. I'm gonna go. Okay, start the recorders
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:50.380]   I'm gonna go out on a limb. I think this thing is a flop. I think it will come out. It will do all these wonderful things
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:54.580]   It'll be very very cool. I'm not saying it won't be and people like you and me Gina
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:59.260]   May very well want it and wear it just like maybe we rode segues around
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:03.940]   But ultimately nobody wants to put on glasses if they don't have to I'm wearing contacts
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:08.140]   So I don't have to wear glasses and it's gonna be considered dorky invasive
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:12.660]   And I think it will be a flop and I think one year from now you come back here
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:17.780]   You can play that recording and then I will either eat my hat or crow with
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:22.940]   Satisfaction, what do you think you guys want to go out on the limb and say we should do a long bet
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:29.260]   I'll do a long bet. I think it's a non-starter. I think Google's making this up at a whole cloth. Nobody
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:34.300]   I think the problem here is this little I think that the product itself Google Glass as a brand
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:41.220]   I don't know that Google cares whether it succeeds. I think what it what it is is a harbinger of of
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.500]   Screenless net
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.460]   coming I think what it is is a harbinger of
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:54.220]   the stock market demanding new products every few years and
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:58.740]   If you don't have one make one up and I think that the pressure
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:04.620]   From the financial markets and the news media and everybody else to constantly be changing the world
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:09.420]   Gets to companies like Apple and Google and they start making crap up that nobody's asking for
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:13.660]   Do you know what's your bet? I think it's gonna be a specialty item
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:18.260]   I think it's gonna be a lot more common than the segue, but I don't think this is gonna be an everyday thing
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.460]   So when I go to Google I/O
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:26.100]   I want to wear glass when I fought fly an airplane when I do trampoline when I'm at the kids birthday party
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:31.940]   I'm gonna wear glass on a regular workday. I'm not probably not gonna wear glass. I think it's gonna be one of those things where
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:35.660]   You know, it's like do I you know my my own vacation?
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:36.940]   Do I want to remember this experience?
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.660]   Am I gonna have that my inner new city that I don't know and I'm gonna need navigation and I'm gonna
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:44.020]   You know, I don't want to be constantly staring down at my phone. That's when I would wear glass
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:51.300]   I mean right now so the price what's it gonna retail for a grand right like 99 they're talking that's expensive
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:55.420]   I mean it's gonna be a signifier someone who is extremely techy with a lot of disposable income
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:01.660]   And and I think that that community of folks will probably wear it as kind of a specialty item at events and things
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.020]   But I don't think it's gonna be an everyday thing
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:09.740]   So I'm kind of in the middle. I don't think it's gonna be as much of a flop as the segue all of the segue is a novelty thing, right?
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:15.060]   It's not a flash the cops at the airport drive around segues all the time is far from a flop
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.980]   mall cops and city tours mall cops and city tours
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.340]   They'll be wearing glass as well, so
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:27.020]   Common in the same but the segue but certainly not an everyday thing. I don't think it's gonna be a huge hit
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.380]   I think that this is gonna be a kind of a slow
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.060]   thing and I
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:36.740]   Mean again, I'd wear them if I'm gonna if I'm gonna be on the great wall of China. I want to have glass on
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:39.620]   Really? Yeah, yeah
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:41.260]   When I went to China
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.980]   I mean, you know from doing anything kind of interesting if I'm going for a ballad air balloon ride
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:49.820]   I absolutely want to wear glass wouldn't wouldn't you wouldn't you want to be able to stream it or
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:53.220]   Ice dream everything I'm shocked
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.580]   Yeah, I just I just think it's a bad form factor
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.380]   You don't want something pinching on your vision, especially if you're at the great wall of China
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:04.540]   You want to take it in if you pull out a camera you'll take a picture with the camera
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.700]   You don't why do you want it on all the time?
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:11.660]   I mean, I spent my entire trip in China with my camera in front of my face or my camera phone taking one
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.580]   Yeah, this would make me enjoy the trip warly, huh? Right?
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.020]   I wouldn't have to be like well
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:22.580]   It's a camera strap or my batteries and and all that stuff. I just found people in the chatroom are saying I'm jaded
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:27.100]   I'm bored with technology. I'm not the least I love technology and I see stuff that excites me all the time
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:31.900]   But I have to call I have to call it when I see see something that's just doesn't make any
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:36.740]   I can be two use cases here two odd use cases
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.380]   first
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:43.140]   Well, how did we get to see the meteor falling out of the sky so it's
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:48.900]   Dashboard camps. Why do the Russians have dashboard cans because they have crooked cops. They all record it
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:54.520]   What does this allow it becomes an amazing constant collection of who think we know G
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:46:01.300]   Yeah, we're gonna record you driving around all the time how boring can you be but there was a single use that ended up with side uses
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.820]   Right so you know, I think there's something like that
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:09.980]   Second eight one of my students in the entrepreneurial program this term we got a photographer named Andy cropah
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:16.260]   I don't want to give away his full idea, but what inspired his idea was that his mother had Alzheimer's and
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:20.460]   Had trouble remembering her day and and he looked at all this
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:24.000]   This trend toward trying to record your life
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.100]   Well rather than being some Microsoft geek who records your life
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.940]   What if you're somebody who can't remember your day and records your life and
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.100]   You can get it back. What if you're a cop?
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.420]   You can have that on it's gonna freak us out a bit
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:40.620]   But you know, hey, it's public. What's this that I can see individual use cases cropping up like the dash
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:41.980]   Board cam
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.300]   That kind of lead the way to other uses
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:50.980]   Yeah, yeah, we're definitely more bullish than
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:59.700]   All right one year from that chat. I want you to pull this tape out
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:05.180]   Right, actually, I don't know if it'll be out of here. I think I put here's another prediction. It won't be out of here
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.820]   Yeah, that's true. We're talking fall of 2014 at the earliest
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:13.300]   This product itself will not be a hit oh
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.660]   I well we're in agreement there but but
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:22.740]   This will be the harbinger of surprising things to come. I think wearable computing makes sense
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.740]   I'm not I'm not against wearable computing. What's hard to figure out as a form factor
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:29.780]   I don't think the why watch is gonna be a hit either. I think that's for even stupider
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.420]   Well, you also have the what's it looks see?
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:38.420]   Yeah, the look see I have a look see that is really dorky. Yeah, it is
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:43.780]   I bought a look see to try and it's a camera that goes on your temple
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:47.220]   It's now the problem with that. It's giant
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:54.260]   Yeah, I don't know what wearable computing should end up looking like to be honest student went and he ordered
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:48:01.700]   Digital camera lenses from some hunk Kong supplier of some sort and he was amused he came in with the box
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.620]   And they were like to them in a bag. Yeah, and they were smaller than little legos
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:11.860]   Yeah, oh lipstick cams are cheap and easy and widely. Yeah, she's so you don't need to be wearing whole glasses and things
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.820]   You know, there's other other use cases. I think
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.220]   thought
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:20.980]   Actually think believe it or not the smartphone is a pretty good form factor
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:26.500]   I don't think we've seen the end of the line on smartphones and and you pull it out when you need it
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.180]   We could do augmented reality if you really want to look at the world through a screen
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:36.580]   I don't know. I still I still have a hard time. Maybe this makes me really old. I have a hard time seeing
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:42.180]   Especially young people all standing around together staring down at their phone. What do you mean? That's all they do
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:47.700]   Oh, I see you don't like it when you see that right? No, I don't it makes me like it. Well, this is the same thing
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.700]   You're just hiding it
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.700]   It's just stealthier
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:58.900]   You're right. So you're just your eyeballs are focusing on the heads up display versus the person right another reason that it's not going to succeed because
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:03.140]   You think you're bothered by kids looking at the phone at least you know what they're doing now
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.980]   They're going to be looking at you with a glazed expression
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.620]   How do you feel when somebody's talking to you and looks over your shoulder the whole time?
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:10.500]   That's what you're going to see. Well, that's what they do it to me. Anyway
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.900]   They won't be looking at you. They'll be looking over their shoulder at their googled glass
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:21.700]   But look at it. No, my Leo is that now you you both got enamored when when amazon when amazon when android came out with
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:27.380]   It's it's notifications. Yes. I'm just a one-phone guy. Yes. You were enamored of that. Love it. Yes
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:32.580]   And you but what would you have to do? You had to pick up the phone you had to turn it on and swipe your 40 different ways
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:37.860]   And then you had to go like that and then you said oh look the notifications right which is fine
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.980]   It was a time in control. It was a big step
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:45.140]   Beyond what it existed before which was you had to actually go into a program, right?
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:49.700]   Well now what imagine if it is suddenly in the corner of your eye you got a little notification
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.500]   I don't have to imagine because I have it on my apple desktop
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.220]   So they took the notifications and they put them on your computer
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.700]   It is the most annoying thing ever
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.260]   When you
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.500]   I turn it off. I don't care whose birthday it's kevin rose's 38th birthday tomorrow
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:08.020]   Do I want to see that right now on my screen? I do not
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:14.500]   The problem of the use writing exactly and that's why in a world where streams become more prevalent than pages
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:20.020]   And there's a constant stream of information. There's going to be value in a company like google
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:27.220]   Uh or marissa. Yeah, who figuring out only those notifications that truly matter to you and make you actually do something
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:33.540]   By the way now the entire chat room is derailed talking about the fact that kevin rose's 38
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:40.980]   And this is my point squirrel we do not need more distractions
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:44.260]   Something shiny
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.500]   Um, I I think that what we need is ways to manage this stuff
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:55.220]   And I think just turning up the push is not a good thing and that's all this is dial up the push
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:59.380]   Stupid technology turns my light off
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.380]   um
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:04.740]   I'm alive. I tell you I'm alive
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:08.340]   Tell the bbc
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.340]   Right leo I absolutely agree
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:15.540]   Me and the streams of irritating notifications like meeting the streams of email and news and everything else
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:21.700]   Absolutely horrible. I think there's a great need for really really smart filtrane of your
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:26.260]   Yeah, that's why now is kind of interesting because now is pull but it's pushed into the pull
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.940]   So they're pushing information. I think I want but I get to choose when I see it
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:34.420]   Show title it's pushed into the pole. Yeah, I want I want
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:37.940]   Push pull
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:39.940]   push me pull you
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.740]   Or something wait, I'm
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.180]   Hold on. I think we're talking about a couple different things here. I'm confused
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.380]   So we're not talking
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:53.060]   There's there's the context of the notifications like the way that you get them and then there's like the quality and quantity
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:59.060]   Right, and there's those are two separate things. Yes, except I submit. I don't care what information this desktop pushed up at me
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:07.140]   It's still annoying that I'm doing something and it's and and and and oh s 10 continually tells me something's going on
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.780]   That's a
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.260]   Way about Google now because that's pulled push
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.140]   Right because you launched now. I say yes
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:18.500]   I would feel that way if my if my in fact I do feel that way
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.980]   There are some android things for instance
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:26.180]   When a call comes in now, it has a window that says this call came what do you want to do about it?
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.420]   I don't know what program's doing that that's annoying
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:34.820]   But the idea that I can pull this down or I can tap the now and see immediately what's going on
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:39.780]   That's I want it now and you what's great is they have put this together
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:45.300]   In such a way that that there and I love this that they're trying to give me information that they know I want
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.380]   So it's pushed
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:53.700]   But I'm pulling it but but jina's still right that for the right notification. You would want to be interrupted
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.420]   Right. Yeah, it's gonna say there's a tornado coming
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:00.020]   Right. There's some things but not everything
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.780]   Oh, I agree. I know we agree. This sounds like pretty easily configurable
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:08.580]   Like if the heads up display is just it doesn't show you anything unless you say okay glass
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:14.260]   I mean that that is something I would like but then why am I wearing a dorky pair of glasses?
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:18.180]   Well because because you can take pictures and you can I can take a picture. I got a camera
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.340]   Well, right. Yeah, no, but I can take a better picture
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.220]   And by the way, I don't know how but think about it
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:27.940]   This picture is always from the point of view of your right eyebrow
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.540]   Well, that's that's gonna be interesting right
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:34.260]   Yeah, what the video that's not a good picture
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:38.580]   Photographers spend a lot of energy thinking composing moving around waiting
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:42.580]   Every pictures from my right eyebrow. That's not good better
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:45.620]   But some cases better to have it than not you can still take your camera out
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:50.580]   I think it's not being from doing that but at that moment that that jina's wonderful beautiful little baby
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:55.140]   We still haven't met smiles at her. She can get that moment. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:54:00.340]   And you know or the opportunity I get to sit down with a mentor and I want to I'm gonna ask for some advice and say hey
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:04.980]   Do you mind if I record this, you know, which I yes, I can pull out my phone and say hey
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:09.860]   Do you mind if I record this uh, but it's a little different if I'm saying if I'm like, hey, let's you know
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.860]   Well, here's a question
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:17.220]   Isn't your mentor I mean isn't the presumption now because they can tell you're wearing a recording device on your eyebrow
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:22.180]   That you might always be recording and isn't there this now this a little bit of creepiness coming into this?
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:28.260]   Probably gonna have a red light. I predict a red light on it. What if what if I carried around a microphone? Not you all the time
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:32.180]   Would you just sit down and talk candidly with me if I did this?
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.380]   You do Leo. Oh, yeah
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:42.580]   Well, all right or reporters notebook what jeff if you walked around with a reporter's notebook at a pen poised all the time
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.900]   People would think what is he doing?
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.700]   People would people know what I do they they run away sometimes. Yeah
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.420]   I think there's a high creepy factor
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:56.900]   My sister was a minister in in uh, in Princeton the student minister was jeff stewart mcgruder
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:02.180]   Uh x white house burger squad whatever mixed in white house, right? Yep, every not a jail
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:07.540]   And so we're standing around religion and jail. That's right. I mean, uh
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:12.820]   What do you do? What do you do? And I say uh, oh, he works people magazine the guy
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:15.380]   Wept back. Yeah
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:17.620]   And and prac ran away as if burned
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:22.420]   You don't have to be having a google glass to scare people if you're a reporter
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:27.380]   Well, everybody now is a reporter, right? Right every blogger
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:32.980]   How many times you've been around bloggers and somebody says to them, uh, don't blog this how many times in class
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:37.940]   We have guest teacher people come in we did yesterday and they say oh don't tweet that
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:42.100]   And now imagine this jeff you're giving a lecture to your class of uh
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:43.860]   500
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:48.260]   Freshman and you dim the lights for the slideshow and all you see is these little red lights
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:54.420]   Blinking at you from everywhere. Uh, that's worse than a Beyonce concert. You know, no, no, no, no
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.980]   No, no, you see that
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.980]   This is like when I give a talk
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:04.660]   At at a conference of bloggers and nobody's typing and nobody's you want the feel hurt. Yeah, I want the I want the red lights
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:08.420]   All right. Well, what if you looked at and there's just somebody's glasses because they didn't want to stay for the lecture
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.420]   So they just left their glasses there
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.980]   I'm good. Good. I'll get them later
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:19.140]   I don't know. I'm now now I'm egging everybody on but I but I but I the more I think about it
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:23.780]   The more I wonder really is this something people are looking for or and and will real people
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:28.980]   You know go. Oh man. I've been waiting to wear a camera on my right eyebrow my whole life
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:36.180]   I predict I'm gonna make another prediction. I predict that in about a year and a half leo report is going to do a whole special show
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:40.980]   Yeah, I'll be wearing this Wow. No, that's true. Oh no doubt. I'm turning it on and it's gonna be live
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.980]   You're gonna see me in the bathroom
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:46.820]   You're gonna be live, baby
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.700]   Live
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:54.340]   Well, what happened to jestin tv that's how that started right jestin walking around and we were watching jestin's life
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.340]   That lasted about three weeks, right
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:59.060]   But it became a business for him. It became a business, but not him
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.740]   I don't even you do even see jestin it. Do we even know what he's doing anymore? No
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:08.740]   I'm saying with jestin same with jestin too jestin was she always wearing was she wearing a camera? No, see I'd watch her
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:13.140]   Oh, yeah, she wore a hat that's right. That didn't last either
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:19.300]   Justine they didn't want to see her worldview exactly. We want to see her. That's why jenny cam was inspired
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.660]   Yes, she she she did it longer than anybody
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:27.620]   Or the guy who started pseudo.com remember he put cameras in his apartment
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:30.020]   um, why did I josh uh
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:32.580]   Hera I interviewed him for my just Harris. Yeah
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:37.060]   uh and um you almost you almost went psychotic after we
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:40.500]   Even camera thought stop for three or four weeks or whatever it was
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.660]   Plus the movie we live in public, right? We live in public. Yeah
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:51.780]   I will of course you know that all three of us will be sitting here in a year or a year and a half wearing these
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.740]   I'm not saying i'm not saying we won't love them
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:58:00.900]   Where are Google glasses? They haven't arrived. Yeah, just like that. I'm not saying that I just don't I cannot see
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:06.100]   These is a mass appeal product by any means. Oh, no. I agree with that. I know I agree with that too
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:09.620]   Not mass appeal, but it is going to be a specialty thing. I don't know. I'm trying to think of
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:12.980]   I first broke forward the connect
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:18.340]   For example the connects sold very well sold very well. He's not being used at all
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:27.460]   No, that's a bad example. It's just gonna be no it's a perfect example. It's a very good example. It's it's
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:30.900]   These things seem so cool
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.700]   The first brick phone the first brick cell phones. Yeah
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:38.020]   We're seen as absurd who wants to be able to be called everywhere
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:41.940]   Uh, you look ridiculous. Okay. Just like do with a good with a note
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:45.940]   Um, and you know and on and on and they're wildly expensive
[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:53.220]   No, I'm saying you that and that's what i'm saying where when I say I think wearable computing is a good idea but what's what's really a challenge is
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:55.220]   How do you make that?
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:57.140]   A palatable and workable
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:02.260]   And I think in many ways because I carry this in my front pocket my cell phone is a wearable computer
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:06.020]   I mean it really is it's I I don't you know, you think about yourself
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:10.900]   You get up and go to a different room. Don't you bring your cell phone with you? Oh, yeah. Oh god. Yeah
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:14.740]   It is it is very much integrated into our persona
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:18.580]   So does it have to be on the body? Does it have to be glued to my head?
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.500]   Be easier sometimes no
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.300]   Did you ever see Jonathan Harris is the the whale hunt?
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.980]   No, what's that?
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.860]   Jonathan is a brilliant brilliant artist and developer
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:33.460]   Uh, and there's all kinds of projects, but if you look up Jonathan Harris whale hunt
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:40.020]   He put a camera around his neck and when he went on a whale hunt he took pictures at least at once every five minutes
[00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:42.820]   More if there was more happening
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:48.100]   And it is incredible. He wasn't hunting whales to kill them. He was looking to watch them. No, no, no
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:52.100]   No, he was with with Inuit going to do it. Oh my so you could see
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:56.740]   One of the things that you see a timeline of the activity of the photos when when the photos go whoa
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.340]   You know, what's happening right they got a whale where you see them
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:05.140]   You can also look at the colors when you see a bunch of red. What is it? They're they're butchering the whale
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.660]   um
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:13.620]   Absolutely fascinating of of seeing I mean he's a photographer and he took an actual picture and it's and it's good photography
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:16.260]   But it was the same. It was another idea of life recording
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:21.300]   But it was around a story and he found other ways to tell the story with this constant chronicle
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:26.900]   And it's amazing what this can do to change our view of storytelling. Yeah and witnessing
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.980]   Yeah, I think the professionals will have a use for I don't know I know I'm standing like Andrew keen all of a sudden but
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:39.780]   Leo I'll buy your glass. No, no, no, no, I can't get my glass. Don't get don't get your hopes up
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:45.940]   It's gonna be wasted on you fella. No, I need to understand this
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.980]   That you know me I'll wear it all the time
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:55.940]   But that doesn't mean anybody else will I want a segue. In fact, I'm waiting. I figured the use segue market's gonna go
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.660]   Pretty good pretty soon
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:02.100]   You can be able to get segue 500 600 bucks any minute now
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.980]   Of course. I'm the guy who just bought the 3d dude lure
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.180]   Now there's a product
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:13.860]   We're gonna take only 75 bucks. So what that yeah, this is for those who weren't watching the pre-show a pen

[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:22.020]   Melted plastic so you can draw stuff in the air and then it hard ways
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.660]   art art artens
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:28.740]   little program note because we do now believe
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:33.220]   That sony is going to announce a playstation for this afternoon
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:38.820]   We are going to shift triangulation back in our steve huffman will be our guest the
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:43.540]   One of the founders of reddit we talked with the lexus arhanian a few weeks ago now
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.540]   We're gonna get the other side of the story
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:53.940]   And but prior to that right after twig we will go to special coverage of the sony playstation for announcement because we do believe
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.460]   That they will announce the playstation for according to my sources
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:05.060]   Uh just a little program now we're gonna take a break come back with more our changelog coming up next and we want to give credit to the changelog composer
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:11.220]   Yes, we don't let me forget to do that. Okay, but first a word from citrix a new product. It's called
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:14.820]   Poteo P O D I O
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:19.060]   And it's impossible to describe but once you start using it as we have here
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:23.060]   You will never want to be without it again. That's why we're saying go start a free account
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:28.580]   Create a workspace and start having some fun with poteo. This is my poteo workspace
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:33.300]   Po look we all went in at work now, but we're all electronic knowledge workers
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:37.540]   No matter what you do you've got email. You've got documents. Maybe they're in google docs
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:42.340]   Maybe they're in skydrive. You've probably got spreadsheets and word processing databases
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:48.340]   And all of these disparate sources of information just kind of spread out the idea poteo is to bring it all into a central
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:55.460]   repository where you can see it. You don't have to give up any of your tools. You're still using them, but poteo manages them
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:03:02.260]   Plus you also have this activity stream where you it's it's caught like an in-house twitter basically share images links
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:06.980]   polls files with other people in your group create as many groups as you need
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:12.020]   To do lists. There are worksheets in all different categories
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:16.020]   You've got all sorts of applications some many by third parties
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.940]   A lot of people are using poteo in a lot of very interesting ways right now
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:25.140]   Um, but the the problem we're having and i'm having is how do you how do I describe?
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:27.220]   What poteo?
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.500]   Can do
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:35.060]   For you. Well the best way to do it is for you to try it. That's the nice thing. I have no outstanding tasks
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.940]   That's good. That's like inbox zero, baby
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.580]   P-o-d-i-o
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:48.500]   Poteo.com my strong suggestion is created at workspace as soon as you sign up create a workspace start inviting people into it
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.820]   whether it's you're planning a party
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:54.900]   Uh, Kevin rose birthday party or you're planning a
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.460]   Something more massive
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:02.180]   Maybe you've got a work project you're working on or you just need better communication in the workplace
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:05.620]   Poteo.com and now ladies and gentlemen
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.020]   it is time
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.020]   for the changelog
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:11.860]   the
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.860]   Google changelog
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:20.980]   We missed you Gina without the changelog this just ate this week in google
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:26.260]   I missed doing the changelog actually Chad if you reset the video you're sending me I can't I you're frozen for me
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:29.860]   But oh, that's okay, but i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna do a blind that's all right
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:37.940]   Uh, so this week the google search for android app updated with a google now widget. We saw this
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:42.500]   Um, we got we saw that there was a help page kind of released that that talked about the google now widget
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:48.180]   And then it was quickly pulled it's out in the the the google search app for android
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:51.460]   So you can just add the google now widget to your android home screen
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:55.540]   And it shows you kind of just the cards that you're used to seeing the weather and the amount of time
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:59.220]   It'll take you to travel home. Uh google now also got a couple of other updates
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:03.380]   movie ratings from rotten tomatoes real estate listings from zillow and
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.700]   New movie tickets functionality. So if you buy movie tickets through fandango
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:12.100]   You'll get a google now card telling you when it's time to leave the house to make your showing on time
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:17.460]   And then when you get to the theater, it'll pop up a qr code that you can just scan to go into the theater pretty cool
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:20.100]   um also
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:24.820]   You uh, kaleep kaleep catflautics have been added to google now sports as well
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:30.260]   Another update in the google search app for android is music search
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:34.740]   So there's that widget that what's this song widget, uh that that you've seen already
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:42.420]   That's been out since december that if a song is playing you tap the widget what's this song and it tells you well now in just the straight up google search app
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:46.900]   Uh, if you tap the microphone for voice search and there's music playing in the area
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.100]   Google now or google search will say oh, I hear music
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:51.300]   Can you tap the music button?
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.940]   There's like a little little music note and then it will tell you
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:58.820]   Uh, what song it hears and we'll give you the link to to buy it directly from from google play
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:02.020]   Which is which is pretty cool. I has it out before the show it works really well
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:05.060]   and finally, uh
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:08.500]   Data liberation that the data liberation team is hard at work
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:12.340]   They've got uh, they've added google plus pages and blogger to take out
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.420]   So if you go to google.com slash takeout
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:17.460]   You can export your blogger blogs as an adam xml file
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.980]   Which kind of old school blog xml, uh, uh, format
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:27.460]   And if you've got a google plus page, you can download html files or jason files of your h of your google plus page
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.180]   Uh content. So that's that's google takeout
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:35.220]   Bringing you making sure that your data can be liberated from google services and all kinds of formats
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:37.140]   That's all i got
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.140]   And that's the changelog
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:46.980]   So tell us about the composer of the of the changelog bumpers
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:51.460]   Um, well he sent us an email saying hey, I don't want to be a pastor anything
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.020]   But i'm trying to make a career for myself
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:57.220]   in uh, composition and music composition
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:03.700]   And I was wondering if you would mind if I put on my resume that I created the google changelog
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:09.620]   Uh, sound effect and I thought of course not we would love it. Be glad to do that
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:12.820]   And why haven't I been giving you credit anyway?
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:17.700]   So, um, but my problem. Do you have the um, it's a jesse weiner?
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.340]   Oh, how could I forget jesse weiner?
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:26.340]   jesse, thank you very very much for giving me one of the coolest the coolest and he did the beginning right
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:30.260]   He did the trumpets and the timpani is that his voice?
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:37.860]   I believe yes. He said he said that it was great to always hear him say it's the google changelog
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:45.060]   Right and you can check out his his website. There you go. Um, and w i e and er jesse jesse
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:49.300]   I want one before my rants. Um, okay jesse you have an assignment
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:55.300]   Jeff friends jeff rants. We have to we have to come up with something do that. That's good
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:59.940]   Yeah, thank you jesse and thanks jesse you can do it cut it at the end
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:05.780]   Well, we could do yeah, we could do is just like a blood pressure gauge on screen blood pressure gauge
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:11.220]   And watch it go higher and higher and higher jeff soapbox
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:17.300]   And the evilometer we talked about doing an evilometer evil ometer. Yeah
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:24.420]   I've had the is google evil conversation in a long time. That's a it's a positive evolution. I know I think it's just a given now
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.380]   Well, there's no debate anymore
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:32.020]   Oh, seriously that don't you think it's like what what's to talk about? Of course they're evil
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:35.860]   Oh, no, I debate us in every possible way
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:39.220]   Yeah, wow. Well, what do you mean they're not evil
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:43.620]   Are you saying they're not evil?
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:51.140]   In profit mongering. Oh, in the sense they're evil in the sense that they are a corporation
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:53.780]   designed to profit
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:58.260]   By selling our attention to advertisers or just like us
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:04.260]   And that they are
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.700]   very
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:11.940]   Publicly and openly gathering data to improve though that advertising that might be the evil part
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:14.180]   We don't we don't track people we can't do that
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:18.740]   They'll I just wrote a piece for medium. It'll be up later this week on defining the troll
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.780]   The troll is somebody says google's evil
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:24.580]   Just for the to get the rise out of
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.900]   It's all guy. You're all trolls. That's who you are
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:32.580]   Jeff, how have you been liking medium have you been writing there a lot?
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:37.060]   Uh, yeah, my my ex agent and I even though I'm mad at her for leaving agent tree
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:40.980]   Uh, kately is there as the head of content and you know, uh, have a bizzerk rate
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:44.020]   And so when I write on it, I wrote last night this piece
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:48.820]   I don't look it's up yet. And it's it is a truly elegant
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:54.260]   Uh format and it changes the way you're right just because of the environment of where you are
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:10:00.180]   Because the writing the compose field essentially. Yeah, I think it really is. It's so elegant and so easy
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:03.460]   We're talking about medium.com. This is f william's new
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:11.460]   Is it business? I don't know. It's uh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I know that, uh, gina and eel dash uh put up a
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:16.260]   google doc spreadsheet this last week of every new kind of
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:19.060]   Content creation tool there is
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:23.380]   And broadly defined he included courts and that which I would consider more of not a platform
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:27.140]   But just a content site but nonetheless, there's a lot of activity going on this
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.980]   But I don't think we really seen anything that
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:29.780]   that
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:37.380]   Advances the notion of content creation greatly medium makes it really elegant and and simplistic and are simple and pretty
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:43.140]   I think it's out of beta. It looks like I could post to it. You don't it was invite only, but now I can write something
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.620]   Yeah, um, they did a new design
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.860]   Now let me just get this straight
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:50.900]   I write a 2000 word article brilliantly thought out
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:54.740]   Article and I just I give them to them and they publish
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:59.700]   I think they're going to in some cases I can be wrong about this, but I think they're I think they're going to pay some people
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.300]   to write some stuff
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.300]   I don't know what the revenue in is
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.780]   Uh, that's revenue out
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:10.820]   Uh, but I I think that's an environment of quality. It's taking the model of twitter
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:14.180]   Which was taking all of our 140 character posts
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:17.140]   Uh and and making it long form
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:20.580]   Except that it could be more like a magazine in the sense that if he
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:27.220]   Commissions pieces right if he and Kate commissioned pieces and pay for them to have a quality place where you're around
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.820]   um
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.820]   You know, that's like, uh
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:34.260]   Uh, the guardian guardian's comment is free. You could just write it for it for free
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:36.180]   But if they commission you they pay you
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:40.500]   Can you comment on these posts or they just but they know they need to do that? Okay
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.620]   But the but the thing about it that's most impressive beautiful
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:50.580]   User interface is incredibly easy. You just type and then when you mark a word you have a very limited number of choices
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:56.260]   Uh, uh, two two font sizes bold italic link or quote. That's it
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:00.180]   And and so it's extremely simple and I wish that
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:06.740]   Frank the google would learn from that and then google plus give us a lot more power to do more within a google plus post
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:10.980]   Oh, it looks like they've added the they've added comments allow notes on your posts
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:14.900]   Oh, they did. Okay, when notes are on readers can add feedback to your posts that you can choose to make public
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:19.860]   So you now have common. Oh, I think those are the things to the side. They did it differently. Yeah. Oh, no
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.860]   I don't think is I saw the little reenbox last night
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:26.980]   So jeff you wrote the post but they published it for you. They like hit they hit the publish button
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:29.620]   Uh in this case kate asked me to write something this week
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:34.340]   Uh, and so it was gonna go up. But but yeah, I've in the past. I wrote a piece about um
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.740]   Um
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:40.180]   I helped me. I've written like four or five pieces for it and
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:43.540]   I
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.660]   I was curious about what you thought and how it was I like you know
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:51.620]   I like I love I mean, I love an eel to him everything as a blog. So that that's brought you was
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:57.220]   One problem here. I'm that I'm looking. I don't see a way I could search for jeff javis's posts
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:01.940]   No, if you go to collections
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:06.420]   I mean if I know what collection you're in i'm signed in
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:09.220]   Uh if you go to i m h o
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:14.420]   Um, so I could go to that collection and then maybe scroll down and find you
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:19.700]   Yeah, go to medium.com slash at jeff javis. Ah, so he is his twitter handle
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.900]   Uh, he's signing with twitter
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:25.300]   Uh
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:30.580]   But see my my you know, I'm I guess because I um, I believe in getting paid for my content. I just
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:35.940]   It seems like you're giving them something pretty special. Well, no, you see this is I write for hoffington post
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:39.780]   Why do I do that because they in their case they have a lot of distribution, right? So it gets more attention
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:43.460]   I mean, I love how it looks. It's gorgeous. Yo, the oh
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:48.260]   I don't want to tell you this but I would do this for free. You are doing it for free
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:55.620]   Oh this oh no, no, no, see I see I feel I would feel bad about doing that. I totally wouldn't now. I'm just kidding
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:05.220]   Oh, we know that we wear the negotiations just back and forth and oh, yeah agent her manager. Oh my god
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:08.420]   Oh, yeah
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:12.580]   Get you with all those extra brown m&m's now
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:16.900]   But this is maybe what's wrong with me because I wouldn't dream of asking you to do it for free
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:23.220]   Well, because you're a professional and well what is have williams a professional? Yeah
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:26.180]   You know, I see what you're saying
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:29.700]   If he didn't have a history of taking my content
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:35.060]   And locking it into his silo at twitter, I might not be so skeptical, but I am
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:40.980]   Oh, I'm turning into a grump. I'm sorry. I apologize. I I'm gonna stop it right now
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:46.180]   I love everything. I think medium is beautiful. It's got pretty pictures
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:51.140]   It's nicely laid out. It's formatting is good
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:55.060]   You're gonna have a curation problem. You know, it's kind of like quora
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.700]   It's kind of like that's the idea like quora. You just pump in content, right?
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:03.380]   It's in response to a question, but it's the same idea
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:07.220]   Yeah, yeah, it's true. There's there's a lot of content on chorus
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.980]   But people spend a lot of time answering questions
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:11.700]   They do I often have that question that that feeling of like well
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:16.100]   Why wouldn't I just write a blog post at least on my own side if I'm gonna work for free and I'll do it on my own
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:20.260]   domain for you know myself, but I think it's the community and I think with medium
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:25.300]   It's just a it's very much like the Huffington Post. It's a matter of kind of you know status
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:27.700]   But is there curation at all in this?
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:32.500]   I don't understand know that it's opened up. There was the sense that you were invited in right, but not anymore
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:37.380]   Right, it's like subtle. There's recommend there's recommended and then there's newest
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:43.300]   But in this case in the HBO girls
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:46.820]   Group it's the same thing. This is only four posts
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:52.980]   Well, that's the other thing right so I suggested a collection about Aaron Schwartz and there were four posts, right
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:55.300]   Yeah, and I'm gonna do a my idea
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:59.940]   I started a new collection around those trolls and the Amanda Palmer one which is about redefining rude
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:05.220]   And I wanted to try to write more on that topic. There's some very good writers out there, you know, it's like musician
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:09.460]   But if you okay so so like let's say I created a site that uh for musicians
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:13.940]   I said post your music here and we'll share it with the world. I guess that's like soundcloud
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:17.780]   Yeah, well, here's another way to look at a layout my space
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.420]   Yeah
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:22.420]   a blogger what
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:27.300]   Another way to look at it is in in my field. I've been arguing lately that
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.580]   We're trapped by thinking that we're in the content business
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:35.620]   And that all of our value is is intrinsic to our content and the content itself has value, right?
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:39.380]   And we talked about this the show before um, I get other value about to be an enough
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:43.300]   Interpost right because I and being here because I get more fame
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:48.900]   You know because people recognize me and see me and hear my gatherings and then I get gigs out of that
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.140]   There's other reasons to do things
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.140]   Yeah, we don't pay you you're worse
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:56.340]   Just what we want to pay you
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:17:02.180]   I make money on you. I make more money than I pay you well you should that'd be foolish
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:08.180]   That's actually not the case on all of our shows, but in this case, I'd make more money than I pay you
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:10.420]   But we also gave you uh
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:16.740]   Spontaneously gave you a raise as this show became more profitable. We said, oh, we're making more money. We're gonna kick in some more
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:21.460]   I don't know. I just maybe I'm maybe that's why I'm a bad businessman. I don't know
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:25.780]   I don't know
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:31.060]   I don't know. I wonder it's funny because I feel differently about spending an hour doing a podcast versus
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:35.060]   Two hours writing right. Oh, yeah, I mean, I guess yeah, I guess there's no
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:38.580]   I mean the only difference is you know synchronous versus asynchronous time, right?
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:42.340]   Um, yeah, we demand your time at a specific time of the week every week
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:49.700]   Right. I mean, there's some prep and you know, but the same with with writing it takes a long time to write a good piece and to do your research and all that stuff
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:53.300]   uh, I don't know if it's just the the web and the
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.820]   Is
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:58.420]   If there's a difference about written content just feels like it's it's free
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:05.860]   So we're just more willing to post it on reddit or quora or you know, wherever that we gets more eyeballs versus
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:09.380]   Um, you know where where it gets us paid. I don't know
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:14.820]   Microsoft scruggled campaign may be working. They say that half of their 80 million
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:21.700]   Users on outlook.com. I'm sorry 60 million outlook.com users now that it's a out of beta
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:25.860]   Are x g a former? I don't know how they would know this form. How would gmail
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:29.940]   Everybody is a former gmail user a former yahoo mail user a former
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.300]   AOL user. What does it mean? Yeah, I mean I use both
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:36.340]   Yeah, I hope they're not considering me one of those former
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:41.220]   Well, yeah, Microsoft is just turning into this whiny little thing like me
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:44.180]   Yeah google
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:49.860]   Sorry, go ahead. I dropped this in the in the rundown because I think it's interesting that the marketing campaign is
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:54.500]   Um, this is what google's doing to you. It's the duck. But go approach right like
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:19:00.180]   Google's tracking your stuff. They're using the creek back right the creek factor around google to sell there
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:07.060]   So if if this is true if this number is true, it sounds as if this is whatever. What was it 60 million people?
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:09.460]   Yeah, 60. Yeah, 60 million
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:16.340]   People who don't like the idea that if they mention the word mortgage in their email to a friend that they're going to get ads
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.340]   Sensads about refinancing
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:22.180]   Um, that's interesting. It's interesting if that's if that's truly the reaction
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:27.060]   I have a hard time believing that this is really but it's interesting that they hung a whole campaign around that
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:30.420]   and I wonder you know if there's an opportunity for competitors to
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:33.220]   to kind of
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:38.820]   Point out what google does and what their business model is if it's not clear to people like crystal clear and then say
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.900]   Well, we don't do this and this is what we you know
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:44.500]   We can't care about that Gina. I think you're right. I think that's part of what's going on
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:49.860]   And I think that what bothers me about that is that also gives kudos to the entirety of the internet business model
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.580]   And basically
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:56.820]   Microsoft has failed microsoft and news corp are failing at selling digital ads online
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:02.580]   And that's why they're switching to a paywall structure and they're switching to trying to cut down everybody else who's in that model
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:06.500]   And the ad model requires cookies and tracking
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.460]   And and there's other stuff
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:13.540]   And so yeah, you can yank down the other guy, but is that really a business model?
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:16.500]   I don't I don't
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:19.380]   I
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:22.820]   You frozen a very attractive
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:26.180]   I have no other kindly
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:33.620]   But what I think is interesting is the idea that that if people if everyone really understood how this all works
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.700]   And it's kind of crazy that at this point we don't I mean
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:41.620]   But but if if everyone understands how this works right the way that advertising works on the internet where it's it's based on
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:44.500]   Data it's data driven based on your behavior
[01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:50.900]   If the if the choice is if someone could pay for for privacy versus get free for ads
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:57.460]   I mean I increasingly hear from people who say, you know, I wish I could just just pay a little extra money and not get tracked
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:02.180]   Yeah, you're gonna say that they're gonna say that but I would not bet on that model
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:06.500]   Right if they you think paywalls are just they're not they're just they're gonna work people aren't gonna pay
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:11.140]   If there's free competition that's as good that's good enough if not better
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:17.380]   Right. I haven't used that one come. I've no idea how good it is, but I I love gmail. Yeah, I do too
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:18.980]   You can't switch me off
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.980]   fried gmail from my cold
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:26.740]   Yeah, what mike herself might also have said is the other half comes from how hot hotmail dot com refugees
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:30.660]   So there
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:33.460]   Oh, I had a good let me go back to it
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:36.420]   Sergei brin
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:40.100]   Giving a speech at google ventures ceo summit talking about
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:43.700]   How important it is to fail fast. This is kind of the new
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:48.100]   Accepted wisdom and startups fail fast move on
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:51.460]   It's a it's a long story that he tells but it's also a good story
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:55.620]   I'll sign up size because it is a 10 minute video which you can you can see at search engine land calm
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:22:03.300]   But the the story is that before there was google sergie and his friends created a pizza ordering site that involved
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:05.540]   faxing
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:06.580]   pizzas
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.500]   Orders to the pizza shop
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:14.420]   No phone calls required. However, it turns out pizza shops really don't check their faxes very often
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:18.500]   So sergie and his friends are sitting there waiting and waiting for their pizza
[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:23.220]   Um, he called him later and he was told let me check the fax machine
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:28.180]   No, he decided this isn't gonna work. So he got together with larry page
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:32.100]   Uh and worked on data mining and the link structure of the web and google was born
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:36.180]   He said he's glad the fax idea failed quickly
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:40.100]   So he could move on to bigger and better things
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:46.500]   Wouldn't it be sad if a great man a great mind like his was devoted to making it easier to order pizza
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:52.180]   I think I think it is isn't it? Uh, yeah, you know what maybe he's back to doing
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:57.380]   Google now soon with the pizza ordering service
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:00.580]   Pizza ordering okay glass pizza. Oh
[01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:03.380]   You just look at a pizza say I'll have one of those
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:07.300]   Domino's guy we get to watch him going around delivering the pizzas
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:12.340]   That's that would be interesting. Yeah, I do like I do like glimpse where you can see you know
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:16.660]   It would that would be a great thing for dominoes to send me a glimpse saying here's our driver
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:19.700]   He's on his way. Yeah
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:27.940]   I mean if you think that through though, okay glass pizza glass knows where you are at the moment where the nearest pizza shop is what your address is
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:32.580]   What your phone number is? I mean and what you like what you like right?
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:36.740]   What your friends like like what your friends like who you're with how much money's in your bank account
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:40.260]   You could that's where all the value is
[01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:45.940]   Order a pizza by saying okay glass like one pizza. I call it a pie. I grew up in brook with my
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:51.300]   No, no, no one calls pizza. I made a pie. You're a step short. You know your step short
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:59.620]   Glass here's your stomach growl. It says pizza. It's a push pizza. Yes pizza sandwich
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:08.100]   The day that pizza or push is pushed to me is the day I get offline entirely. Oh, no, that's the heaven
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:11.940]   Heaven Wow. I wanted a pizza and google just knew yes
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:16.340]   Will all be 800 pounds because we always want pizza
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:19.700]   Or imagine that you that we're all having this conversation right now about pizza
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:24.100]   And we're in google glass and it pops up a thing that says the nearest shop to you is do blocks away
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:29.300]   Because it's just heard us talking. That's what eric schmitt. That's the remember that pants story that you know
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.380]   You need pants
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:35.140]   And it will just say hey, there's a pants shop right there
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:38.660]   If there even be such a thing as a pants shop
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:42.980]   Or like I'm you know, I look in the refrigerator and I say hey glass
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:48.660]   I need milk. That's what we need. I wish the hell the refrigerators would start ordering food for us
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:52.740]   Yeah, seriously, but then later on when you're walking down the street glass will say hey, there's milk in this store
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:58.900]   Oh, there's a coupon for milk down the street. Okay. So glass is paying attention when you look in your fridge
[01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:03.620]   Is recording everything you eat if it's hummus it sends it to the national security administration, but otherwise
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:07.860]   If you're out of milk and it knows that in the past
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:13.940]   We've seen milk here. We know exactly what brand and the next time i'm walking by pedaluma market says milk
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:15.460]   Here's a coupon
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:21.940]   Yeah, hey, you need milk you so you think that the violation of privacy involved in recording everything that's in your refrigerator add
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.260]   Infinite em is worth that no no no
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:29.140]   I'm saying that I open up our refrigerator and I say okay glass. I need milk and glass just remember
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:35.620]   So you can do that your iPhone right now. Yeah, I can but but you know I am making my cereal here leo come on
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:41.140]   You seriously you can say siri remind me when I get to the market to get milk and it will actually next time you go to the market
[01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:46.980]   It'll say oh you need milk right it's okay. Yeah, so in that case in the case in the use case
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:51.460]   You just put out you don't necessarily need the view you need the mic
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:57.860]   Yeah, but that you have a constant audio feed. So it's star trek computer. Oh
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:00.340]   Yeah computer
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:07.700]   Remind me to get milk right or like oh, I really need to call them. Isn't that better really in the computer trying to figure out if you need milk
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:11.300]   No
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:19.780]   Sorganized i'm getting old i'm forgetting things looking at you jeff i think you need a gin and tonic
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:23.620]   Google you're so right
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:32.420]   Vikugnotra says nexus will have in the next nexus will have insanely great cameras
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:38.740]   I don't this is because of photographer. Yeah, I didn't realize he was such a photography buff. Oh, yeah
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:41.140]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, on all about android last night as well
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:45.700]   I was i'm happy to hear him saying this because I want as the one thing I missed from the iphone
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:48.820]   Did you guys talk about the htc one?
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:53.780]   Yep, because htc announced this new and by the way, it looks like i i'm
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:58.980]   That looks like a beautiful phone. It does and they did something interesting they have it's a
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.460]   effective it's an eight megapixel camera that they
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:05.300]   Sample down to four megapixels and effective four megapixel camera
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:11.220]   And they said and I think this is a very good point the the megapixel race is the wrong direction to go because
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:16.260]   You're not getting bigger sensors. You're just getting smaller pixels on the same size sensor
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:23.620]   So I think that's intriguing and I wonder if that's where vix going or is he thinking like nokia
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:26.100]   Hey, let's put a 41 megapixel camera in there
[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:29.540]   The sensor size is the problem on these things
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:32.900]   They're tiny
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:38.660]   Is it yes, it's not the software the delay. It's also software
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:43.780]   Okay, um, it's also software in fact that was uh, we had an interesting conversation
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:45.940]   with um
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:49.140]   Uh, fellow from nokia, uh, john peter yon peter broadmo
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:55.140]   Who is a photographer but also works at nokia in um in um kind of an entrepreneurial way
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:58.100]   And he says the future photography is computational
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:05.140]   Uh, and I would agree with that and if you think about what you've got with us with a smartphone is you've got a great computer
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:06.900]   very powerful computer
[01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:10.980]   And better and better software and just look at all the filters and things people are doing in software
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:15.940]   Uh, with their camera apps, but you still have to have i'm garbage in garbage. I you still have to have a good sensor
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:18.100]   I would love to see a better sensor. Yeah
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:24.100]   But I don't know that doesn't not it probably does not mean more megapixels. It probably means
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:24.900]   uh
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:32.660]   Bigger so the next phones supposedly the new nexus and the the next super uh, motorola are going to be announced at um, io
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:35.220]   Oh good. Do we have a day for io?
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:38.740]   Last year I got screwed for io because my appendix first
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:45.380]   Goddamn it this year I got asked to key note at the tell me if this is worth it or not at the www conference
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:47.940]   the world wide web conference in brazil
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.380]   Ooh
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:53.780]   I think any chance to go to brazil is a good thing. Yeah, it's a make-a-teeth
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:58.420]   That's when I always yes, and that's when the dub dub dub conferences. Yep
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:00.740]   Hmm
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:06.340]   I think you should go to the conference and gina and i will go to google io and if anything happens we'll get you a paperweight
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:10.340]   15 on drop
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.340]   paperweight
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:16.020]   I think you should go don't you gina? I just think you should go go to witch
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.980]   The web conference. Oh, okay. Yeah
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:26.740]   I'm i'm gonna do absolutely everything I can to get to io so we'll have even coverage that way. Yeah, we're covered
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:34.580]   Uh quickly we got to run uh, let's see anything else that we left out real quick
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:38.500]   Uh leo last week. I mentioned the being the typewriter at the bottom of the google section
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.380]   There's a picture there you might want to show that we're hoping the video folks
[01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:45.220]   The thing the 2.0
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:47.460]   typewriter
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.460]   All right, there it is
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.780]   It's actually a typewriter named bing
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:55.460]   And it says interestingly enough number two
[01:29:55.460 --> 01:30:02.900]   Which is a big is the current bing is of course version three because that's what microsoft does. Oh somebody's joking there
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:05.620]   We're number two
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:09.140]   We try harder
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:12.980]   Um, we could mention the the light light zung
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:14.820]   Schutzrecht
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:20.260]   I stung Schutzrecht google is doing an ad campaign against it on the back of uh cab seats
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:27.780]   Why is it back at cab seats is that because because a a well-known German blogger said that for publishers to charge
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:34.900]   Google for snippets is like a restaurant owner charging a taxi cab driver. Oh, breathe a customer to the door love it
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:38.340]   And the reggae begins nice
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:50.820]   Don't do one of the vvst. I beg you
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:55.460]   Oh, you know, that's gonna happen. Oh, I want to see that remix so bad
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:31:25.060]   I would like to mention that you're a mill nerd marx
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:28.100]   Marissa's been busy it scrolls forever
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:32.180]   That's is the innovation. It's busy
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:36.660]   If I go to yahoo.com will I see it? Is that where it is? Yes, I think so
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:43.220]   It's busy. Yeah, this surprised me. I was expecting when I saw this headline. I was expecting to see the clean white empty
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:47.460]   You know, I was I was trying to expect me to see kind of the google because she's all about minimalism
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.700]   It looks nice
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.500]   It's a different business model. It does infinite scrolling
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.180]   And uh-huh
[01:31:56.180 --> 01:32:00.900]   And like per column scrolling which is nice. Oh, yeah, so I could be in this column and it would scroll forever
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:07.940]   Yeah, like the middle column scrolls for a milli column scrolls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah at some point that the right column fixes itself. Wow
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:12.900]   Uh, it's almost as if tumblr hadn't and men vented that five years ago
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:16.500]   Uh, what else?
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:23.300]   Wow. I know I'm in a bad mood. Yeah, cranky today. I kind of like cranky lino sometimes
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:25.460]   Frankly lio
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:31.220]   Uh, we're gonna take a break when we come back. It will be tip tool and number of the week
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:40.500]   Did we take your no no we didn't we didn't take your tips. So we did we were careful. I protected jina. Yes, jeff jeff block for me
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.660]   Thank you
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:47.780]   I would have just gone and started frantically find another tip before we got there. No wouldn't have you do that
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:50.580]   I want you to all go to uh, get your hover
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:57.300]   Account here if you right now if you go to I got a written right down here hover.com/twig
[01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:01.700]   Uh, this is a better way to get a phone. I'm gonna tell you
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:07.140]   And they have a very good selection of phones including of course all the top and right phones
[01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:12.260]   Hover.com/tricks. So what is hover? Well, they're technically they're an mv no
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:18.500]   A mobile virtual network operator, but really what they are is a no bs cell phone company
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:25.540]   Now they're their cell phone service is they're reselling sprint. So if sprint works well where you are good coverage and so forth
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:28.820]   This is going to be a great choice for you. Um,
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:33.460]   There is no heavy-handed upselling or aggressive women. I'm doing ting
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:37.940]   I should do hover. I wonder I got confused
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:40.340]   Same company. You know why it's the same company's two cows
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:45.860]   So two cows is doing with ting the same thing they're doing with hover. That is we saw a better way to do
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.580]   Something that's being done poorly ting was
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:52.660]   To replace cell phone service hovers to replace domain management and boy
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:58.420]   This is a big improvement. I'm sorry. I got confused, but it's the same company. So it's all the same get ting to
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:01.300]   hover.com/twig
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:06.180]   Is the place to go for getting your domain names managed?
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:08.740]   And uh, I'll tell you there is no upselling
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:16.260]   You get uh, you get who is privacy as part of the deal. They've got a great concierge transfer service
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:21.620]   Um, so that if you have exit and you probably do have names at another site, but you want to move it over
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.620]   They'll do it all for you
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:29.140]   Uh domain start from $15 a year including unlimited domain forwarding no charge who is
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:31.700]   And for that you get a whole new year
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:38.420]   Uh of uh of your domain name. I think you're gonna like it. I want you to go to hover.com/twig right now
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:41.060]   And check it out
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:43.460]   23 top level domains.com, of course
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:48.980]   Although a lot of times you can't get that.com address so they've got dot net as well. Uh very good address
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:53.540]   Uh dot org dot tv.pro.moby.biz
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:58.820]   country tlds too like dot ca.asia.us.uk
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:02.660]   And what I really love is their support. You're not going to have any trouble, but if you did
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:07.380]   You can call their uh toll free number during business hours. You will not be put on hold
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:12.020]   You'll speak to a live person who is fully empowered to make a difference and eager to help
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:15.300]   Two cows is really great. This is uh, this is
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:20.660]   One of my favorite companies, Elliot nasa ceo there really says look there's stuff that's being done so poorly
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:26.500]   We see it as an opportunity. I mentioned the phone service and hover.com domain registry made simple
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:32.420]   If you've got a domain name or you want to register a new one hover.com/twig
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:35.700]   And I think you'd get 10 off your new domain name
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:38.180]   If you do that
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:40.180]   All right now it's time
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:42.340]   For your tip of the week china
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:47.460]   Well, we talked a whole lot about about glass leo not so convinced it's going to be so great
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:49.460]   But we're all kind of curious
[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:52.100]   Yeah, we all we're all curious. We all want to try it
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:56.820]   Uh, so if you weren't at google.io this year and you weren't willing to get in line for that 1500 dollar
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:36:01.220]   Uh explorer edition google's opening up. They they want more testers
[01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:05.140]   So if you go to uh, it's google.com slash glass
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:07.780]   Slash start slash how to get one
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:11.540]   Uh, they're posing a question. What would you do if you had glass?
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:17.540]   And if you answer on twitter or google plus and you use the hashtag if I had glass
[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:20.980]   You just say what what exactly you want to do with glass?
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:24.820]   Uh google's going to that that's so that'll be your official app application to
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:27.780]   So you're in it's not a drawing or anything. That's all you have to do
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:31.940]   Well, no, they act it's an application. So they do have to have to prove you
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:37.780]   Uh, and of course if you search for the search the the hashtag if you had glass on twitter right now and on google plus
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:42.980]   There's some snarky ones about your brain being you know, fried or whatever
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:48.820]   But there's also some really good ones and in fact mr. Jeff Jarvis posted one a really good one
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:52.660]   Jeff, do you want to do you want to read your if I had glass post?
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:57.460]   Only allowed to be uh 50 words and so i'm calling it up right now
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:02.180]   And I said if I had glass I would change journalism forever with my students at qnead
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:09.140]   We'd rethink the news how it is witnessed and shared we'd rethink how news alerts and other information are fed to glass wearers other than leo le port
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:15.700]   We rethink the ui of creating content post-keyboard. We build new business models around class
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:22.260]   And so I did uh that I was very happy you know with that and then then janet and zunner from google said okay
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:26.260]   This is by far the best if I had glass i've seen so far which would be very happy
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:29.860]   Ah, well, I guess you're in you're in I don't know I don't know
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:35.620]   I then tried to play on his heartstrings by saying that I couldn't get it last year because of my first appendix
[01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:42.260]   A zephyr pathetic that's that's yeah, always play the gimp card. I never fail. That's what I do
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:44.660]   I have many maybe of those cards to play leo
[01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:48.740]   I have a whole full house of gimp cards
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:54.660]   It's worth by the way doing the search. You know, you're right mike finch said if you had glass, I'd never use a public restroom ever again
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:57.620]   *laughter*
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:04.340]   Erwin says if you had glass, I'd walk up to you say okay glass razzle dazzle and borrow your keys while you're enhanced and transp other pretty lights
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:08.100]   Great grant says if you had glass I'd hack your face
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:16.740]   Okay, so lots of snark going on there if I had glass, I'd bless the internet with lots of really awesome videos of my daughter giggling so
[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:19.940]   Better than cats
[01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:25.220]   I'd say Jeff's is really good and Jeff if that doesn't earn you a pair. I don't know what's gonna win
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:33.140]   Brian man, I'm trying there's be the privilege to buy a pair. Let's be quickly quick to add give us a number mr
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.980]   J well, I was just going and I there was this fascinating large
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:45.780]   Infographics infographics and data. It is of course are all the rage about a deep dive into a porn star data about
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:50.900]   1000 porn stars, but I looked at it more. I decided now and not for this show so I won't do that
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:52.900]   um
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:57.380]   But it's it's kind of interesting that you can get deep data from anything, but I'll just put it this way
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:01.620]   How fewer that you think are blonde there are I'll just give it a that
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:04.900]   They're all on the west coast
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:08.820]   Most of the west coast. I'll do something boring instead, but it'll be safer
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:15.860]   Uh, google's political spending is up 90 last year and election year to 18.2 million dollars still nothing
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:19.220]   I know facebook's but but compared to facebook was up
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:24.180]   Uh 200 to 4 million and apples was down 13 percent to 2 million
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:28.740]   I guess congressman isn't as expensive as I thought. Yeah
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:32.980]   So you don't really need all that money. No, all right
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:39.220]   My uh my tool I actually have one and this i'm stealing this was it rene rich you showed this this on mac break
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:45.700]   weekly or andi and nacho uh yesterday it's called andi my script calculator and I found out it's also available in android
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:49.860]   And it would really work well on a note, but it could work with any android phone
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:54.180]   Uh, it's free and what it does is you write your calculations
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:40:01.300]   So I could say what is the cosign of pie for instance?
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:07.620]   And it would figure that out. Oops. I oh I have to start over because I had some other stuff on there. Let's say you uh had a
[01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:14.500]   A restaurant bill of $41.22 and you wanted to give a 15% tip
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:21.380]   My percent's not very good $6 in the how do you like that? Wow, that's kind of cool, right?
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:23.940]   Let's start over
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:28.180]   Yeah, you guys aren't uh you're not impressed. No, I'm just getting video lag so I didn't see
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:31.860]   Oh, okay. So it does trigonometry. I could do it in rads or degrees
[01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:35.780]   Um just a kind of cool free app my script calculator
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:41.140]   Let's you draw you know, and you don't need a stylus. You can just do it with your your finger as well three times
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:44.260]   1,264
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:47.460]   And then it figures out the number and does the calculations for you
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:50.180]   And you can email that to somebody
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:56.900]   Also does a lot of uh stuff that's way beyond me with like algebra it'll solve simple variables and so forth
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:59.620]   Radians not rads. Yeah
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:02.420]   Rad's is the units of nuclear radiation
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:09.780]   Gina trapehne is at smarter where dot org and everybody should go there and read her website
[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:13.060]   She also is the author of think up app and the mother of edda
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:15.220]   And the host
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:20.820]   Coast of all about android. I didn't have my arena to pick for next week. I don't know. I just downloaded my script calculus
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:22.820]   It's really fun
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:24.820]   You can't stop playing with it
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:32.580]   Oh my god, sony's already announced something so we're gonna rush Jeff Jarvis buzz machine dot com. See you later. Thanks for joining us
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:35.700]   We'll see you next week on this week in google
[01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:37.700]   You
[01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:39.700]   You

[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:45.700]   [acoustic guitar chords]
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:48.360]   (light music)
