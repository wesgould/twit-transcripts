[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, Jeff and Stacey are here.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.040]   We've got lots to talk about.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.080]   Jeff has been following the Senate and congressional hearings from Facebook and Google and Twitter.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.880]   He'll have his take on that.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.960]   Plus, why all those ideas from the New York Times on improving Facebook are terrible.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.840]   Stacey's going to talk about, of course, the Internet of Things and her new Amazon Echo.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.600]   Plus, we'll debate the merits of queso.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.760]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.920]   It's time for Twig this week at Google's show.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.120]   We cover the Senate hearings going on right now because it's Google, Facebook and Twitter.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.040]   We cover the state of journalism because we have two premier journalists on the show.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.680]   It is always a fun show welcoming back Jeff Jarvis from his trip, his travels.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.320]   Remember, I was like, I can't even remember dressed up for us.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.320]   Look at this.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   What a nice.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.320]   I can dress up.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   See, I can, I can look.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.320]   You were on TV earlier today.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   Well, I was supposed to be on a messy, he talking about the hearings.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.440]   But now they're not talking about anything, of course, but.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440]   Exactly as I'm driving in, no surprise.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.040]   I get the message at six o'clock in the morning.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.800]   Oh, no, we are preempted by the carer attack in New York, which understandable fully.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   Of course.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   That's not a course.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.640]   They don't send a car for you.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.880]   I live way the hell out that I can't get back home.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.840]   So those in the car to get you, but not to send to bring you.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.240]   Well, they send cars for me and then they take me home.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.240]   It's very exciting.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.000]   Well, but I've got a work for you today.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I've been work all day.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.920]   Oh, and then he has no way to get home.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.920]   I get it.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.120]   They would take you back to a CUNY.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.480]   I suspect they would give me a car to go home, but it's kind of, it's too much to send
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480]   to embarrassing.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.480]   That is embarrassing.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.480]   I agree.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.080]   Anyway, good to have you back.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.960]   We missed you, although I have to say having Stacey in studio was so exciting and such a
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.480]   thrill was really great to meet you.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.440]   Stacey Aegenbotham, formerly of Gigah Ome for many years.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.440]   She's now doing her own thing and it's a great thing.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.640]   Stacey on IOT.com.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.760]   She also has a podcast with Kevin Tofel about the Internet of Things at Gigah Stacey.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   Hello, Stacey.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.320]   Back in your home so you can root for your Astros, which is good.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   It is.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.320]   I'm very excited.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.360]   Game seven tonight of what has been one of the most exciting World Series I can remember.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.520]   It's really been good.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.240]   I'm very excited about it.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.760]   I'm not even that into sports.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.160]   But I've been watching this in Stranger Things on and off last week.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.120]   Our local team, the San Francisco Giants, have been so bad this year, so horrifically
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.920]   bad this year that they were out of contention even before the all-star break.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.760]   So I kind of didn't pay attention to baseball, but now I'm excited.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.320]   Both the Astros and the Dodgers are 100 game winners.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.160]   These are very, very good teams and it is a very, very good World Series.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.640]   But that's all the sport ball talk for today.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.920]   When Stacey came here, by the way, Jeff, we did something so bad I wasn't there.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.680]   We ordered Chipotle for everybody and we, of course, got a tub of queso.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.840]   Because Stacey had never had it.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.560]   You complain how grainy it is.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.080]   It is friggin awful.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.880]   You are not alone, by the way.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.880]   Everybody hates Chipotle queso.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   Oh, it is dreadful.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.880]   I didn't tell me.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   She's just Boston, Texas.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.880]   She's Boston, Texas.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.880]   You're not saying anything about this crap.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.080]   It was not grainy.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.160]   I didn't taste the graininess, which thank God.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.080]   That may be how it's prepared too, right?
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080]   Because that sounds like...
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.200]   No, they take it out of the thing and they pour it down.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.040]   No, it's not.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.040]   They make it.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   It's awful.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.320]   I put up a picture on the rundown of what queso ought to be.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   Like this.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.320]   No, not that junk.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.320]   I just tell.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.520]   It's just, it's wallpaper paste.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.600]   It's grainy.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   It's so soupy.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.600]   It's milky.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   It's thin.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.200]   I thought it was pretty good, actually.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.320]   Oh, God, it's awful.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.320]   Stacey, what is this?
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.120]   I didn't think it was that bad.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.720]   It's not high quality queso.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:24.360]   But I will say, I've gone to Taco Cabanet too in the morning and gotten queso that is
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.760]   only slightly better than that.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.000]   And I would still pay for that.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.360]   Now I'm wondering about Jeff, because this image of queso you're giving us from Mose.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.400]   Wait, that's your queso, Jell?
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   That was so moderate.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   Compared compared.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   Yes.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   No, that's velveeta.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   Jeff, this is not queso.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   That is even velveeta.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   There's no quandary.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   There's no quandary.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   No, no, Jeff.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   What do you know about that?
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.320]   Jeff needs to be edge-egett-micated.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.880]   After, after tweeting, after tweeting this, and you're tweeting this, that's what I got
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.480]   in the mail.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.720]   It says queso is life.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.360]   That's true.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.360]   If I...
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.360]   I seriously thought about creating this.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.440]   You can see queso/mole tumbler.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.160]   And no one sends me t-shirts about queso in the mail.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   This is very distressing.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.840]   You would deserve it if you had any real taste on queso.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.000]   If you could even tolerate that drivel, that drivel.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Wait a minute, the boxing club has to go across.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.200]   If you do anything less, then go running out in the street screaming about what they
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.200]   did to queso.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.920]   They ruined queso.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.480]   Again, not the best queso, but definitely not the worst.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.520]   And better than whatever that was, you tweeted.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.680]   That did not look good at all.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.520]   I would have to taste this mose queso to see because just a picture.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.720]   And we're going to have a queso.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   Sounds good.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   A queso.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   A queso.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.160]   The other thing we have to try, which I still have the jar in the pantry, which we talked
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.600]   about once before, is the Trader Joe's fat-free queso.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   Oh, Jeff.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.920]   Queso doesn't come into jar.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.640]   See, I'm just really glad that for some reason, queso doesn't come in the whole way either.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.520]   You can't get queso in Northern California.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.760]   Chipotle is the first, I didn't even know about queso till I went to Austin, Texas.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.480]   And by the way, my reaction was, oh my God, where have you been all my life?
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.480]   I mean, no.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.320]   Queso is good, but I'm glad they don't have queso here because I would be even fatter
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.320]   than I already am.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.320]   But it's ruined.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.920]   Well, okay, well, you're not going to get fat on Chipotle queso.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.120]   That's for sure, because it's awful.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.440]   It's terrible.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.440]   I liked it.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.440]   I thought it was delicious.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:42.120]   And by the way, all the nice things we ever did for Chipotle, they ever send us a nice
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.280]   Chipotle t-shirt?
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.280]   Actually, no.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:51.080]   But we did have the digital marketing guy from Chipotle came to visit the studio and
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.640]   he gave us like a bunch of coupons.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.960]   So oh, yeah, we've got free Chipotle for a while.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.760]   I don't know if the one we had with Stacy here last week was free, but I'm writing down.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.240]   And who started the whole Chipotle thing on the show?
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.240]   You and Gina.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.440]   Stacy, no.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.280]   All right, I admired you.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.520]   I trusted you.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.840]   I respected you.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.960]   Now he's had credibility.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.440]   Everything you say is in question.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.440]   Oh, Ron.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:28.160]   How could you not have just dumped that Stacy on the curb?
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.160]   It wasn't mine to dump.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.800]   First of all, I like it.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.160]   The chips were bad, though.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.160]   The chips were bad.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.800]   Well, they weren't good, but they weren't like they weren't warm fresh out of the oven
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   or anything.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.920]   No, they were stale and they were too thin.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.480]   You need you need a more substantial chip with a little bit more like that's actually
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.040]   the biggest objection I had on that by the case.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.360]   So it's the chip diverting.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.880]   You're diverting.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.880]   I am.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.880]   Well, I'm not just diverting.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.400]   I mean, but here in California, we prefer guacamole to case.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.800]   So if you're going to put something on a chip, wait, oh, it's OK.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.840]   My freshman 15 in Austin, you can buy a bowl of queso with a giant scoop of guacamole in
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   it.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.840]   Oh, God.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.840]   Oh, my God.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   It's so good.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   Right back to the cardiologist.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   Oh, my God.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.600]   I used every every not probably three nights a week.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.480]   We would go in and get that plus it was two for one short stacks of pancakes.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.720]   Oh, no wonder.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   That's 15.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.720]   For me, it was fantastic.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.040]   But I was like, what is happening with my body?
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.520]   Why am I gaining so much weight?
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.120]   And then I was like, oh, now Jeff, Jeff did.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:43.480]   We have to say pick the best pizza in the United States officially for was it people
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.000]   magazine or Google magazine?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.360]   For Google magazine.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.320]   So this is not an amateur here.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.880]   I have a professional experience at this.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   I off.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.280]   I really think we might have to do a case off.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.440]   I think we have to do a case off.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.880]   It got us a show title of nothing else.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.880]   Yeah, I wrote it down.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.520]   So Austin for South by will start it.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.760]   Oh, we were beyond that now.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.840]   I love the barbecue in Austin that actually I never have the text max.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   Well, no, we do.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.840]   We always go when we go.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.560]   There's a place.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.560]   There's that place.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.720]   We had Brazilian in Austin.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.840]   Yeah, that was a mistake, but that's that's OK.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.800]   That was that was the dinner of all the people who would come down for us and.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.200]   Plus you were fortunate.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.960]   It did cost quite a bit.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.720]   Was it the trasky at the meat on towards place?
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   Yeah, sure.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.040]   How do you say that?
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.040]   Not sure.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.520]   I'm not sure.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   Sure.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.520]   No, sure.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.160]   Yeah, it's the Polish meat on the whole.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.160]   The whole the kill boss.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.160]   So you can eat.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.520]   I don't know.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   But it turns out it's a chain and we even have one in San Francisco.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.520]   Fogo to Chow.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.720]   It's right across the street.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.120]   Yeah, I'm going to say I'll send you the cup.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.120]   So is life.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.200]   OK, so it's OK.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.800]   Fill it with that junk.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.520]   You know what?
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.960]   I have all the case.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.760]   So I need like not even five minutes for me.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.120]   It's so good.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.440]   Also, which stop from it.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.800]   But I see I was jealous, but now I don't know.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.320]   It's easy.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.120]   No, I don't know.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.240]   I don't know.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.200]   I will bring you to great case of places.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.120]   All right.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.680]   All right.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.600]   All right.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.840]   This is this is going to this is I think a world case.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.520]   So tour.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.200]   Do they even have queso in Mexico?
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.760]   No, it's an American thing.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.880]   I'm sure it's Tex-Mex.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.800]   It's probably a Tex-Mex thing because we're Tex-Mexes yellow
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.240]   cheese beans and beef.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.040]   OK.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.520]   Whoa.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.160]   Facebook just announced third quarter profit jump 79%.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.720]   This has been a very, very good quarter for the tech companies.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.320]   Google's results.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.640]   Superb Microsoft results.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.960]   We were talking about it earlier on Windows Weekly.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:55.080]   The best quarterly net revenues in more than a decade.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.680]   Apple will have its quarterly results soon.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.480]   I'm sure they'll be.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.120]   And again, it's been a really, really good tech sector
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.520]   quarter.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.280]   And really, I think we can call it the Trump bump
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.160]   because all across the board stocks are up.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.520]   Consumer confidence is up.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.840]   Employment is up.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.360]   He's a damn fine president.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:17.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.760]   It's Jeff's head spinning around.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.640]   I was trying the case of the case of stuff to even work.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.760]   That's how bad it is.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.400]   Even worse.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.560]   Before the show we were watching and I'm still watching,
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.160]   the Razer phone announcement.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.320]   This is an interesting development.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.480]   Razer, which is known for gaming accessories and gaming
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.240]   laptops, R-A-Z-E-R. This is not the Motorola Razer.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.920]   This is a new phone from the gaming company.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.240]   Acquired, you may remember NextBit.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.720]   They made, they were a crowd sourced phone, which I got
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.920]   and I liked.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.320]   The NextBit Robin.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.560]   And they acquired that team, which included some people who
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.840]   had worked for Google on Android.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.040]   And they developed in-house an Android TV device called the Uya.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.440]   Both those teams work together to make a $699 phone,
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.920]   which they're announcing today, which is primarily for gaming.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.080]   But we'll also have, I don't know why the quality is so poor
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:14.600]   on this.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.360]   Maybe I've said something wrong on--
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.600]   let me look at the settings.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.880]   Quality is auto right now.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.160]   Let me turn it up.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.840]   This is their keynote in London, which is going on right now.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.320]   That is a great accent.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.920]   I'm not sure who he is.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.400]   I presume he's the CEO of Razer.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.560]   They say will be available November--
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   no, reservations are available today.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.280]   And it'll be shipping November 17.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.640]   So this is really interesting.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.120]   The competition has heated up, not just in Android,
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.240]   but with people who have iPhone 8s
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.440]   are now looking at the iPhone 10s, which
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.760]   start coming on Friday.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.640]   And actually, I want to talk a little bit about how Apple's
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.840]   very interesting Apple marketing strategy
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.200]   and the way they, I think, I say, although others disagree,
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.720]   Andy and I got in a fight over at yesterday on MacBrick Weekly,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.000]   manipulated the media that Apple press in an interesting way.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.440]   But-- and then Google's two new phones, the Pixel 2
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.920]   and the Pixel 2 XL are out.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.640]   But now this phone, out of nowhere, stock Android,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.640]   it's going to have a giant 4,000 milliamp hour battery,
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.000]   which does respond, I think, to the people who
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.160]   have been hating, frankly, on modern phones
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.000]   because of poor battery life.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.240]   A special screen that gives you 120 Hertz resolution.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.960]   It's a gaming-- focus on gaming phone.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.520]   And interestingly, they'll use the Nova launcher
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.320]   as their launcher, which, I think, really, in a way,
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.320]   is a very good idea.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.880]   It's the launcher that many Android aficionados choose
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.440]   to use instead of pixels, the Google Pixel launcher
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.520]   and others.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.800]   So--
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   What's the main thing that makes it a gaming phone?
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.440]   The 120 Hertz refresh rate.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.400]   Apple does something similar on iPads.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.360]   They can get up to 200 Hertz, I think, on iPads.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.880]   But it's only when it senses that it's--
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.920]   needs it or something.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.160]   I don't know exactly how it works.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.640]   It doesn't normally sit there.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.280]   It normally sits at the normal 60 Hertz.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.280]   So this is twice as fast for fresh rate.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.640]   They're really pushing that.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.560]   They bought THX.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:25.400]   So it's going to have THX sound, front-facing dual speakers.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.960]   They call it the ultimate entertainment phone.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:34.000]   And it's unlocked 699, which makes it very competitive.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I think with some of the other--
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.920]   Unibody aluminum phone with the Razer logo on the back dual
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.280]   cameras.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.720]   I don't know whose software they're
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.600]   going to use for the cameras.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.200]   A Snapdragon 835.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.000]   It has eight gigs of RAM, which is, again, way over spec.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.560]   MicroSD slot, no headphone jack, type C charger.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.600]   And there is a dongle that's THX certified in the box
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.640]   for 24-bit sound, high-res audio.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.240]   Which actually is probably a good idea.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.600]   I don't know.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:09.960]   I don't know.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.520]   An analog jack on the phone isn't maybe the best way to do that.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.040]   So this--
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.600]   This is a log jack?
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.320]   What's that?
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.000]   Yeah, what is that?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.600]   Nobody's doing that anymore.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.160]   7-1-1, although they say Oreo before the end of the year.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:30.440]   Well, 12 and a 13 megapixel cameras on the back one wide
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.400]   angle, one zoom, and eight megapixel on the front.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.280]   Why wouldn't they put a headphone jack on this?
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.840]   Because honestly, Bluetooth sound qualities--
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:38.840]   I know.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.280]   --they're proving to codecs.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:40.720]   But--
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.720]   I know.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.360]   I said--
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.720]   They're pushing the sound.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.520]   I agree, although you can hardwire headphones
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.920]   into it through their dongle.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.560]   Yeah, but--
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.200]   Why don't you just take $50 for me now, just as a tax?
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.560]   Roll the dongles up high.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.120]   The dongles-- I feel like such an idiot walking around
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.720]   with my phone with the dongles still hanging on it.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.920]   It's like--
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.920]   Well, keep the dongle on the headphones.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.720]   That would be tip number one.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.680]   Like, when I travel, I swap between my normal headsets
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.760]   and the noise canceling headsets.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.640]   And so is it ideal?
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.840]   No.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.720]   And also, I grabbed the wrong dongle
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.880]   before I went up to Studio.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.080]   And then I was just so frustrated.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.880]   And you can't charge unless you buy the really expensive one?
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.640]   Yeah, I was feeling very--
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.160]   No.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.320]   --I was like, tech is failing me right now.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.160]   I agree with Niele Patel, who said it's user hostile.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.480]   He's talking about Apple doing it.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:43.960]   But--
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.000]   That's a good phrase, yeah.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.800]   It's user hostile.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.960]   And unfortunately, Apple and Google are doing it.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.360]   And now so is Razer.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.760]   I mean, this has become the--
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.760]   Does he essentially--
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.520]   No, no headphone jack on the essential either.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.720]   Everyone's doing it.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.080]   You wanted to buy a pair of headphones with a USB-C?
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.160]   Dittles don't exist, right?
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.640]   They do.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.000]   But I mean, yeah, good luck finding them.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.920]   Well, kind of quality.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.720]   One phone, I think it was the essential shipped
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.880]   with USB-C headphones.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.880]   But it mustn't be a standard because I tried them
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.960]   on other devices with USB-C ports.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.280]   And there's no audio coming out of it.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.080]   Really?
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.680]   Well, I don't know.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.720]   I don't know what that means.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.240]   But--
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.480]   Yes.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.360]   So there you go.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.120]   That's kind of the breaking news today.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.360]   And then the Senate is having hearings.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.000]   The House just ended theirs.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.600]   The House ended theirs in the Senate now
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.800]   or that was just the House?
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.440]   No, it was the House.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.480]   Yes, it was yesterday House today.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.120]   I've watched both of them.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.400]   So I do want to talk about that because I think those
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.240]   are interesting.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.440]   Yesterday was the General Counsel for Facebook, Twitter,
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.920]   and Google who faced the Senate and really didn't say much.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.360]   But you probably watched.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.200]   I was busy working, so I didn't get to watch it.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.920]   There you were.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.640]   What did they say?
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.760]   What happened?
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.400]   Oh, I mean, not much happened.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.840]   It's just-- my overall impression
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.600]   is for God to help us if these people, the government people,
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.840]   end up running the internet.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.480]   They're just ignorant.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.520]   It's just-- everybody's all talked about pipes and tubes.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.000]   And a lot of hostility from both left and right to the platforms.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.560]   It's very easy target right now.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.120]   It really struck me how the platform should have come out
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.760]   a bit way ahead of this.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.760]   And this is Silicon Valley, hubris, really hurts them.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.240]   They should have been way ahead of us and set new standards.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.800]   So it was the Senate Committee, right?
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.440]   Which was it the Intelligence Committee?
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.640]   Intelligence Committee.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.320]   There was some committee to set it.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.640]   And I think it was the--
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.120]   I think it's the House Intelligence Committee.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.200]   Oh, the House Intelligence Committee.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.240]   And the idea is that they want to know, well,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.880]   did you help Russia meddle in US politics, essentially, right?
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.240]   So I'll break it.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.600]   Go ahead.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.040]   So I've been covering these things for a decade now.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.360]   So I have watched many a tech getting raked over the polls
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.400]   by Congress, members of Congress, and these hearings.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.760]   These are not--
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.480]   these are-- what's the word for theater?
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.720]   Yes, they're political theater.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.080]   Grandstanding might be the word.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.600]   They're grandstanding.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   So the thing to know about this is this is basically
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.880]   Congress getting to say they're talking points
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.080]   and yelling at these companies.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.440]   This is not going to result in anything substantive.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.760]   What happens substantively happens
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.920]   behind closed doors with the lobbyists for these companies
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.240]   and the aides for the senators and representatives.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.480]   So I would caution folks from reading too much into this.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.160]   Let me give you a couple of quotes from yesterday's hearings.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.800]   This is Senator Mark Warner of Virginia.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   I hear all your words, but I have more than a little bit
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.320]   of frustration that many of us on this committee
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.840]   have been raising this issue, the issue of Russian
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.480]   influencing the election.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.600]   Since the beginning of this year, and our claims
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.600]   are frankly blown off by the leadership of your companies,
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.960]   and dismissed, that's true.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.040]   Facebook denied it for more than a year.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.120]   We've raised these claims since the beginning of the year,
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.680]   and the leaders of your companies blew us off.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.240]   Your earliest presentations showed a lack of resources,
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.600]   a lack of genuine effort, a lack of commitment.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.160]   Dianne Feinstein said, "I don't think you get it.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.560]   What we're talking about is a cataclysmic change.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.080]   What we're talking about is the beginning of cyber warfare.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.280]   You have a huge problem on your hands."
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.000]   Ron Wyden said, "We'd like to walk out of here
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.120]   knowing the changes you're going to support."
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.400]   Senator Burr, chairman of the committee,
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   suggested Congress should supply the companies
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.840]   with antitrust waivers, because of course,
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.000]   collaboration might be considered a conclusion.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.360]   So they would need to have some sort of indemnification.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.240]   - But they already do share a lot.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.800]   - And said, "Now, admittedly, you're right.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.520]   These are talking points, Senator's grandstanding,
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.040]   but I don't disagree with those points to you."
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.840]   - Yeah, the problem is that it's--
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   - Go ahead, Stacy.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.200]   - No, go ahead, okay.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.320]   - No, no, no, you go, you go.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.840]   - So there's two things here.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.840]   One is it looks like, well, one is Congress
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.040]   has is pushing all the blame under the tech companies,
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.960]   which may or may not be fair,
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.600]   but they're also refusing to look at
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.720]   and analyze what it means that these companies
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.040]   are international in scope,
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.240]   even though they're based here in the US.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.440]   And so if they're saying, okay,
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.680]   you guys need to do better to prevent Russia
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.600]   from hacking our elections or overly
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.960]   unduly influencing things,
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.160]   they're forgetting that Facebook, Google and Twitter
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.800]   may have conflicting goals in Russia.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.840]   So I think they're ignoring the real issues here,
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.040]   which I think we should be talking about, which is--
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.400]   - But Facebook's participation in Russia
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.040]   doesn't mean that they should allow Russians to buy ads
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.840]   in political ads in America.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.840]   I understand that when they're in Russia,
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.120]   they have to follow the laws of Russia and stuff.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.480]   But when the internet research agency,
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.880]   Russia's troll factory spends rubles
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.760]   to buy ads on Facebook influencing the US election,
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:19.760]   which is illegal, how can Facebook say, oh, we didn't know?
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.840]   - Let's talk about that.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.680]   Let's talk about that.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.280]   'Cause I mean, Al Franken, who I generally like,
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.200]   use that for major theater to go after.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.560]   - Rubbles, rubles, rubles.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.880]   Okay, well, there's five million advertisers
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.920]   a month on Facebook.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.520]   I'm not trying to just defend Facebook here.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.600]   Facebook needs to do more,
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.400]   but how could this happen?
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.320]   Well, they can't, as he said, it's such a theater,
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.400]   you can't actually answer this.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.760]   We just have to throw yourself on the ground,
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.200]   prostate and say, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.360]   - But Facebook says we're doubling from 10,000 to 20,000,
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.240]   the number of people who are involved
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.720]   in fairening this out.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.320]   But they also said that this troll factory
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.920]   reached 150 million people, 150 million Americans
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.560]   through Facebook-- - But Facebook's million.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.680]   - Oh, I see-- - No, the new number--
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.480]   - This is the new number.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.040]   - It was 126 million.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.720]   - Okay, let's talk about a few things here.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.560]   - Let's talk about a few things.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.720]   - One.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.040]   The ad was bought in the rubles.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.360]   Well, this is an international company
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.560]   that sells things all around the world.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.680]   If they weren't looking for that signal,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.720]   if they weren't aware that we need to be looking
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.440]   for political ads bought with rubles,
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.560]   they're not gonna find that.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.760]   It's not like, oh, gee, yeah, somebody's there looking
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.640]   at all five million advertisers every minute.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.960]   They had to be aware that this was a problem.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.680]   They weren't, maybe they were stupid.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.520]   - Okay.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.920]   - But that's point one.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.200]   - But wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.360]   - I agree that it's ridiculous to say,
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.080]   well, we're gonna play a blame game at this point.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.720]   What's completely reasonable is for these senators to say,
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.160]   well, what are you gonna do now?
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.400]   And there's one very simple thing,
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.520]   which is to add transparency,
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.080]   and these companies seem to be correct anymore.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.840]   - And they're saying they're doing that.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.760]   Now, I think they've gotta be,
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.800]   my standard for transparency is every political ad,
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.280]   every political ad buyer,
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.840]   and the targeting data for all of them should be public.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.000]   - Yes. - And searchable.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.720]   - Is that what Facebook's doing?
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.560]   That's what I think they said they're doing.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.400]   At first they didn't.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.720]   I think they are now, I don't know.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.800]   I don't have the latest statement on this,
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.840]   but that's my standard for what they need to do.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.760]   Now, mind you, there is no required transparency
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.200]   of political advertising in print,
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.960]   not on billboards, not in direct mail,
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.800]   not in robo-boy.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.480]   - Whoa, you have to-- - There is on broadcast.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.120]   - Oh, okay, so print, you don't have to--
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.480]   - So close who bought? - Of course not.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.480]   Oh, I didn't know that. - Of course not.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.640]   - Oh, that's interesting. - Well, you're not gonna disclose.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.360]   They're paper, they're gonna disclose a thing.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.720]   - They should change that for newspapers too.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.160]   - No, then.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.920]   Well, this is where we're gonna get to the First Amendment,
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.640]   ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.840]   So-- - The First Amendment
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.680]   does not protect foreign governments
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.200]   from interfering in our politics.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.920]   That's illegal and it's not protected
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.760]   by the First Amendment. - But that does not protect it
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.120]   by the First Amendment. - The enforcement, fine.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.760]   And if a foreign government buys a fake ad,
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.640]   is it up to the newspaper to know that?
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.240]   That it went through five shell companies?
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.720]   - No, no, no.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.960]   If somebody buys a fake ad-- - They need to be transparent.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.120]   That's all.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.680]   - Well, but transparent, yeah, I know, I know,
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.120]   and I agree with that, I just said that.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.280]   They should be fully transparent.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.680]   But let's remember, the transparency is also gonna be limited
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.560]   because it goes through shell companies.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.720]   They're trolls.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.280]   - Let the press do their job and be transparent
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.240]   and let the press figure it out.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.160]   - We're agreeing and yelling at each other.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.160]   - Yeah, well-- - But, but, but,
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.160]   but, beware putting a legal requirement in this area.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.800]   I mean, broadcast is there 'cause it's our airwaves
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.640]   and all that.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.000]   The rest is a matter of the First Amendment
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.800]   in terms of what laws, listen,
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.160]   if-- - The good news is newspapers
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.120]   are dying anyway, so we don't really care about print.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.160]   - Second point. - That's the good news.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.360]   - Second point.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.880]   The fact that they got 126 or 150 million people
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.800]   to see, supposedly, this stuff from this one
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.560]   Russian fake news factory, the IRA,
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.280]   the internet research agency.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.840]   What does that indicate?
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.000]   It indicates that a hell of a lot of your neighbors
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.040]   passed this stuff around.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.560]   It indicates that was, that wasn't the advertising.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.040]   That was the organic.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.160]   That was, that was content that people passed around.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.880]   Now, bots had a role too, the ads had a role too,
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.560]   all that had a role.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.400]   But we got a bigger problem here, folks,
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.640]   which is that if your fellow citizens are passing this,
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.600]   crap around.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.800]   Point three. - I don't think that's
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.960]   as much of a problem.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.240]   And by the way, I'm looking at
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.200]   the Federal Election Commission's website.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.760]   And disclaimer notices are required of broadcast,
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.720]   newspaper, magazine, outdoor advertising,
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.600]   mass mailing and telephone banks.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.400]   - Of the political campaign.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.680]   When it is for a candidate, wait, when it's for a candidate.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.600]   Most of this advertising was for issues.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.080]   - A communication that solicit funds
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.920]   for a federal candidate or federal political committee
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.200]   that contains, or that contains express advocacy.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.800]   - Of a political campaign.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.640]   - Yeah.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.480]   - I can go advocate for for legal rights
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.600]   for all human beings.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.440]   - Right.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.280]   - I don't have to.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.120]   - Part of the problem with some of these ads
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.240]   is they don't even mention a candidate.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.240]   - 90% of them.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.080]   - Yeah.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.920]   - Well, 90% of them are,
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.040]   and they're trying to sow discord by going after,
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.040]   after raids.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.040]   The real problem to me is that media
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.520]   need to learn a lesson here.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.480]   Our, you know, we just still say,
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.000]   oh come and read our articles.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.520]   We'll wait for you over here.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.760]   - While the bad guys are using
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.240]   Facebook and company natively.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.080]   - Well, see, that's why--
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.120]   - They don't even mind us
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.240]   how to use them natively.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.560]   - I don't think it really matters so much about print
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.520]   because the real problem is these programmatic ads
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.520]   that are bought and automatically displayed,
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.120]   the kind of granularity that can happen
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.480]   and the fact that they're dark ads.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.600]   You know, if that's in a newspaper, everybody sees it.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.520]   But dark ads are shown only to specific people
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.760]   and no one else sees them.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.600]   So really--
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.960]   - It's an internet problem more than it is.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.640]   - It's also, no, it's direct mail.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.280]   It's been the case of us as direct mail.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.600]   - Yeah, I guess direct mail would be the same, right?
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.920]   - Right.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.760]   - So I'm not taking Facebook off the hook.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.000]   What I'm saying is that Facebook and Twitter and Google
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.360]   should set a standard far beyond that a broadcast.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.880]   They have a public responsibility.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.240]   They should have been ahead of this.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.440]   The only reason they're sitting there is
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.600]   because the hubris of Silicon Valley said,
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.800]   oh we don't have a problem, we don't have a problem.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.880]   I'm talking about a problem.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.920]   They had a problem.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.280]   And they should have been out front saying,
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.920]   this is what we know, this is what we don't know.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.720]   And we're being manipulated.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.280]   They could have been the story,
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.920]   the Russians could have been the story rather than them.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.240]   So they messed up big time.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.720]   I'm not defending them there.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.880]   But, but my bigger point is when you listen to these dorks,
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.760]   ignorant fools in Congress,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.200]   I dread what they did to the internet.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.760]   Trey Gowdy was just on in the house hearing,
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.160]   pushing hard against the platforms, against Facebook.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.720]   Well, if I say it's Thursday and it's not,
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.160]   how should that be allowed?
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.600]   Well, our lies constantly protected.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.680]   And then Facebook lawyers says, yes,
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.280]   the Supreme Court has actually said,
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.160]   yes, because the dolt doesn't get our own constitution.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.080]   If lies are not allowed, then whether it's a court
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.320]   or it's Facebook or it's Trey Gowdy says,
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.000]   this is a lie and you can't say that.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.800]   That's a limitation on speech from a government level.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.880]   And our own member of Congress doesn't understand.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.560]   Yeah, although there's a long history of Congress,
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.800]   not understanding the First Amendment going right back to the.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.720]   Amen. So to me, the base is very beginning.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.600]   The whole story is you don't want these people controlling the internet.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.000]   So Facebook platforms, Google Facebook,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.880]   get your damn dacks together and get ahead of them.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.880]   Otherwise, they're going to be on your asses regulating our net.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:30.760]   What I would like to see, I feel like I should applaud you, Jeff there,
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.360]   but what I would like to see.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:32.840]   I never know.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.560]   It says, you're going to.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.840]   Plot or punch.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.320]   Plot or punch.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.280]   When these as bear.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.240]   Well, no, it's more just like very impassioned, very impassioned.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:44.920]   I would like to see a database that maybe all of these,
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.680]   I mean, the federateds, the outbrains, Facebook, etc.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.840]   feed into with political ads.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.200]   Like a database that says, hey, this ad,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.160]   and gives the context or the article or the whatever.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.480]   Was paid for.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:04.680]   In promoted, put it in a database somewhere or make it,
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.440]   put it somewhere and make it basically accessible via an API.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.080]   So reporters could actually go in and look at trends.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.360]   That's a great idea.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.440]   So to cross all of these platforms.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.680]   The problem does not every ads political, Stacey.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.520]   I mean, that's the way the election are necessarily overtly political.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.360]   So we can see, I mean, we've got to start somewhere.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.680]   I would say the things to look out for and the language that you'd pay
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.120]   attention to if anyone tried to create something like this would be,
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.120]   how do we define what makes it in there?
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:34.440]   Right?
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.200]   Is it paid advertisement?
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.560]   How do we define an issue?
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.800]   But too, how do we make sure that it's open?
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.560]   Because I can see Facebook creating something like this in house.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:49.400]   And I would love for companies not, I mean, you can't find a FOIA request with Facebook.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.440]   So how do you make it really easily accessible?
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:59.160]   And I feel like honestly, our government is falling so far behind when they're
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.120]   thinking about legislation, when we just look at their open records request,
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.280]   when they look at their digitization efforts.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.560]   And I think these are very interrelated in those kind of tools.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.400]   We blame the media a lot.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:16.280]   But what Facebook has done and what Russia and everyone took advantage of is the fact that
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:23.480]   we can scale up falsehoods and micro target them in a way that the media can't even
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.360]   track.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:30.360]   So we can't, the fourth estate as it were, can't do its job because it doesn't have the same ability.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:35.880]   So I would like to see the creation of that and then reporters getting good at using those tools.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.760]   And Congress made it a little easier.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.240]   And academics too.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.720]   And academics are doing some really good things.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.120]   And they work around.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.240]   I mean, they reverse engineer a lot of this stuff actually.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.280]   So I don't want to just see the ads.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.840]   Very importantly, I want to see the targeting data.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.040]   So who's being targeted with what message?
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.400]   Facebook has said, and this is their post from October 27th, a couple of days ago,
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:09.800]   additional transparency for all advertising, not just political ads, all advertising.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.480]   All are starting next month, people will be able to click on view ads on a page
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:19.080]   and view the ads of pages running on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, whether or not the person
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.080]   viewing is the intended target audience.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.320]   That's a good question.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.600]   That's a big step.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.240]   All pages will be part of this effort.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.960]   And we require that all ads be associated with a page.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.000]   So in other words, this covers every ad.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.960]   So there's no ads that are not parts of a page.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.200]   They're going to start this in Canada.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:40.600]   Roll it out.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.120]   This goes beyond broadcast.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.560]   This is a big deal.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:48.120]   If they'd done this before, they were called before Congress,
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.440]   if they'd done this before there was a law proposed, they would have beaten the punch.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.040]   Not that the Congress still wouldn't want to make hay out of beating them up,
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.040]   but they could have been in a much stronger position.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.280]   And by the way, I don't think any legitimate advertiser would have any complaint against this.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.840]   As in this example, Jasper's market and somebody comes to your page and says,
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.480]   I'd like to see all the ads from Jasper's market.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.360]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.360]   Well, Leo, here's the thing.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.320]   If you are a consumer brand,
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.680]   that is brand, let's say advertiser, and you're trying to A/B test.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.680]   Come on.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.560]   This is a promise.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.920]   That's not going to affect your A/B testing.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.800]   That's too small.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.400]   No, who's going to do that?
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.160]   Only people who are competitive.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.440]   I know the argument, the argument, the brands will be the competitors will go,
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.680]   and they'll have sophisticated ways to find out what's going on.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:33.400]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.160]   Well, so what?
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.600]   That improves competition.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.480]   I agree for it.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:37.800]   This is...
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   We need to figure out how to instill trust.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:46.120]   And transparency is the first step to trust, and we've got to be responsible about it.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.720]   Or is there more?
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.840]   Do you guys both agree?
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.920]   Not only a good first step, but this might be all Facebook needs to do,
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.160]   and Twitter and Google should do the same thing.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:59.080]   I would like to make sure that it's accessible to everyone.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.320]   I would like to be able to pull this data in easily.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.240]   Yeah, I like the API idea.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.040]   I agree.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:04.600]   You're an API.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:13.240]   But if you can't scrape these pages, for example, a lot of sites don't let you scrape legally.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:18.120]   So if I wanted to actually aggregate meaningful data across Facebook,
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:22.600]   I would have to use a scraper and run through all these ad pages.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:28.280]   And that would be both against their terms of service and time-consuming as a reporter.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.320]   So I would like just to step further.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.440]   I would like just that little step to make it easier to aggregate this.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.520]   And I know that people on the web hate that, but that's kind of,
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.000]   they're using it.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.560]   It's using the same tools they do to police them, basically, in the media.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.520]   So let me ask you both another question.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.000]   Just let this test in here.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.680]   So Jackie Spire, representative from California, all but ordered
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.080]   Schugel to pull RT off of YouTube.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.000]   What do you think of that?
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.760]   No.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.160]   So talk about that.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:19.560]   I don't believe the government should dictate what content makes it on what platforms.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.040]   So Twitter pull down Facebook Twitter, Twitter,
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.880]   Twitter, full down Sputnik and RT, right?
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.960]   Because those are widely considered propaganda arms of the Russian government.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:40.360]   But, but, and I can't stand them and I've been asked to be on RT and a refuse.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.840]   And so I think they're awful.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.440]   You could make the argument that Fox News is a propaganda arm of the US government.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.880]   So I don't think that should, I agree with you that this probably.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.360]   Yeah, that's troubling.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.520]   And I wonder, by the way, the precedent we set here that that I tweeted this and
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.160]   nobody's answered.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.640]   I wonder whether Voice of America and the State Department and the CIA also
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.680]   product advertised.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:08.120]   Deutsche Vella, BBC have international outreach.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.000]   Putin can consider the BBC propaganda for democracy.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.400]   We set by point is the precedents we set are dangerous.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.560]   And in the hearings from both sides, I'm not doing false balance here,
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.760]   but I heard both was basically a another way to demonize foreigners.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.520]   Is it foreign?
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.400]   Oh, yeah, they're foreign.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:27.960]   They should be allowed.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.040]   So the fact that no, we'd be more international.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.080]   So Fox is protected because they're a domestic operation.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.360]   They're protected by the First Amendment.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.440]   Is, is RT protected by the First Amendment?
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:36.680]   No.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.920]   Because it's out of the Russia.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.720]   Is it?
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.200]   Um, well, no, they have an operation here.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:42.600]   Right.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.400]   No, they're, they're, they're, they're protected by the First Amendment.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:45.720]   Okay.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:52.120]   So why is what representative Spier suggests is of violation of the Constitution?
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.160]   No.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.240]   If she, if she makes it happen, yes, it is.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:59.560]   Now, if, if, if YouTube decides to take it down on its own, then no, that's YouTube.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.560]   YouTube can, YouTube has the right to edit.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.840]   Editing for free speech.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.400]   They can do that.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.600]   Private entity can do that.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:11.320]   But now we have Congress pressuring YouTube what they should and shouldn't put in their platform.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.760]   Well, and we have another question.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:18.440]   What Stacey described as an API so that the press, that all of this transparency is meaningless
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.600]   unless we have a strong free press.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.880]   Because we expect the press to do the homework and reveal.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:30.600]   Because no one, I mean, maybe an individual will do it, but, but then they become the press in the
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.000]   fact.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.640]   So that, that's the strong free press is important.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.480]   So you don't want to see it undermined even to the point where they say, well, we're going to ban
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.120]   propaganda arms for foreign nations.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:40.360]   No.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.840]   And the other, the other, the other, the propaganda arm and let, you know, let people decide, let
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.400]   people decide.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:52.360]   But you also have to, I mean, the strong free press also has to be better at doing this job.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.160]   But I know I harp on my own people here, but, but somebody has to.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:01.320]   I go back to the 150 million, 126, 150 million people.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.800]   We don't take our journalism to where the people are.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.240]   The manipulators do.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.480]   We don't inoculate the public against the lies that we know we're going to come from the manipulators.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.600]   Yes, they have to come to you still.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:20.360]   And so there's a real problem here in the architecture and structure of that fourth estate.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:28.200]   I don't think people, I think that it's a part of the problem, but I do think the good stories make
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:36.760]   it out to the people. But I also think that journalists are kind of, we're not in some ways,
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:44.280]   we're not doing our jobs. We are not learning how to access data widely.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.880]   We are not learning how to write compelling stories.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.280]   I mean, I love 538.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.400]   My God, some of their stuff is so didactic. I'm like, good, kill me now.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:05.160]   So we have to, as journalists, figure out how to pull the data and turn it into a compelling story.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:11.560]   We know the story. I mean, journalists were aware of Russian influence on Facebook in the elections,
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:16.200]   right? They just couldn't figure out how to get the data they needed to tell that story.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.600]   And it was very much a data oriented story.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:28.360]   I feel like there are some J-schools that are not doing a great job at teaching journalists
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.920]   how to think this way. I think journalists often in newsrooms don't have the time to allocate
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:38.600]   towards training people and making them better. And there's also the mentality of just send people
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:44.360]   click farming, basically. Yes, that's a larger problem as the business model, which motivates
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:49.480]   us to go for clicks, not for understanding, not for value. And even I was at a war economic
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.360]   forum event today. And there was a time we said, let's get past clicks and get to attention.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.920]   Attention will be good. People are realizing that no, attention is just as corrupting and just as bad.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.640]   What are the metrics? What are the goals of media journalism? What are we here to do?
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:12.200]   We have a big group of problems. We can't just, amen, we can't just blame what I fear is happening
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:17.080]   is we're blaming the technology companies. And the technology companies being heuristic and being
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   secretive are bringing it on themselves. But there's going to be danger to the internet. Number one,
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.600]   because government is going to come in and do stupid stuff. And number two, we're not looking at ourselves
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:36.040]   in an honest mirror and seeing what we have to do, what role we have. I think we need a truth
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:41.880]   and reconciliation commission for media and platforms after this election, not because
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:46.040]   Trump got elected, but because the quality of discourse in this country is suffering badly.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.640]   We all have a role in it.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:57.960]   And I would also say that journalists, I mean, the tech media is not great because we tend to
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:05.080]   laud tech companies. But journalists need to, I mean, I don't know a single journalist out there who,
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:10.520]   when you mention an oil company, doesn't immediately assume that they're being lied to about many
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:17.080]   things if it comes from an oil company executive. But they hear Facebook say something and to a
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:24.680]   point, this is better. But they think, oh, okay, yeah, Facebook. So I think there's also a lack of
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:31.320]   we were too trusting. We were like, oh, Facebook, you got to do this yourselves. But really,
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:37.080]   as a challenge, you just got to say, you know what's happening? I think we're going, I think we're
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.880]   we're getting an overreaction the other way now, we're getting a downright moral panic.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.520]   My God, was been talking about how we're in a moral panic right now, which he defines is when
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.720]   the public isn't really upset, but media and politicians try to convince them they should be
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.880]   upset. That's a moral panic. Look at the New York Times yesterday, which I thought had a horrendous
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:43:00.200]   piece, which was how to fix Facebook. Number one, that's the New York Times saying Facebook is broken.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:04.840]   I don't think most of the users think it's broken. Number two, seven or another nine ideas in it were
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:12.840]   just absolutely absurd and stupid. Let's take a break. I might want to look at what's wrong with
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:18.840]   Facebook and what the nine experts Farhad Manju and Kevin Rus who both of whom are tech journalists,
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:24.200]   right? And some of the ideas were good. Some of the ideas were really on. But you want to go to a
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:31.160]   commercial. Yes. Save that. Save that sigh for one minute from now. I want to hear what you have to
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:36.840]   say, Stacy. Hold your breath, Stacy, this entire time. Don't turn blue. Your hair can turn blue,
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:41.240]   but not you. Our show today brought to you by video blocks by Storyblocks. We all know that
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:49.160]   good video clips, good sound effects, a big hero image on your block, make a big difference to the
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:56.200]   quality and to the readership and to the enjoyment. Both you and your readers will have. So this is
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:01.480]   what I want to tell you about because normally it costs so much money to get great stock footage.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:07.640]   Video blocks from Storyblocks, video blocks download all the stock footage you could ever want.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:15.720]   Their member library has a 115,000 studio quality HD videos after flex to after effects templates,
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:20.760]   motion backgrounds and more. And it's all royalty free. Of course, you can use it for commercial
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.640]   or personal projects and you and everything you download is yours to keep and use forever. There's
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.360]   no time limit. There always are new clips going up. There's always something fresh to download.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:38.360]   All of that for $149 a year. Many other sites you'd pay that much a month or a week. No, this is
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:45.320]   a year. $149 unlimited access, unlimited downloads. You pay that and you don't have to worry for a
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:52.920]   whole year. You just use all all you can eat. Plus, if that weren't enough, they've also got a
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:59.080]   marketplace and I love how they do this marketplace. This is the original artists selling their
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:06.280]   stuff to you directly. They take 100% of the sale price. That's more than 5 million additional
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:11.480]   videos. The video blocks does not take a cut of this. This goes right into the pocket of the artist,
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.040]   which I love. I love supporting that. As a member, you get 40% off.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:25.320]   There is no reason not to do this. We were using another service. We switched immediately.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:32.520]   And it has saved us thousands of dollars already. From now on, no more old or outdated footage,
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:37.080]   no more watermarks. If you're just downloading it and using it, no.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:43.160]   Pay for it. 90,000 customers, NBC, National Geographic, the History Channel, the Travel Channel,
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:48.280]   all use video blocks footage you should do. Go to videoblocks.com/twig
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:55.800]   and you'll get all the stock video you'd ever need for one flat $149 a year rate. That is a
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:03.560]   great deal. And 40% off the marketplace, which adds millions more clips. Videoblocks.com/twig.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:10.600]   Save on millions of studio quality clips. Great stuff for the best price anywhere.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:18.600]   Really love this video blocks by Storyblocks. Go to videoblocks.com/twig.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.120]   Let me thank them for their support. I need a doctor for my students.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:28.600]   Oh, yes. I don't know if you've priced out any of the other companies, but it's really expensive.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:35.160]   You often pay per clip, which that really isn't an inhibition against using them.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.480]   But yeah, if you have students making videos, instead of them having to
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.160]   remember to shoot the B-roll of Times Square or whatever, they can get it.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.600]   Well, students should remember to shoot their B-roll.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.040]   Oh, all right. Yes, I know.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.800]   All right, teach. You're right.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:50.680]   I'm just saying.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.400]   Shoot your B-roll.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.800]   No, I know. You got to spray. You got to do it.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.440]   You got to get it all.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.800]   Actually B-roll is a lie.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.120]   Yeah, it is. It's just, you know what? This is what I don't like about TV.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:05.400]   Is that everything has to be covered by video. And so if you're saying something that isn't
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:11.080]   visual, is it a thought or a concept, something abstract, you still have to cover it with video,
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.800]   which is inherently not representative.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.120]   And I love, I have come to love with the Jump Cut.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:20.120]   Yes, me too. Because then it's the truth. We added it here.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.320]   Yes. None of this stupid turn around the camera, shoot the anchor going
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.240]   so that you can do an edit that's invisible.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.120]   I just, I agree with you, Jeff. I'm glad to hear you say that. That's great.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:36.280]   Nonetheless, you know, unless there are cases where you do one video, you do one.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.400]   You want to teach them and you want it.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:45.160]   Have you seen the, what is it called the, is it the sad stock photo feed?
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.920]   [laughter]
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.360]   No. Where's that?
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.160]   Oh, it's hilarious.
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.360]   Is it Instagram? Where is it?
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:50.760]   Sad?
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.520]   It's not a photo.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.000]   Oh.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.840]   That, that's dark stock, dark stock photos.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.080]   Darkstockphotos.com?
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.160]   No Twitter, Twitter slash dark stock photos.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.480]   The one from October 22 is unbelievable.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:10.600]   Twitter is actually a good place for visual feeds too. I don't know if people
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:15.320]   realize that, but I follow history and pictures and stuff and it's really fun to have those.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.000]   Oh, these are sad.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.680]   These are hilarious.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.120]   What the hell is going on here?
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:20.840]   Just hilarious.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:25.320]   They're playing mumble peg, a bunch of almost naked kids with this
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.160]   mean grandma.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:31.880]   Grandma is teaching a mumble peg and one of the kids that looks like missed.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.920]   That's, that's dark. That is dark.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:39.160]   There's the ladies. What is it? Ladies.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.080]   Oh, I'm following this one.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.600]   [laughter]
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.760]   Are these really Getty images?
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.800]   Yes, as far as I know.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.720]   So, you know, there's a, oh, I was going to say,
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:55.160]   woman laughing alone with salad mean about stock art and women eating salad.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:55.560]   [laughter]
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.640]   Pretty hilarious.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:57.960]   These are great.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.920]   Oh my God. These are wild.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:01.400]   Let me see.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.920]   Is this, is this, um, I'm looking up one of them.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.160]   Oh my God.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:07.720]   Getty images.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:08.040]   Yep.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.720]   I just did a Google search on one of the, on the woman putting a knife in a toaster.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.080]   And it's on Getty images.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.240]   So don't do this at home, kids.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:20.520]   But I mean, I guess if you're writing an article about stupid things to do in your house,
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.640]   you would want that image.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:27.000]   I feel that you should have, you should have every day they should throw up like a
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.960]   write an article with this image challenge.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.480]   Oh, I like, I think it'd be super fun.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.840]   You do like that one, don't you?
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.800]   I do.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.320]   [laughter]
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.600]   So instead of boxing glove, you want a frying pan to pop out of the TV every.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.120]   That is actually a saucepan.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:44.600]   Okay.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.240]   All right.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:45.640]   Okay.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.520]   All right.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.120]   Okay.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.560]   This is, this is horrible.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.760]   I'm following this right now.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.200]   Follow.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.240]   Anyway, anyway,
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.520]   anyway, Stacy was signing.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.600]   How do we go?
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:58.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.320]   The side.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.760]   Let's, let's not go there.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.520]   Let's, let's move on from moving on.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.960]   Cause how to fix Facebook.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.960]   Far hot has become,
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:06.440]   how to fix Facebook.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.400]   Far hot has become a moral panic person.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.720]   He's, his new book is called the frightful five.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:12.520]   Yep.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.880]   The entire guardian is up.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.320]   The entire guardian is up.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:15.640]   The guardian, yes.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:18.600]   It's all, I'm glad you told me that because I agree,
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.880]   the guardian has now become technology is ruining the world.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:22.520]   Let's stop it.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:29.560]   Kevin Kelly, who is a good person to ask of, of wired magazine and a great writer,
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:34.600]   told Far Hot Facebook should reduce anonymity by requiring verification of real names for real people.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.280]   How often can we argue this case?
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.760]   How often do we remind people that, that,
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.080]   anonymity is necessary for people who are vulnerable?
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.800]   It's easy for a white man in America to say,
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.320]   everyone should put their real names out there.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.600]   It's not so easy for a gay man in certain African countries.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:53.960]   You'd like this one though, Stacy Eli Paris, author of the filter bubble
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.440]   and chief executive of Upworthy.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:56.760]   Okay.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:01.000]   Says Facebook should open itself up for independent research.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.960]   In effect, the API that you were talking about.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.160]   And I think that would be great.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:09.320]   Well, not just that, but also how it runs its
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.760]   various feeds and walls and whatnot.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.760]   But that's a lot to ask a private company.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.280]   That's like saying Coca-Cola should give up its recipe so we know what we're drinking.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:21.720]   Well, they could make it available just to academic researchers.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.560]   But they could limit it.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.120]   That is what?
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.920]   It's hard to control it and you've got to tell the academic researcher what they're not allowed to
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:29.400]   say about it.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.600]   Right.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.560]   I'm trying to get them to give up more data.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.440]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.560]   That's key.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.440]   It's going to lead to trust.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.800]   It's going to be good for them, but it's complicated as the problem.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.240]   And the price.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.760]   Well, it's a private business to do that.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.080]   Everything is complicated now.
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:45.640]   And you know what?
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:49.480]   We always say it's complicated and we shrug or we say,
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.240]   oh my god, this law will never happen.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.840]   We can't handle all this.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.480]   You know, the repercussions are unimaginable.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.840]   So let's not do anything.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:00.200]   I'm like, guys, we live in a complicated age.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:04.280]   Let's sit down and figure this out.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:04.840]   I know.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:09.320]   I would love to go and be in an office just to be like, okay,
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.120]   this is crazy.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:10.840]   This is a morass.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.840]   Let me make some unpopular decisions and then leave.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.800]   The last one is the one that killed me.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.280]   What it does though, and then we'll get to the last one.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:25.080]   What it does is it acknowledges that Facebook is not
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:30.200]   traditional business, that its impact on society is not the same as Coca-Cola's,
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:34.680]   that it has, you know, it has some, you know, higher responsibility.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:35.880]   I don't think that that's false.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.400]   I admit that Facebook probably doesn't want that to be how it's seen.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:43.960]   But don't you think it's true, Stacey, that Facebook has so much influence
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:48.920]   that it maybe has to have and Google and?
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:53.560]   Well, so this is the argument that people made about television or things like showing
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:56.200]   cartoons, not cartoons.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.720]   Television is regulated.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:57.960]   Television and
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:01.720]   And that's where I was going with this.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.600]   Oh, sorry, sorry.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.320]   And that brought us legislation about, you know, how much airtime that you could
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.640]   devote to ads to kids and a good thing.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:14.200]   So yeah, I agree.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.640]   Here's what Tim Wu says.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.320]   And I guess this is what you're talking about, Jeff.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.760]   Now, maybe you disagree with this.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:24.040]   Facebook should become a public benefit corporation.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.760]   No, I don't have any Facebook stock, but
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.320]   as a shareholder, you might not like that.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:31.880]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.240]   Yeah, yeah, or an employee.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:40.680]   I mean, this is this notion that communist, that a prophet's bad,
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.960]   prophets the root of all evil.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.040]   So if we just get rid of some of the prophet, then it'll be okay.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:50.280]   Or above, you know, from the Tao researcher, let's get rid of the emotions.
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:55.080]   Now I've asked for more, you know, instead of just the emoticons are there,
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:59.560]   it would be nice to have, I think, that's smart or something like that is one.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.520]   But Facebook is about relationships.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.720]   Relationships are emotions just because people are exporting emotions,
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.760]   doesn't make all emotions bad.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:07.720]   And let's get rid of emotions.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:12.760]   It's just baby and bath water is being thrown out nine times there or seven times.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:16.600]   How about Rokana, who is a California member of Congress,
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:20.920]   who says Facebook, we want more transparency.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.640]   You should explain your newsfeed algorithms work.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.480]   Well, all the plan.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.320]   Explain how you use data and targeting.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.600]   You should say how you make decisions about third party verification and removing offensive content.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.640]   That I agree with, right?
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:34.840]   I mean, there's some more transparency.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.760]   Yes, I think, you know, what does that define the old open up your algorithm is really mean.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.280]   Yeah, and that's like opening up Coke's secret recipe only more so.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.640]   Yeah, the initial order makes a similar point about transparency.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.000]   I absolutely agree with that.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.640]   But it matters about the newsfeed algorithm is really visible,
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.240]   which is what is the outcome?
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.960]   And anybody who reads the newsfeed can see the outcome.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.240]   And you could decide for yourself whether or not you want to read the
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:54:59.240]   newsfeed.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.120]   But everybody's outcome is different.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.880]   No, that's right.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.080]   You have to decide for yourself.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.360]   Am I seeing what I want to see?
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.040]   I should mention this.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.840]   First, when we talk about Facebook, I should give the standard
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.240]   full disclosure is that I started the news integrity initiative,
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.760]   which got substantial funding from Facebook,
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:14.360]   Craig Newmark, and the Ford Foundation.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.920]   I sound like one of those guys at the end of the commercial is telling you what they really have.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:17.720]   One very FJAC.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:25.800]   But I also had on Tuesday, I had an event at Q&E where Adam Massari
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:30.520]   the head of newsfeed at Facebook came in and talked for an hour privately with
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.320]   Audius development people.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:36.360]   And then we had a public event where Facebook presented a booklet that they actually printed,
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.920]   which tries to tell news organizations how they need to be smart in using newsfeed,
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.680]   which is a form of transparency.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.120]   It's trying to tell you what works and what doesn't.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.160]   Let's try to put it in a form that they want.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:54.120]   Okay, let's move on to something more.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:54.840]   Less interesting.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:55.720]   I'm tired of Facebook.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.800]   But hey, it's just something super controversial.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.280]   Okay.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:58.840]   Well, yes.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:03.080]   I think, what do we think about the Google Docs drama?
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.120]   What's the Google?
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:04.600]   It's not about queso.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:11.160]   So some people yesterday, I believe it was yesterday, oh no, maybe it was Monday.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.680]   I'm like, where are we in the week?
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.200]   But they're Google Docs.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:19.880]   They found themselves locked out of their Google Docs because they violated Google's terms of service.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:26.680]   And this was really interesting because, yeah, people were like, wait, what?
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:29.160]   Google's reading my docs and then, wait, what?
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.360]   Google could just lock me out of my, you know, articles.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.440]   This is based on the content of the docs.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.520]   Yeah, that's what the theory is.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.560]   They check for certain things.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.800]   So if I write a short story that has hate speech in it,
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:48.120]   because the antagonist is hateful, they could conceivably store it there.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.640]   No, but if you share it.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:52.680]   Ah, then you're just going to be the result.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:57.480]   But I mean, as a reporter, I mean, I share, I write stuff in Google Docs and,
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:03.400]   you know, share it with all kinds of my editors, my copy team, whatever, whoever.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.720]   So according to Mashable, National Geographic reporter Rachel Bail
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:12.600]   was locked out of a draft of a story she was writing about wildlife crime.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:16.600]   So the New York Times articles.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.960]   So it's AI.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:23.320]   So Google says it's an error and they fixed it.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.680]   Yes.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:28.600]   But they said it was one of the experts the New York Times quoted,
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:32.440]   said it was Google's using advanced machine learning and other AI technologies to examine
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.280]   vast amounts of information in real time.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.040]   Like reading your docs.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.400]   Right.
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:42.280]   But so it could be an error in the way the AI was created, like all the other
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:47.880]   said AI errors, like remember, Tae for Microsoft or Google's photos that hated black people.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:52.280]   But it reveals that Google's reading your docs, which I, yeah, that's the way we knew
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.440]   they were reading them for the purposes of advertising.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:54.840]   Really?
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.600]   Well, those are a male.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.440]   They're not even reading my mail anymore.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.040]   But they're not even your mail.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:00.440]   You're right.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:00.600]   You're right.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:00.840]   You're right.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:03.080]   They were reading our Google Docs.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.760]   This is interesting.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:09.560]   Like I wanted to know, is this everyone or is this also like, like I have a,
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:10.840]   what is it called?
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.920]   The Google admin, the account you pay for.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:18.760]   So I have a paid Google account and some professional companies do this as well.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:23.000]   And if I were, if my internal docs and memos were being scanned by Google,
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.560]   that would be if after I paid Google, this is not again, the freestuck.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.520]   So all these people with Chromebooks
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:37.240]   are giving everything that's on that Chromebook to Google for their perusal.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.080]   That's pretty weird.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.800]   I know it's not by a human.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.240]   No, I understand it's machine.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.760]   So yeah, that's the moral panic when people say,
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:51.240]   somebody's reading your mail, but it's not somebody, something, but still.
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:57.240]   And they can lock you out, whether by accident or intentionally.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.720]   We don't own that doc.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:00.760]   They own that doc.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:05.880]   That was what I thought was most disturbing slash something we should probably,
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.400]   that's one of those complicated things.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.600]   We should probably figure out.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:11.640]   Google says this was an error.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.840]   They changed a rule and it automatically flagged a lot of people, but.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.960]   Here's what Google says.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.560]   They said this yesterday.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.640]   Technically, we don't read files.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:27.000]   Instead, we use an automated system of pattern matching to scan for indicators of abuse.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.600]   Though it can identify clusters of data that might suggest a violation,
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.840]   the system does not pull meaning from the content, according to a company spokesman.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:41.160]   So what that means is, in effect, they're doing a grep for hateful words.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:46.440]   And if the, if the N word is in your doc, they don't look at what's,
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.000]   which is frankly even worse, they don't look at what's surrounding it.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.680]   They just say, oh, you're using the N word a lot in there.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.200]   That's hate speech, which is obviously dangerous.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:58.360]   I mean, okay.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.920]   So they're not looking at the meaning or context of what you're reading.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.800]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.080]   If you're, well, it's the same problem that when, when Google,
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.120]   we've talked about this in the show, when Google started accounting for the authority,
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:15.640]   reliability, and quality of sources, trying to get hate speech out of search results,
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.960]   search ranking, well, guess what happened?
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.600]   Some liberal sites that were complaining about hate found themselves demoted.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:27.240]   That's the problem with these rhythmic solutions like this.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.560]   But this is very concerning.
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.880]   I don't, uh, wow.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.920]   I hate like to get locked out of a document.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:41.400]   I mean, imagine and to not, and we all know that Google is pretty sucky when it comes to
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.640]   trying to solve problems quickly for you, right?
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.960]   No one's like, oh, Google, you're so awesome at customer service.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:54.840]   So I think this probably leads to dear God, Google, so many people depend on your things.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.760]   You got to make your customer service better.
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:03.080]   Cause yeah, a lot of people are like, oh, the lesson to take away from this is, you know,
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:08.840]   computers are reading your documents or that, um, what is it?
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.320]   Oh, gosh, I forgot the other lesson.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.000]   Okay.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.720]   Let's be, don't own something that if you're going to create something,
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:22.840]   whether it's a photo or a article or a short story, you should put it somewhere you own.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.480]   Or all this stuff should be encrypted and nobody can read it.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.360]   If you encrypt, not the government, nobody.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.440]   Chromebook doesn't really, well, I guess it does.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.320]   You could put, there's a mini lock, for instance, a mini lock Chrome extension.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:40.600]   You could in theory, save locally, run it through mini lock and then put it on your Google drive.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.440]   No one's going to do that.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.640]   No, no, no, it would have to be designed by Google.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:49.720]   Well, no, they have a Chrome extension that's not designed by Google.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.080]   It's called mini lock.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.600]   No, I'm saying if you're going to make it easy.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.400]   We'll make another end.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.240]   Yeah, but that, yeah.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:02.280]   But my question, so there are terms of service say you're not allowed to post hate speech and other stuff,
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.960]   but I'm not posting it.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960]   I'm writing a private document.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.760]   Let's share it.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.200]   The question is, if you share it.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:08.920]   So this is all.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:15.400]   If you see, I, I think that if you made something public via Google Docs and it had hate speech
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:19.960]   and Google was put in a position of, of distributing that, I can see Google saying,
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.680]   oh, no, we have some right to not be the vehicle for this.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.000]   But that's hard enough to imagine I please that.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.360]   But it has no different in a sense from saying that hate speech doesn't belong on Facebook or Twitter.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:41.880]   So, so Google as publisher, blogger or Google Docs publishing, I get that.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.000]   But anything short of it, anything that's mine, and I share it with you, Leo,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.120]   we have a private relationship and you asked to see my short story.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.040]   Um, no, Google should not be inserting itself in there.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:57.800]   Now the next period is what's Google doing not just for itself and its own liability.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.000]   What's it doing in terms of government?
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.720]   And bail, by the way, says that her account access was restored yesterday.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:09.320]   Google says it was a bug, but it still raises to me this very interesting issue.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:15.080]   And of course, one response is, well, you shouldn't have your only copy anything on Google.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.560]   Don't write in the CMS.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.680]   Yeah. And so, yeah, right.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.720]   Don't write in the CMS.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:24.120]   And so Rachel's effect says that she's not going to do that anymore.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.800]   She's not going to write on Google Docs.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:29.960]   Although if you're in a Chromebook and you're, I mean, that's all you can do.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.840]   I write everything in Google Docs.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.040]   Or maybe not everything.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:34.840]   I write a lot of things.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.760]   I mean, because like what word, if I don't have to use word, yay.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.360]   Use it in years.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.800]   But now maybe you should use your word because at least you own your document.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.400]   Of course, by the way, Microsoft Word by default now sends, saves your,
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.600]   documents to OneDrive.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.280]   Which probably has a similar policy.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.360]   Well, it's bad enough that there was a document.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.200]   In fact, they shut down her entire account.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.880]   And as Stacy just said, they're not exactly responsive.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.600]   Do they?
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:08.040]   Oh, interesting. Nick Fountain, who does a podcast, says his podcast script.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.040]   He does, he's a producer of Planet Money.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:13.560]   Says his podcast script was blocked by Google.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.560]   That's an NPR product for God's sake.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.880]   Planet Money has no hate speech on it.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.280]   That's a news organization found in this account block because of what Google read in a script.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:25.960]   That's Google guys wise up.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.240]   This is why you're sitting in Washington sweating.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:34.760]   Yeah. And if you're going to do something like this, maybe don't do it to journalists because.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.720]   Yeah, I guess you're going to.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.880]   Well, it's interesting how many journalists use Google Docs.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:40.600]   We use Google.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.320]   You use Google.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.520]   We use Google Docs.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:46.200]   Yes, it's the best for editing because the comment system is real.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.960]   I mean, it's really nice.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.440]   Which we share all the time.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.920]   Right. I mean, Kevin and I share and we prefer.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:58.920]   I mean, our other option is who's going to send word documents back and forth.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.320]   I could say.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:04:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.360]   I could say.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.640]   You probably could use GitHub and Adam.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.000]   I mean, it's going to commit to GitHub.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:07.800]   So you have this other.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.280]   Good.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:08.680]   God.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.000]   No.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:09.480]   No.
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.040]   See,
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.640]   could you say the words GitHub?
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.000]   I know you don't like that either.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:13.320]   OK.
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.840]   And they don't have they have some there's some issues at GitHub as well.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.200]   So I thought that story was worth talking about because.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.560]   Now I'm wondering what I'm going to do with my pixel book.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.680]   You want it?
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:33.400]   Oh, Jeff, you're still going to use it.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.080]   Oh, you got it.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.240]   Oh, let's take a break.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.960]   Jeff's going to demonstrate his new Chromebook.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.560]   His pixel book has come.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.760]   Mine comes next week.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.360]   My pencil.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.880]   Did you already talk about your phone last week?
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.680]   Did you got it right?
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:47.320]   No, I don't know.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.480]   But actually, this is an interesting.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.320]   Oh, you got your which phone is that the Excel?
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.760]   The pixel Excel too.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.280]   Oh, well, I want you to talk.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.360]   Then you have many things to talk us to us about.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.840]   I have mine doesn't come.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.120]   I got a I got the Panda one the black and white one with the orange button.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.560]   So I'm not going to get it for weeks.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:07.880]   You have the case, but not the case.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.240]   I get it.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.640]   The pencil for the pixel book is coming tomorrow.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:16.600]   Well, I'm glad you got yours.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.760]   I don't know why I'm not getting mine because we did
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.640]   by roughly the same thing.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.920]   Jason Howell got his pixel to Excel.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.760]   And I was I thought the screen looks pretty washed out.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.880]   I did not think it was.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.240]   It's not a good looking screen.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:29.880]   It's a problem.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.920]   Nope, it's a problem.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.400]   All right.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.840]   Let's save that whole that thought.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:38.440]   And yeah, I mean, there are solutions that you can use.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.800]   People are pointing out next cloud.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.080]   I use a Synology NAS where it stores all my documents locally
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:48.440]   and it has Google Docs style collaboration features with somebody else.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.960]   So there are ways you could roll your own.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.000]   Maybe that's.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.080]   Is there an easy way to do an automated sync with Google Docs?
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.800]   So we talked about it in the past many times.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.360]   I wouldn't matter.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.080]   I remember.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.200]   I wouldn't do it with Google Docs.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.240]   I would do it with something else.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.760]   Do you have to do it with Google Docs?
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.160]   Well, I'm just all invested in Google Docs.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.760]   Well, maybe that's why I'm thinking.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.200]   Time.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:08.840]   Time not to.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.240]   Jeff, it's time to change.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.760]   Change your ways.
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.360]   No, not right in the CMS.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.240]   Did Omallik tell you that?
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.360]   Is like one of.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:18.600]   Okay.
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.000]   That's like journalism 101 these days.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.080]   Never right to the CMS.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:27.640]   I've written in so many platforms and that's always.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.080]   Yeah, you should write it locally and then paste it to the CMS.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.120]   Yes.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.800]   Although that comes with its own problems.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.800]   Actually, that's why some sort of hybrid solution where you write locally
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.360]   that it automatically sinks to a CMS would be interesting.
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.560]   One way sinking or something.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:51.720]   Hey, by the way, our show today brought to you by literally our 10 gigabit
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.840]   Symmetric Fiber Internet from Sonic.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.720]   I love Sonic.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.960]   And I love our high speed internet.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:02.520]   Now they're not, I suppose if you're a business in the sonic area,
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.880]   you could get 10 gigabit.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.920]   But you probably don't need 10 gigabit.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.080]   How about residential gigabit?
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:15.480]   1000 megabytes per second for $40 a month.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.880]   What?
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:22.040]   Everybody should have sonic and sonic's rolling out more and more of
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.120]   Northern California, the North Bay Area here.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.800]   The East started, they started up here.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.320]   The East Bay Area San Francisco.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.440]   Listen to what you get for $40 a month.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:35.080]   15 email accounts, a gigabyte of storage personal web hosting.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:39.560]   With a new domain, you get home phone service with unlimited local and long
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.040]   distance calling, fax line service.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.880]   It's easy to port your existing number over so you don't lose your phone number.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:51.240]   And gigabit 1000 megabits per second for only $40 a month.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:55.560]   And oh, by the way, it's the best internet service provider in the country.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.680]   All green checks, according to the electronic frontier foundation,
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.280]   because they stand up for privacy.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:06.440]   They have never cap bandwidth, friendly local customer support,
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.560]   and a price that just is unbelievable.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.880]   One of the things I love about talking about sonic,
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.200]   I know a lot of you can't get it, but it just shows you it's possible.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:21.800]   And so what you're paying for your internet service that's much more expensive and much
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.520]   less performing is ridiculous.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:30.040]   It doesn't have to be this way. And sonic's customer advocacy paves the way for a better
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.720]   internet everywhere in the United States.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:37.160]   So please, if you are lucky enough, and you can find out easily by going to sonic,
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.320]   s-o-n-i-c dot com slash twit.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:42.200]   Give me your address. See if you can get sonic.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:46.440]   By the way, if you join the internet revolution at sonic.com slash twit,
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.000]   you'll receive your first month of internet and phone service free.

[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:57.800]   You'll save $120 on your sonic bill if you bundle it with this sonic.com slash twit.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:01.080]   They literally bring you this week in Google.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.320]   Thank you sonic sonic.com slash twit.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:08.040]   So you got your pixel book.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.880]   One of the things Jeff and I did, we ordered it right away,
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.280]   but we ordered the 256 gig version and both of us went, what the hell?
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.240]   128 gigs Chromebook is more than enough.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.800]   Yeah. So you got the $1000 one as I did, right?
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.360]   Yeah, I did.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.400]   How'd you get it so soon?
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:27.160]   Just because I don't know. I guess I'm just important and loved.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.360]   Yeah. Good.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.120]   And do you like it? How long have you had?
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.000]   Yeah, I mean, it's beautiful. I went to a best buy before I saw it.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.760]   Like, you know, just see it. They haven't there.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.280]   It's lovely.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.280]   It does look pretty.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.560]   It's got that same styling that the pixels have with the kind of the clear top glass.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.200]   The keyboard has a nice as a nice travel, as they say.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:46.680]   It does.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.320]   Oh, good.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.800]   Yeah, I can't figure out the screen size is a little bit different in the sense that when I use
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:54.280]   TweetDeck, I'm getting the less on the screen.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:58.760]   Yeah, because it's a three by two or, yeah, I think it's three by two.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.680]   It's not a wide screen.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.520]   So that's fine.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.720]   I prefer that frankly.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.680]   I like it.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.360]   I was used to what it was.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.240]   You're right.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:10.440]   It's fine. It's nice. I mean, you know, it's not like the thing about Chromebook is that
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.680]   the hardware is the hardware. The software is the same.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.520]   There's no change in life.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.080]   It doesn't have the light that colored light on it anymore, right?
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:19.880]   It doesn't have the word to do.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.000]   The power the power wreck is.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.360]   Oh, look how small it is.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.560]   Oh, that's really nice.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.080]   Really nice. I want to get a few of those.
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.040]   Surely, of course, I got a complaint about everything.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:30.680]   That's what I do.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:37.240]   So, what I wanted to do was surprise you and just and halfway through the show say,
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.560]   I am on Skype on my new Pixelbook.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.360]   I did do that to you.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.560]   Thank you.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.600]   I saw Carson was on vacation.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.560]   I don't know who's at the board today.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.680]   I thought, no, it wouldn't be fair.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.200]   Josh.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.800]   So, I try to get Skype operating.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:54.760]   And I cannot tell you what torture, torture, it is Google.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:58.600]   Are you doing the Android Skype or the Web Skype?
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.600]   No, no, Android Skype works.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:05.160]   And the problem is that, of course, it's a G Suite account.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:10.040]   And trying to install apps on G Suite, because it acts like I've got to go to,
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.360]   the vice president or something or else in my company, which is me.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:20.120]   And so, I thought, well, I was going to download the apps to be fine.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:20.840]   No.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:26.680]   On this for some reason, the permissions had to be updated on half the apps, including Skype.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.040]   And it just says, go to play to do it.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.800]   I couldn't find where to do it.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.160]   I tweeted last night.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.040]   I was screaming.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.120]   I called Google.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.240]   There'll have been a hole for 20 minutes.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.760]   I finally hung up when I figured it out.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:40.680]   I finally figured out how to get to the app.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.120]   And then you'd never know what to click on.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:46.760]   I only did it by five or six different ways where I managed to click on the app to get to the page
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:50.120]   that tells me that it needs things to be updated where I could click the update.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.840]   Some of this is Microsoft's fault, I might point out.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.800]   No, it's not Skype.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.480]   This is all the Android apps.
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:59.080]   It is Android apps through G Suite.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:02.680]   It's just a nightmare of nightmares of nightmares.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:09.640]   And so, I can't rely on being able to remember again, because there are like 80 steps
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.240]   figuring out, I've gone crazy.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.240]   But it's designed to do everything you want to do.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:17.160]   So, that aside, it is a lovely machine.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.200]   It is lighter than the old one.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.080]   It is sleek.
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:19.800]   It looks pretty.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:27.160]   The silicon wrist pom-pom pads really feel good.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.720]   Now, have you tried tethering it to your Pixel 2 yet?
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:34.920]   Because I remember that was one of the features of automatic tethering, right?
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.480]   I have a grandfather at AT&T account.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.280]   Let me tell you.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.680]   Oh, I have a done one.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.320]   I get mine.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:45.160]   But, supposedly, if you just come, you don't have to go through all this,
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.880]   you could just say, "Oh, I see a hot spot on your phone.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.160]   I'll use that for the internet."
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.000]   Because they don't offer an LTE version.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.640]   Which still pisses me off, but that's life.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.760]   So, no, I love the machine.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.720]   It seems very, very nice.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:02.520]   It is expensive, but it's sleek and beautiful and thin and wonderful.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.880]   And it's a Chromebook, which I love.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:04.920]   Nice.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.680]   And then I have the Pixel 2 XL.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.840]   2 XL, which feels good in the hand.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:13.960]   It's very nice.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:19.480]   You know, again, it's so weird that I had two Pixel XLs because I kind of thought
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.840]   I'd ruin one, but it turns out I didn't.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:23.000]   So, I was going to send that one in for a $400 thing.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.680]   And then right before I'm ready, I said it in.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.040]   The screen went black and it won't come back.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.160]   So, $400 goes away.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:39.720]   So, I compared my working XL XL 2 because I've got the same screen saved with the same stuff.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.600]   Very washed out on the new one.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:50.280]   Second problem is that I don't know if it's a burn-in or a temporary image,
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.240]   but if you go to something like looking at all your apps,
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.800]   so the whole screen goes white and you're scrolling,
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.480]   you see the line and the home buttons instantly.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.600]   It's not done to do this.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.800]   Again, that may be temporary.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.200]   I don't know, but that's-
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.720]   Wait a minute, you're saying you have burn-in already?
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.280]   But I saw some reference.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.120]   I'm not sure it's burn-in burn-in.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.120]   It could just be image retention on the screen.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.240]   Or just Google calls it differential aging.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:19.800]   If you get it after a while,
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.960]   just go the best way to see it is to scroll up to see all your apps, right?
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.600]   When I do that, I can see a shadow line.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.240]   Oh, man.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.200]   I'm thinking this phone is jinxed.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.480]   This is not a good phone.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.520]   It's not a good phone.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:35.880]   The screen is problematic.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.160]   I'll be really eager for you to get yours and see what you think.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:47.000]   But it's fast with the battery, which I was raving about.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.960]   First day, it was a home all day, so it was fine.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:53.960]   Second day, I was at 10 in the morning, I was at 60%.
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.640]   I don't know what the heck it was running at night.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.160]   I don't like tilt bays.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.560]   40% loss by 10.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.520]   It's okay.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.480]   Today, it's okay.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.720]   So I don't know what I was running.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:10.840]   Right now, it's 61% at whatever this is, 10 at night.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.720]   I'm glad I didn't trade in my Pixel XL, my old Pixel.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.960]   This sounds very disappointing.
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.360]   I don't know.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.040]   But it's nothing wrong with it.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.320]   It's a fine phone.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.920]   Is it worth $1,000?
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.560]   Probably not.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:26.040]   It has issues.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.920]   Google for this phone that was going to be there, a special thing.
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.200]   They should have taken more care of with those.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.160]   Hey, what's wrong with it?
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.760]   I think they got a terrible screen.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:38.200]   It's always really when I looked at Jason's, it felt so washed out.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.040]   Now, I know they're going to push out new settings.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.000]   But how's the camera?
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.440]   Camera's good, but you don't care about that.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.000]   Yeah, it is.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.600]   The blue, when you turn, is very noticeable.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.400]   You're not going to see that thing.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.560]   Yeah, a lot of OLED screens do that.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.200]   I'm used to that.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:52.840]   That is a bottom.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.200]   I'm going to stick with my Note 8.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.680]   Maybe the Note 8 is the phone again.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.600]   I'm not screaming about it or anything.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:05.400]   But yeah, if I had two working Pixel XLs as I did a week ago,
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.040]   you might go back.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.560]   I might.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:08.520]   It's a lot of money.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:12.200]   That's where I am.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.880]   I like my normal Pixel, my small Pixel.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.240]   You're still happy.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:21.640]   We should say that Stacey has a Pixel 2, the smaller one.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:26.120]   And by the way, I apologize because last week I was acting as if it's not an OLED screen.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:26.520]   It is.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.800]   It's not an LCD screen.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.920]   I don't know why I was thinking.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.440]   It is an OLED screen, but it's an AMOLED screen, not a P OLED screen,
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:36.440]   which makes me think it might be a Samsung screen.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:36.920]   I don't know.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.000]   But I like it.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:39.960]   Looks good still.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.000]   Ta-da!
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   It works.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.880]   Wow.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.000]   Was it more than Pixel Buds either of you?
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.200]   I did.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.320]   I won't get mine though.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:02.760]   For, I think they come at the end of November.
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:03.400]   Yeah, mine too.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:08.840]   CJ is suggesting that, and I don't know how you feel about this, Jeff,
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.120]   but I am signed up for the Android beta on my old Pixel.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.240]   And I guess I will sign up for a beta on X, the 2XL,
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:21.400]   because 8.1, which is out now, has apparently some screen
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.040]   fixes.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.600]   Automatic or choices?
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.880]   I don't know.
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.320]   Probably both.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.120]   Probably both.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:34.920]   And of course, the iPhone X is coming out on Friday,
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.120]   but you're not an iPhone user.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:40.200]   Because everybody seems to say the iPhone screen is fabulous.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.520]   Although Apple, and I was curious what you would think about this.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.480]   You journalists.
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.320]   I got poo-pooed on Mac break weekly for my thoughts.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.520]   It was really interesting this year.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.520]   Apple did the most manipulative thing I've ever seen Apple do.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.200]   Maybe any tech company do.
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:03.240]   They parsed who got phones when, whose embargoes were lifted when,
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:05.640]   in a way, in a detailed way I've never seen before.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.960]   But Stephen Levy was a-
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.400]   I thought that was really interesting.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:15.800]   Okay, so there were a handful of people who got their iPhone Xs last week.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.760]   But it was a small number.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.040]   Stephen Levy was one.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.640]   David Pogue had begged, did not.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:24.760]   Mashable's Lance Ulanoff did, which I thought was interesting.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.400]   He's not your usual suspects.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.720]   Buzzfeed, Nicole and Wen at Buzzfeed did.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.800]   But the Wall Street Journal did not.
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.240]   Joanna Stern got it.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:35.640]   Did not.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.320]   She got a one day wonder.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.200]   So a number of people got a week ahead.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.560]   That's not unusual.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.360]   When the first iPhone came out, it was only the big four.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.840]   Stephen Levy, David Pogue, Ed Begg, and
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.920]   fourth one, I can't remember.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.880]   Walt Mossberg were the four from the-
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:58.440]   and they were from USA Today, Newsweek, Wall Street Journal,
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.560]   and The New York Times.
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.520]   They were from the big press.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.560]   That's 10 years ago, boy.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.000]   We've changed a lot in 10 years.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.200]   Newspapers got, as far as I could tell, no advance.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:10.040]   But weirdly, even the people who got a week ahead of time
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.040]   were embargoed till Tuesday.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:15.160]   Stephen Levy was the only one that was only embargoed to Monday.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:18.920]   He got a 24-hour lead on everybody.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:19.720]   So he got the-
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:20.520]   People hate that.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.120]   Well, okay.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.800]   That's not all.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:27.240]   A number of YouTubers got phones,
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.640]   but also a lot of big publications did not get phones.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.720]   I think Joanna Stern didn't get one initially.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:39.160]   The biggest upset was John Gruber of during fireball
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.080]   who's carried out a lot of water for Apple.
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.200]   Did not get anything.
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:44.200]   Oh.
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.880]   And later he did.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.680]   Marcus did.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.600]   Marcus Brownlee, because he's a YouTuber.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.520]   So they favored YouTubers.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:54.440]   A YouTube site called High Snowbiety did.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:57.880]   So it was really-
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.720]   Apple really parsed it finally.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.480]   Clearly they had marketing goals like reaching out to young people
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.960]   and YouTubers and stuff like that.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.000]   But they were very-
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.960]   But some people got it for instance,
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.800]   Neil I Patel of the Verge.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:12.600]   Big.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.080]   I mean, I don't think there's anybody bigger in this business.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.240]   Got it for one 24-hour period.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.280]   Which has the further effect,
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.360]   and this is to me the most damaging thing,
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.400]   of forcing all of these people to do a review within 24 hours.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.200]   That's-
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.240]   That's wrong.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:33.800]   So almost all the reviews that we saw with the exception of Levy,
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:37.240]   Matthew Panzorino, Nicole Wen, a few people who had it for a week,
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.560]   were based on having the phone for less than a day.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.280]   It's not long enough to test a phone.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.880]   Not long enough to test battery life.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:46.680]   Not long enough to look for burn-in and other issues with the screen.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:50.440]   Not long enough really even to test face ID
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.960]   and to see how it changed over time and different lighting.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.360]   It was-
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:22:00.760]   And so there are some who thought that including some analysts who thought
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.000]   Apple must be hiding something.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.600]   It was that weird.
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.640]   So I thought this was-
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.960]   Now Apple's right to do it.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.320]   They have a right to do it.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.920]   You know, that's what happens.
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.600]   I thought it was offensive,
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:18.120]   not to the people who didn't get phones, but offensive to the public.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:18.920]   Yes.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:26.600]   Who have a right to good, solid, well-planned reviews and didn't get them.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.800]   So Stacey, what do you think?
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.480]   Many things.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.720]   One, I hate when-
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:39.080]   I mean any reporter hates when a company offers an embargo on something
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.680]   and then somebody else actually has an earlier embargo.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.200]   That's total crap.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.120]   In most companies, in most reporters,
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:49.800]   if they can, they will try to refuse to work with companies that work that way.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:50.680]   Yeah, you can't, right?
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.280]   You can't say no to-
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.960]   So this is a thing.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:58.040]   I mean, like when we were at GigaOM and again at Fortune,
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:02.280]   we saw a bump every time the Apple reviews came around.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.680]   So you saw a huge bump in your traffic.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.360]   And we're talking, you know,
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:09.720]   million page view kind of days.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.880]   You know, those were not crazy.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.160]   And that's all tied to Apple.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.600]   So that's a-
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.360]   It's hard to say no to that.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.240]   I don't think it's wrong for Apple to go after this audience.
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.960]   I don't know if they're hiding something or they're just like
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:29.080]   seeing an opportunity to change the way that reviews are done.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:35.240]   And it's possible when you go and give your phone to a YouTuber who
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:40.760]   maybe really enthusiastic about technology, they may also be good at it.
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:47.240]   They may not offer the same tests that a historical reviewer,
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.240]   like somebody who's done it forever.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.360]   I'll go a step further.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.440]   I think they may be much more susceptible to buy it.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:55.080]   To be bribed or-
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.760]   To be basically being bribed.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.000]   And that's true.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.760]   I mean, Stephen Levy is the
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.040]   shiniest, happiest, journalist I swear out there.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.640]   He's a smart man, but my God,
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.680]   I've never seen him write anything negative about the companies he covers.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:15.080]   So in his publication, I mean,
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:21.640]   back channel, medium, now part of wired, that's just weird.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:28.840]   So yeah, I don't like it, but it's up to the establishment to say,
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:31.640]   okay, you know what, screw you Apple, we're not taking your product at all.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.120]   Most Apple coverage is almost fine.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:38.040]   And big publications like Recode were forced, were limited.
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.320]   I mean, you don't want to miss those those views.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.720]   So they're limited to writing review of the reviews.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.400]   Shit.
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:49.560]   Yeah, I mean, companies have done this sort of thing.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.560]   They punish people all the time.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.880]   Apple's a very vindictive company this way.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:25:00.840]   So yeah, I mean, I, and that's one of the reasons it's challenging for me to talk about this,
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:05.400]   or anybody or John Gruber, because then they get you get labeled a whiner.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:10.600]   And I don't expect a review unit from Apple, or I don't take review units from any company.
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:15.160]   I buy all my phones because I don't want, mostly because I don't want to have anything to do with
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.120]   these PR people.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:21.800]   So I wasn't bit by this because I wouldn't, they didn't offer and I didn't accept.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:25.560]   But I'm clearly on Apple's, you know, list.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.520]   And because I'm not, and not sufficiently reverent, I don't know.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:36.360]   The fact that John Gruber didn't get one, and I, you know, this, who knows why,
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:39.800]   but it might have something to do with the fact that from day one, he said the notch is ugly and a
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.560]   bad idea. He's normally very reverent.
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:48.760]   And it could just be Apple changing it up and saying, you know what?
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:54.600]   I want like, I actually, so this is, this is stories.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:59.000]   This is not actual data, but I was hanging out in watching my daughter.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:06.360]   She, she was testing for her black belt. So there were lots of like teenagers and young smartphone
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:12.120]   owners. And most of them were saying really that there was this conversation I was listening in on.
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.760]   And they were talking about how the iPhone six is the best.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.120]   They've got a headphone jack. They're all excited. They're like glad about that.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.200]   They were like talking about the X and they're like, it's so expensive.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:27.480]   It doesn't seem like it would be useful and even my parents don't want it.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:32.440]   So I thought that was kind of interesting because Apple does seem to be doing a harder
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:36.760]   sell around this phone than normal, but it is a new phone.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:41.720]   If you look at the reviews too, I mean, all the people who had it early, I mean, maybe it's a
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:48.440]   great phone. Nicole Nguyen says simply put face ID is really effing impressive, but that's because
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:59.800]   it's invisible. My friend, Renee Richie, who got the 24 hour phone says the best product Apple has ever
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:08.360]   made. You know, I mean, it's digital trend. Should you buy it? Our tentative response is, yes,
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:12.680]   we can't peel our eyes away from the gorgeous OLED screening using gestures to move around iOS
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:19.320]   is pure bliss. The verge one day they had it. The iPhone is clearly the best iPhone ever made.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:27.800]   Unon and on and on. Are the reviews all positive? Yes. Does it deserve all positive views? I don't know.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.440]   I'll let you know when I get mine in a couple of weeks.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:40.120]   But I just it's their right to do it. You know, if I were a shareholder, I would say good good on them.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:45.800]   They're increasing shareholder value. But as a user, I think readers should complain.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:50.760]   In fact, at some points to come backfire on them, some points will complain.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:54.040]   I don't know. They're taking it. They're right. They may not complain, but they're going to be
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:59.960]   taking advantage of because they're they don't know they don't see the systemic problem here.
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:08.200]   Well, and they'll still read. I mean, I guarantee when somebody gets the phone at, you know,
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:13.480]   recode or if you get when you get your phone, people will still look to see what you think about it
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:17.400]   if they're the type of person who reads reviews. Right. And right now, I just won't
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:23.000]   get those million hits because mine will be in two weeks. I wrote you might get it over time.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:29.800]   I said, yeah, I said in my tweeted, looking forward to my my first look instant review of
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:35.800]   the iPhone and 500 hours. That's it. It'll be November 17th. We will have an iPhone 10 in the house
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:42.440]   because we all we buy them. I make my I have I pay for my staff to buy them. So Megan
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.240]   Moroni's getting one. And she got in earlier than I did. So she's getting hers November 3rd
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:53.640]   on Friday. My wife got in earlier than I did. She's getting hers November 10th. Mine's the 17th.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:59.240]   Anyway, you know, it's probably a tempest in a teapot. And I know it comes off that I'm
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:06.120]   winching away because I didn't get one. Oh, the media loves talking about this. I mean, my goodness.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:10.760]   I just I feel like it's my colleagues and we're all like, oh,
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:17.880]   even they got it. Who else got it? What's happening? Yeah. So yeah, I just I feel like it's a disservice
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:22.440]   to buyers. And let's hope buyers are smart enough to. There's no urgency. And frankly,
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:27.000]   if you order it today, you won't get it for six weeks anyway. So you can't for a thousand bucks.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.320]   I imagine most people are going to be like, I'm going to read a bunch of stuff.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.240]   Well, and it's not just a thousand bucks because Apple's strongly pushing Apple care.
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:41.000]   Plus their extended warranty because the cost of repairing just the screen is $279. So
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.120]   well, let's talk about that with Google. So Google extended the so I bought the extra care for the
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:51.960]   both these devices. Google extended the one year warranty for the new phone to two years because
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:57.720]   they know they got problems. So I think they should be a discount on the on the extended care. They did.
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:02.920]   Your discount? Not a discount. You will. I can't remember what they solution was. They either have
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.960]   three years or they're going to refund you. I think they're going to refund you as I think
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:08.760]   what they decided to do. Well, no, because the difference is the extent otherwise I just get
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:12.920]   rid of the extended care. But that that covers accidental damage. Whereas the warranty only
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:18.120]   they had some plan with this. I can't remember what it was. Oh, okay. I like I haven't told me.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:23.800]   Quick complaining, Jeff. It's solved. That's what I do. That's what I do here. That's my job.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:29.720]   I really think I might be complaining about the pixel too. I'm worried. Maybe I should
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:33.640]   what I might do is trade it in for the smaller one as you the one you have because you have no
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:38.920]   problems. There is no way. You had the click and buzz problem. I have the clicking in the background.
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:46.600]   Is that fixed yet? No, it's not fixed yet. So the solution so far is to turn an FC off, I believe.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:53.800]   So here's the thing. But I don't it's very soft and I don't notice it most of the time.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:58.520]   And I'm not on the phone that often. So here's what Google's doing for you, Jeff. They're
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:03.480]   eliminating the deductibles for warranty repairs. What do you do?
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.400]   Jeff, I think you should go out and drop your phone.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:12.840]   Given that. Oh, wait. No, that's user warranty repairs. I never buy these
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:20.840]   warranties anyway because I just never use a phone that long. So that drop it or scratch a big deal.
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:30.920]   This just in President Trump has quietly set aside plans to require new cars be able to wirelessly
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:36.520]   talk to each other. According to the AP jeopardizing one of the most promising technologies for
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:41.800]   preventing traffic deaths. This was a proposal last year from the Obama administration that all
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:46.040]   new cars and light trucks come equipped with the technology enabling them to transmit location,
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:51.400]   speed and other information 10 times a second so that your car could talk to another car saying
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:57.080]   I'm this way. I'm over here. Watch out. And you would, for example, know when a car is about to run
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:05.480]   a red light and your car could stop. Trump administration has decided to let industry officials say
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:10.920]   the Trump administration has decided to let the proposal languish partly because of a reluctance to
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:19.080]   impose costly mandates. But no, this okay. So this is really strange. The V2V stuff like, well, one.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:25.080]   Okay, there's a couple of things here. It was supposed to go into effect in 2017, which is now.
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:32.760]   This has been around for a while. But we've now for Qualcomm just released their V2V modules that
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:39.160]   made it super easy to implement this either through Wi-Fi or cellular. So it could be that there's
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:45.240]   still some standardization efforts. This may not just be like a Trump is just his admin just
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:52.440]   wants to dismantle everything. It may be the tech isn't quite ready just yet. So before we freak out,
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:58.440]   we should we should know this a little bit more about the why.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:03.880]   Frankly, it doesn't bother me as much as the Google emoji for the cheeseburger.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:12.440]   That is the stupidest thing ever. Can we just say this is I it's fun and silly, but like Sundar,
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:19.640]   do you really need to? Oh, he's just having a relax. I'll bet I'll bet he knows a good case
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:25.720]   on what he sees. It started with a tweet from Thomas Beekdall who said, I think we need to have
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:30.040]   a discussion about how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger while
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:37.080]   Apple puts it on top to which the CEO of Google replied, we'll drop everything we are doing and
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:42.120]   address this on Monday. I have no word yet whether they did if folks could but agree on the correct
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:48.360]   way to do this. Actually, it's fun to read if folks can agree. So maybe he's waiting for agreement.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.520]   Inafried says, well, maybe you could leave it up to each hardware maker to decide,
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:59.080]   but then people would complain about burger fragmentation. The the the real problem is not the
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:06.120]   burger, by the way, it's the emoji for beer. Let me see if I can find this, which unaccountably
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:17.640]   has the foam floating in air. The beer, the mug is half full and the beer doesn't touch the foam.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:23.880]   The foam is just sitting on the top, which is very strange. That's a pretty that strong foam.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:28.520]   Maybe you drank the beer through the foam and then the foam just stayed there.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:36.600]   It doesn't look like anybody else's. Who's doing these emojis, by the way?
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:45.240]   Google's the only one with the cheese on the bottom. I found a Dan Pashman piece from 2011 on NPR
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:51.400]   that said you should put the cheese on the bottom, which oriented the cheese tongue word in order
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:56.280]   to maximize the cheese. I've actually heard a number of people say that plus it protects the
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:03.640]   bun. Here's the beer Stein and clearly Apple has is a winner in the beer Stein emoji department.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:08.760]   Look at what's next. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait a second. Apple's looks like
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:14.360]   root beer. Maybe it is. Maybe it's it's a hoppier beer. It's an IPA.
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:22.840]   Of course, of course it is. By the way, is there a queso emoji? Oh, I wish there were because I
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:27.800]   could use some right now. It wouldn't look like Chipotle. I'll tell you that guys. Now I'm hungry.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:35.400]   There was yours has nothing in it has no little bits of pepper. At least it has cheesy goodness.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:40.840]   No spices. You do need a spice in your case. Otherwise, not enough, but some.
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:48.920]   You were so spicy in there. There was just yellow pale yellow cheese. At least it doesn't feel like
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:54.680]   mud on the tongue. Good case. Oh, is thick, Jeff. You don't want to drip it off like.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:36:01.320]   I agree. And and Moses thick and Chipotle is water. But look at this. See, that you see, it has the
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:06.120]   little bits of pepper and parsley and stuff in it. That's what it should be like. You don't
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:13.800]   parse it. No, no parsley. No parsley. In your case. So, okay. Never mind. I thought the whole idea is
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:20.120]   it's kind of cheese with some with additional flavor. Yeah, it's cheese with like jalapeno,
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:27.880]   maybe some chilies, baby cheese, carnation, evaporated milk. Some people put onion in there.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:34.600]   I don't particularly like that. You're a case of purist. You know, you can buy a caseo in a jar.
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:42.040]   Is that any good? No, it's disgusting. I don't want fat free caseo. You know, I've tasted vegan
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:47.560]   caseo. They were selling. They were putting out samples in my local H.E.B. and it was it was not great.
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:53.400]   Don't recommend it. Okay, I'm going home tonight and I'm going to try a few different caseo recipes.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:58.840]   Oh, not not parsley. Cilantro. Thank you, Cobra, of course. Oh, there. Okay, that makes more.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:07.160]   No, no, well, cilantro is another kind of parsley, isn't it? Well, this is the old joke. I sent you
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:11.560]   to the store to get cilantro and you came back and parsley. Well, yeah, you wouldn't. My husband
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:19.800]   does that occasionally. Yeah. And didn't you actually tweet that? Possibly. He has. What kind of cheese
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:27.320]   would you use in a good case? So here's a recipe with Fontina. This is this is the Huffpo. Of course,
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.240]   17 caseo recipes you absolutely your life absolutely needs.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:40.680]   Green cheese. 17 of them. 17. I'm going to make them all. Smokey caseo. Skinny caseo dip. Pass that up.
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:50.920]   Chicken fajita case. No, no chicken. Vegan caseo dip. Beef caseo dip. The quesale machismo dip.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:57.560]   Caseo fun dito. Now that's you see, that's a whole other level. That's a different thing. Okay. So fun.
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:07.320]   D goes. Oh, it's a minute. Oh, hatch chili. Con caseo. Oh, hatch chili. Anything is so delicious. Oh,
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:13.640]   really? What's hatch chili? Thanks. New Mexico. What is hatch chili? Boss.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:21.480]   It's Stacy. What's hatch chili? What's hatch chili? Can you hear? Oh, can you hear Jeff?
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:28.840]   Hatch. Now I can. Yes. Hatch chilies are a type of chili that has grown in New Mexico and
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:34.440]   they're a good spice that's warm. They're a good flavored spice. They're very spicy.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:40.520]   They're not like ghost pepper. They're like a spice you can eat. Yeah. Sounds very good. They're
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:44.600]   seasonal. Yeah. I feel like February might be the season for Hatch chilies. I can't remember.
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:49.240]   Pimento in your. I hate pimento. It is an unholy.
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:55.480]   Right. Pepper. I saw one there that had beer and black beans. What do you think number one?
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:02.200]   A beer? Is beer anything to it? To it? Beer. I would do. Beer could work. No. No. All of white
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:08.520]   onion, garlic, two hatch chilies roasted milk, American cheese, Monterey Jack cheese. I wouldn't
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.840]   use American cheese. That's not really American cheese. American cheese melts like butter. Yeah,
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:20.360]   well, because it's not cheese. Well, I would put I would put beans in my case. So but then I'd
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:29.560]   probably be what? K so El Roja. Rojo. Conro. All right. Conrojo.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.640]   I don't know how we got back to case. We were talking about serious level like cheeseburgers.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:43.480]   My co-host. Google's pixel two priority. We want to case orders more than double last years.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:50.920]   So people are buying the I think people like the premise of a bezel-less screen,
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.480]   but that screen doesn't sound like it's very. Here's the other weird thing about it. So at the
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:40:02.600]   tie, it's not it's not as incredibly stupid as that for cock the Apple notch, which is the worst
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:09.400]   design I've ever seen. Yeah. This has you can't see it. It has a round.
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:15.320]   Oh, that's got you. It has a rounded edge on top. Oh, I have a fake round.
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:19.000]   Everybody's doing that now. Yeah. The bottom. I was doing that with the iPhone 10 as well,
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.440]   the curved corners. Yeah, it's kind of dumb. Yeah.
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:34.680]   So Roger Stone got banned from Twitter. I'm proud to say that the two people who blocked me
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:40.040]   are Roger Stone and Donald Trump, Jr. Nice. Not the president himself, though.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:42.920]   No, I'm trying God. Lord knows I've been trying. Yeah.
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:47.160]   Do you actually at him? Of course he does. What do you think?
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:53.960]   I don't know. I actually. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I think he don't follow him. I refuse to
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:57.240]   follow him either. Yes, I want to add to his numbers. Yeah.
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:01.400]   So I put him in his own column on tweet deck so I can just go look at it.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:07.400]   All right. I'm thinking we could just take a break and get to our picks here unless.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:13.560]   Oh, I should mention this because that's pissing me off. So the telcos persuaded the FCC,
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:20.200]   the new chairman, Ajit Pai, to throw out the privacy rules that would prevent ISPs from
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:27.400]   spying on you and selling your information to third parties. Those are gone. So privacy
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:34.440]   advocates have gone to the States saying, yeah, maybe you could do something about broadband privacy.
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:44.120]   So no, the the F Verizon is now going to the FCC saying, you know what you should do? You
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:48.120]   know what you really should do? You should ban states from doing it. You should say, no,
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:50.680]   that's a federal. That's could only be a federal law.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:55.560]   Well, that's California is actually already started taking these steps.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:01.800]   Yeah, but the lobbyists for Google Verizon Comcast and AT&T collectively killed that proposal in
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:06.120]   California. But that's because they don't want state by state rules. Well, I understand that.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:10.040]   We need a federal role. They told lawmakers the new law would embolden Nazis,
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:17.880]   increase pop ups and harm consumers. What? What? What the what?
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.840]   Nazis bearing pop ups. Yeah. That's what I'm just saying.
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:26.360]   What the EFF, by the way, had praised that law and said it's a great template for states
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:30.360]   who want to stand up to giant ISPs and protect broadband consumer privacy.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.600]   But it would embolden Nazis. No, but it emboldened Nazis.
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:39.080]   So that bill is gone, by the way, we I like that bill as well. No, no, no, no.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:43.560]   Texas won't ever do it because AT&T is headquartered here. Also,
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:47.480]   we've never met a telco lobbying bill that we haven't signed.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:51.320]   Yeah. So and of course, Pennsylvania home to Comcast. So, you know,
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:56.360]   this is a sad story. You know, we had those terrible fires here. What I didn't know is
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:05.640]   that the millions of dollars worth of documents from the founding fathers of Silicon Valley,
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:11.560]   David Hewlett, William Hewlett and David Packard were burned in that wildfire.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:19.720]   A company called Keysight Technologies had had them. It was a spinoff of Agilent,
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:25.880]   which was an HP company. They had put them all in a modular structure, the business and personal
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:31.960]   papers of Hewlett and Packard appraisers said they were worth up to two million dollars in 2005.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:38.440]   HP staff archivists said previously they've been kept in special flame retardant lined vaults.
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:46.360]   But this company just threw them in a shed and they went up and smoke. They're gone.
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:50.040]   Of course, the funny thing is now there would be no such thing as documents because it's all
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:52.520]   on Google Docs. But that's why you got to take good care of them.
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:58.760]   Well, and we have digital, I think there's actually, I think very recently, an XK,
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:04.680]   XC, KD, whatever, on digital storage technologies or lifestyle of storage.
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:11.160]   It was pretty hilarious and true. So when you store these things, if you don't have the
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:18.360]   program to open it, I know, if you put them on zip disks, forget it. The great thing about
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:23.320]   just threw away a zip disk just two days ago. My husband was like, should you throw this away?
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:29.080]   Do you know if it's cleaned off? I was like, a, nothing important. B, who's got a zip drive?
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:34.120]   Do you have a zip drive? Yeah, exactly. No. The great thing about digital data,
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:39.720]   writes XK CD, is it never degrades hard drives fail, of course, but their bits can be copied
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:44.840]   forever without loss. Film degrades, paint cracks, but a copy of century old data file is identical
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:50.200]   to the original. If humanity has a permanent record, we're the first generation in it.
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:56.680]   Amazing. Oh, this is the one praising it. Yeah, hold on. Now let's find the one condemning it.
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:04.360]   Previous, boom. Digital resource lifespan. It's 1909. I got it. I got 1909.
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:12.120]   X XK CD. Oh, number, number 1909. Yeah, this is a little bit later. He wrote that 1683.
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:20.280]   Go fast forward 300 panels. Book on subject will work forever. PDF.
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:27.160]   Web database site goes down back end data, not an archive.org. Java, front end no longer runs.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:35.560]   Mobile app. Broken on new OS, not updated analysis software. Also broken on new s not updated
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:42.120]   interactive CD, ROM CD, scratch new computer has no CD drive anyway. Library microfilm collection
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:47.960]   still works. Elizabeth Eisenstein is the great scholar of Gutenberg drink.
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:54.920]   She bragged, I had a conversation with her interview for public parts. She and she
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:46:03.320]   said quite proudly, Gutenberg's Bibles around 500 years later name any of your modern stuff that's
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:08.120]   going to be around five papers, not a bad medium. If it's acid free, you know, it's the best
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.720]   paper. Was it film? Yeah, exactly. There were some some in vellum, some on paper.
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:19.560]   Vellum is is is leather, right? It's cowhide. Yes. And then the Irish she just made from
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:27.400]   reads. Many papayra still exist. Thousands of years later. Or we could chisel on a rock.
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:35.720]   There you go. Like homorabi stone. The New York Times talk about Evan Essent is now available
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:40.360]   as a tour onion service. Actually, this is really good news for people who are in countries where
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:46.440]   the Times is blocked. There is. I first read this as a New York Times onion edition. Yeah, really.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:51.240]   There is a not let me give you the well, I don't want to give you the address. Well, I'll give you
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:59.160]   the address NY times three X, B F G R A G H dot onion. You have to use a tour browser, but that
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:05.640]   means people in China and other places where the Times is fully blocked. Now can read the New York
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:09.560]   Times and I think that's a great idea. Facebook does this. They did they did this for a long time.
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:16.120]   ProPublica does it. I think that's that's really great. But is can I complain about one more thing
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:21.960]   in the run down one more thing. So Google now when I'm in other when I want to see what's going on
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:26.040]   other countries when I want to get a sense of other languages, I go to Google dot de Google
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:33.880]   dot far. I can't do that. You can't do it anymore. And it's just it's Google. No, and I have friends.
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:38.760]   I have a very good friend who is German who lives in London. And every time he tries to go to German
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:43.160]   stuff, wants to translate it to Google, let us decide this stuff and let us decide it easily just
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:47.960]   by going to the other domains. You can never go to a settings thing somewhere. But yet to change
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:52.360]   the whole settings for the growth. Jesus Google was fine. What were you? What are you mucking around?
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:59.800]   Leave it. Leave it. Google works. Enough. Why? Why? How are they just applying this?
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:06.760]   Can you explain? Leo, I really couldn't understand the rationale. It could be in response to countries
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:14.280]   like France and Germany and the rest of the gotten well, they said not but or so if you wanted to see
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:20.440]   what was if you're in let's say you're in Germany and article has been erased in the German Google
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:27.640]   at at Google dot de thanks to a request to the right to be forgotten or gprd.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:37.560]   G T T R then you could go to Google dot com or Google dot, you know, EU or somewhere else and get it.
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:45.720]   Is that why? No, no, they said here. The change isn't supposed to affect how Google handles legal
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:50.040]   requirements such as the removal of right to be forgotten. Okay, Google says it's making the
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:53.880]   change because one out of five searches is related to location and the company feels it's critical
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:57.880]   to offer location information to provide the best results. I thought they always do this because
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:03.080]   when I was in France, even though it's my account logged into my account, I get Google that far,
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:06.520]   which is ridiculous. I thought I always did this. They always did this.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:13.000]   But I can't go to the bottom of the page type in Google dot de if you wanted to go to Germany,
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.360]   you could do that. Now you can't do that. Can't you go to the bottom of the page and say I'm not
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:21.240]   where you think I am. There's some kind of thing. They used to be able to do that. No,
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:25.960]   that's not that's not there. People want local results whether they want them or not.
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:32.520]   Jeff Bezos heart breaks a little.
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:37.560]   Greeting out all bunnies Amazon headquarters pitches. You know, Amazon's looking for a
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:43.400]   second headquarters cringing as he scanned the section touting the city as the economic and
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:50.680]   cultural core of New York state's capital region. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos reportedly felt his heart
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:55.400]   break a little while perusing Albany's pitch to host the company's new national headquarters.
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:01.800]   Oh, geez, he said, you could tell they put a lot of work into this sad presentation. They even
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:07.080]   provided a concept sketch of our headquarters across the river from their little Amtrak station.
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:11.720]   Said Bezos noting that the package was included. A custom made Sunni Albany great
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:16.600]   Danes football jersey with Amazon written on the name plate laid out the many ways a new
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:22.840]   $5 billion campus would benefit from being situated nearby such landmarks as the New York State Museum
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:29.400]   and the egg a performance art center. The proposal referred to as iconic. It talked about how the
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:34.040]   port of Albany has one of the biggest grain elevators in the country or something and they
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:39.400]   keep calling themselves the next tech Valley. Bezos said, God, I don't think that I have the
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:43.960]   stomach to read the section about how much will love their tulip festival. This is the onion,
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:52.360]   but boy, it sure is good. I can hear Bezos laughing when he reads it to that honking famous
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:56.520]   honking lab. This is exactly what I heard too. Well, I thought of that when you mentioned,
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:01.560]   or when we were talking about onion redder, I thought, Oh, what the onion. I love the Jeff Bezos
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:08.120]   article. Anything else we want to talk about? Stacy, any IOT news that you do. I'm going to cover
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:15.720]   it in my pick. Okay. Nice. How about you? Two for one. Two for two for. How about you, Mr. Jeff?
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:19.800]   No, I got in my last complaint. Last complaint. All right, let's take a break and we will get our
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:26.280]   picks of the week in moments. But first a word from cap Tara. So many times people call my radio
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:32.680]   show and say, Hey, my boss said I have to find software for our business. What do you think about
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:37.560]   doggy daycare software? Is there any really good stuff out there? And I have to say, I don't know.
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:43.660]   But that's probably better than Googling doggy daycare software. I got a better solution. Cap
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:53.800]   Tara. It's a free website with hundreds of thousands of reviews from real users like you for 400
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:59.080]   different categories of business software. I wonder if they have doggy daycare. I just made
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:05.480]   that up. I bet you they have like a kennel software and stuff like that. Yeah, kennel software. Here
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:13.080]   we go. So did you know that there are many, many choices in kennel software? But wait, you might
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:17.880]   say, how do I choose? You could Google this, by the way, you wouldn't get nearly this complete.
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:22.680]   So what you do is you go over on the right to the filter results. Now, you know, all I want to see
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:29.960]   four star reviews. I want one that's web based and I want pet birthday tracking and photo management
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:35.080]   and pet grooming. Now I'm going to filter the results and we're going to narrow it down to 16
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:40.600]   products. You can look at the thumbnail descriptions. Learn more if you need. How about ginger, the
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:48.360]   leading cloud software for pet daycare. Look at that or paw loyalty. It's more than software or pet
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:54.520]   as that. I'll add them to my comparison chart press compare now. Then I've got, I love this.
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:59.560]   Oh, they're going to say, how'd you hear about us? Make sure you say podcast and make sure you say
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:06.920]   T W I G. That's how I heard it. And then you're going to look in this and chart and you're going to
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:12.440]   get everything you need to know what platforms, how much it costs additional features screenshots.
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:21.640]   But the best part is more than 400,000 reviews from actual users. They're carefully vetted.
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:25.800]   This is really a great solution. I don't know why more people don't know about capeterra,
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:30.200]   but I'm doing my best to spread the word. Don't wait. You won't waste your time on free trials
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:36.440]   that go nowhere. You won't get, you know, nobody's going to connect with you or call you or anything.
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:40.040]   That's not how it works. It's a it's free free. You don't even have to sign up. You don't have to
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:47.560]   give many information. C A P T E R R A dot com slash twig. Let them know you heard it on twig

[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:23.400]   for their support of this week in Google Stacy kick it off with your pick of the week with you.
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:31.480]   Okay, this week's pick of the week is come to me. I got mine today too or yesterday.
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:37.000]   It's the Echo Silver. The Echo Silver and a station.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:43.560]   Anastasia is the Amazon. Oh, there's the Amazon label. I was trying to give it to you guys.
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:50.520]   Amazon Echo Plus. And so everybody silence your bottom A's. Okay. Well, do you actually,
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:54.120]   I don't know if it's going to sound different or not. It basically sounds a little bit better
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:59.960]   than the original echo, but the important part here is this has Zigbee. Mine came with the Phillips
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:06.280]   H light bulb. So in effect, that's cute. One. That's cute. One one. You light bulb. So it
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:14.760]   in effect, it replaces the hub. Well, so here's the thing. If you are like me and you already
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:20.600]   have a home hub, I'm not going to recommend this because if you've got a hub, you probably also
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:25.320]   have something like that runs Z wave, which a bunch of other devices like this, like the smart
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:30.360]   things hub does Zigbee and Z wave, right? We can smart things both do Zigbee and Z wave.
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:34.360]   And I think that's a better way to go for now because there's still lots of those devices out
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:40.760]   there. The other thing to know about this is that Amazon, I just whacked myself in the head with it.
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:47.000]   Heavy substantial. Actually, it's plastic. They say it has better speakers though. So it must be
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.160]   it does have better. I can play it for you. No, it's all right. We wouldn't know because it's.
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:56.760]   I've got a dot next to me so you can compare the dot to the. That's pretty cheesy.
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:05.160]   But what was I going to say about this? Man, I forgot. Oh, it only does bulbs.
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:11.720]   What? So when I yeah, when I asked it to turn off the lights in my room, it only did
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:18.520]   the bulbs. And actually, this was not just this. This is Amazon's new. So tied to this,
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:24.600]   Amazon changed their interface for the Madam A app. So what you've got now, and I'll turn my
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:29.320]   brightness down a little bit so you guys can see also turn off night, late. But it does do
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:35.560]   everything. I mean, sorry, echo does normally. Yes, it does. It's a complete. In other words,
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:38.840]   it would be a reasonable replacement if you're buying an echo right now.
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:46.280]   But it's got a more expensive. Yeah, yeah, a normal. So if you don't, it also as I should say,
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:51.880]   it has the call the direct calling capability that the new echoes have, the old echoes don't have
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:57.800]   this. But here's what happened. The interface is now different on Madam A. I don't know if you can
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:02.760]   see. So yeah, it's very different. It's totally different. This looks more like smart things,
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:08.520]   something like that. And what you can do is you can now set groups. So I've got, I don't know if
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:15.080]   you can see my master that is Madam A enabled. That means when I stand in my master bedroom,
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:26.040]   I've grouped all the lights in there and a fan to be under the echo that's in the master bedroom.
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:31.160]   So when I walk in there and I say lights on, it's supposed to turn the lights in that room on.
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:38.120]   So I no longer have to say turn on master bedroom. In reality, all that does is turn on bulbs.
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:44.280]   So it's only working certain devices. It doesn't do all of them. And I'm wondering if that's because
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:50.600]   they just started with bulbs or that's part of the bulbs in Zigbee are good friends. So this is
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:55.000]   something for the Amazon Plus. I don't know. But those are, that's kind of two things I'm
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:00.680]   telling you about now. But those are my two picks or one is really not a pick. It's just advice.
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:06.280]   Like it's a good product, but don't buy it if you already have a hub. I got the echo look.
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:15.960]   Oh, I got, I declined that. You know, I said, they didn't even tell us they just, I just went
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:22.040]   there and said your invitation is, is ready. Oh, they told us, you know, I wanted to do the fashion
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:27.480]   stuff, but I didn't want to spend that much money on it. I know. I did it. I did it so you don't have
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:32.920]   to. So it has a when you're done with it. I can send it to you. Would you like it? Yeah,
[01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:36.680]   because I really, I just didn't want to spend out of my own. No, you should have it. I don't need,
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:41.640]   I don't need it. So I wish you could see this better. There's no way to see these pictures on the web.
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:48.920]   Is there? I don't know. So what it does is it, I go up every day, I go up to, in my office,
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:53.160]   I go up to the look and I say echo, take a picture and it takes a picture. By the way,
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:58.440]   look what it does with the picture, which is kind of cool. It blurs, it first of all,
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:02.680]   zooms in a crops it and then it blurs out the background. So you're, you're kind of like standing
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:09.160]   right out there. So you can really see your outfits. Well, that's so the AI can really see your outfits.
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:14.040]   Yeah, some of my outfits. Oh, I'm the best. And then
[01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:20.200]   this is why I'm sending it to you, Stacy. And then this one, I don't know what happened. It took a
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:24.360]   picture, but it wasn't me. It was like, it took a picture of the TV. I guess I didn't have it pointed
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:26.120]   right. So it will, will.
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:35.240]   Series talking to me, go away, Syria. Nobody wants you. So then you could set it the style check.
[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:41.480]   And I created a comparison. And it said, rightly so, that this outfit was, see, he's got the yellow
[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:46.840]   check that was better than that outfit. That one I looked like. I don't know, an Uber driver.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:52.120]   This one, this was weird. I thought my suit looked better than the sweater, but it's, but, and they
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:58.120]   based on a variety of criteria. And they also good percentage waiting. So it was actually pretty
[01:59:58.120 --> 02:00:02.840]   close. What's working in this look, pieces work better together, compare it to another look,
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:06.360]   you can add another photo. So you can give it your outfits and compare.
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:16.360]   You know, it's, I mean, that's it. It has a terrible speaker and no Jack. So you can't get
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:21.960]   better audio out of it. Yeah. So that's why, and you know, I'm actually, as I'm thinking about
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:27.960]   right sizing my echoes, and I was actually going to dump the echo show. Oh, I like this show. I use
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:34.840]   that all the time. Well, nobody calls me on it because nobody wants that. No, no, that's okay.
[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:39.720]   No one calls me on it.
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:42.280]   Except for Leo and Jay.
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:47.320]   Who I met in very nice. I won't call you. I won't call you. Don't worry.
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:53.320]   Watch my corgi videos on YouTube on it for anymore. So I know that's annoying. And I'm hoping that
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:59.480]   YouTube will rethink that that was terrible. So I'll, I'll trade you. I'll send you a look
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:05.720]   if you'll send me your show. Oh, okay. That's not really fair. The show's $30 more. I'll tell you
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:11.960]   what I'll trade you. I'll trade you for your show. I'll trade you a look, a dot, and a player to
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:17.160]   be named later. I don't want any more players. Also, I'm getting rid of the dash. Would you like
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:23.080]   the Harmon Carden evoke the Cortana player? Well, the Cortana that was so exciting.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:27.320]   Would you like that? I'm trying to write size too. I have echoes. I have practically
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:34.280]   have echoes in my shoes now. I have echoes way too many echoes. I just got as a get like a speaker
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:40.040]   gift. I'm like, what do we need that in this room right now? I have three echoes. Yeah, I don't
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:44.200]   need that. So that makes me think, what would Maxwell Smart have for technology if the show
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:49.720]   restarted today? Would he have an echo in his shoe? Yeah. Hello, chief. This is my shoe echo.
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:56.280]   All right, Jeff. Oh, right. My turn. Where was I here?
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:01.800]   I haven't, I haven't, I haven't. We already did the Halloween costumes when you were at her
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:08.040]   here. Don't worry. It's fun. So, employees anonymously share which tech companies don't pay
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:12.680]   fairly which ones they want to leave. So really interesting stuff here is that Netflix employees
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:18.120]   are really friggin happy. No kidding. They're the happiest by far. So they asked, I'm, I
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:22.680]   forget how many people did this. I mean, it was a, you know, not a scientific poll, but it was a
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:28.600]   good number of employees. So Netflix employees are looking at what Apple is. They don't think they're
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:33.720]   paid. Yeah. Did they do women and men because that would have been interesting. Yeah. Would have
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:41.160]   been, would have been very interesting. So, so Netflix is on top like 4,174 people, but all,
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:45.400]   you know, all of them, you know, so I don't know how many Netflix employees.
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:52.440]   Yeah, it's, it's, but, but Dropbox next Facebook is third, nerd wallet, twitch, Snapchat, Tableau,
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:55.560]   Google's pretty far down there because Google has all these other kinds of employees now,
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:59.640]   right? Who probably aren't as happy? Yeah. Amazon's way down. That's not terribly surprising.
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:07.400]   Then they asked, I'm interested in changing my job. Yeah. Right. Netflix again, happy most of
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:12.840]   them say no 20 couple of percent say no, but Groupon 90 some percent 90 percent of Groupon.
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:18.520]   People said, yeah, I want to change my job. I'm not a Google looks to be about 58 percent.
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:21.240]   I can't I say about because Uber is a pleasure.
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:25.960]   Happ plays are are happier than Google employees in this respect. Well, they're waiting for their
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:31.560]   and I was Google's app here than Apple. Apple's happier than Amazon. And they're all happier than
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:38.760]   Twitter. And if you look at the compensation satisfaction versus job change interest,
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:43.240]   it's a correlation, not surprisingly. Oh, yeah. Yeah. More you make Netflix
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:46.520]   folks that are fairly compensated and aren't looking for jobs. Yeah.
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:49.800]   Interesting. This is interesting. Yeah.
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:56.360]   The article is in Business Insider and it is a survey by.
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:05.800]   Forgot it's very somebody somebody. Oh, the blind app. So you have to use the app called blind that is
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:11.800]   designed to service service to do this, I guess. Yeah. Sounds like secret service.
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:15.400]   So I don't know. Is this crazy? Does anybody still use an Amazon Kindle? I do.
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:24.760]   Oh, I'm getting mine. It just after three months, I got the new oasis. Yeah. Oh, this is the newest
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:30.520]   Kindle. This is the one. It's a little pricey. It's over 300 bucks. It's waterproof IP.
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:36.840]   I can't remember the number, but it's two meters for up to an hour. So it's really waterproof.
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:43.480]   It has a float. That's a good question. That's a very good question. The life,
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:48.200]   the battery life, they say is much improved. I have to say it's a much faster processor. The
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:51.640]   effect, if you could show the others, maybe if you could show a close up of the screen,
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:57.160]   I could show you the page turn. The page turn is much cleaner than before. It's just it's almost
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:00.840]   instant. And they don't have that. If there's a graphic, you'll have a weird flicker. But if
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:05.720]   you're just going from text to text, it's very clean, very fast without any of that flickering.
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:12.440]   I guess this left hand or it goes either way, the right hand side, depending on how you hold it,
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:17.800]   contains the battery. That's why it's got much better battery life. I'm weirdly puzzled by the
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:22.280]   it's too bad they didn't do a type C charger. It's a micro USB charger. But given you're only
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:27.720]   going to charge it once every few weeks, I guess I can live with that. On/off switching a charger,
[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:37.240]   the only thing it has, it does come with LTE, the whisper sync built in. It has pretty much all
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:43.400]   the same features. 300 DPI is, say, the paper white back lit, very nice, easy to read. You can
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:49.960]   adjust the brightness, of course. I'm using it with Wi-Fi, but you can also use it with LTE.
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:57.400]   I have to say, it's very light, very easy in the hand. It's easy to hold.
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:05:59.960]   Can you flip it if you get tired of holding the book in that hand?
[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:04.440]   Totally. Totally flip it. It's very easy to turn the page by touching the screen,
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:08.840]   but it also has physical page turn buttons forward and backward, forward and backward.
[02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:16.200]   You see how nice the page turn is? The main reason I use this is so I can read in bed because it's not
[02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:22.040]   as bright as any, even a very directional light. You can read in bed without disturbing your
[02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:26.360]   partner. It's really good for that. I have to say, I'm disappointed. The other reason I got it is
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:33.640]   they say it'll play audible books. It will. It has a section for audiobooks. It sees your whole
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:40.600]   audible library, which is nice. I can filter it down to just audible book, audible stuff.
[02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:44.440]   Here's my whole audible library. I can download it, but it doesn't have any speakers. You have to
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:49.800]   pair it via Bluetooth to a Bluetooth speaker, which I did. I actually paired it to an Amazon Echo
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:54.360]   that worked very nicely. I can already listen to audible books on Amazon Echo, so I'm not sure
[02:06:54.360 --> 02:07:01.960]   what the real advantage is here. The one thing I wanted it to do is call it—I can't remember
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:09.400]   the name of it—but as you're listening, it highlights the text like karaoke. It doesn't do that,
[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:17.160]   which is a little bit disappointing. It specifically doesn't do that. When you listen to a book,
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:22.680]   you're in an audible interface. You actually have the audible app up there. You don't see the text,
[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:28.920]   which is extremely disappointing because that was my favorite feature when they call it
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:34.200]   immersive reading when you have the audio and you're watching the text. Otherwise,
[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:40.520]   it is a really nice Kindle. If you still don't use a Kindle on your tablet, you like the E-ink
[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:48.680]   for whatever reason, I think this is a very nice reader. I'm pretty happy with it. Boy, it's light.
[02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:54.120]   It's very light. It would be really nice. I don't expect to have a speaker, but it would really
[02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:57.160]   be nice if it did the immersive reading. I thought that was such a nice feature.
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:08:00.680]   And of course, she couldn't do that. Can you speak that? I read so fast, I think I would get
[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:03.880]   behind, so I'm curious. What do you mean? Speed up the audio?
[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:11.720]   Well, I guess— You're not—yeah. Let me see, actually. That's a good question.
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:17.480]   Audio book readers—I think the audible audio book reader will let you
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:22.600]   read it a faster space. Let me see. Let me see if I can do that. I can 200%.
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:28.120]   It's like the—yeah, this has speed. In fact, it'll go 300%.
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:30.280]   Presents. Yeah. Okay.
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:35.320]   So, yeah, you can speed up. And I presume then, if it had a immersive reading, it would speed up,
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:41.480]   but it doesn't have immersive reading. So, who knows? It has a story you can buy as, you know,
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:46.920]   unlike your iPad, which, you know, is—the buying is separated from the reading. But,
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:50.680]   yeah, I'm happy with it. I really am—I'm very happy with it. I got it because I want to—
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:56.920]   A, I want to read in a tub, and B, I want to take it on a trip. We're going on a sale. My son and I
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:00.760]   were sailing around the Caribbean for Christmas, and it'd be nice. It'd be nice to have something
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:03.320]   that's whoa, whoa, waterproof. You're right, it doesn't float, so I'm gonna have to attach a
[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:06.520]   floaty to it. Because who cares if it's waterproof, if it sinks?
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:11.640]   Goodbye, Kingdom. You won't have got an hour to get it, right?
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:16.200]   Yeah, yeah. I can dive, get it. And I just stopped it.
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:18.360]   And that concludes— Hold on, question. One last question.
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:24.200]   Or you can glue it. I read somewhere that I could run the virtual sim on this phone as my
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:28.520]   fi, and then still have my physical sim in here with my AT&T. You know if that's true?
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:31.800]   I don't know if that's true. It would be a virtual dual sim.
[02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:35.240]   Dual sim, yeah. Because the e-sim doesn't require a sim. I don't know that's a good one.
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:37.160]   When you get it, I won't—
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:38.760]   Because I have other sims, so I could try it.
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:39.560]   Yeah.
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:42.600]   I will try that for you and let you know in a couple of weeks.
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:45.720]   All right, now you can go goodbye. Ladies and gentlemen, actually, I'm trying to keep
[02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:49.240]   Stacey from eating. I want to keep doing this. So Stacey's not going to eat. She's going to be
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:49.880]   very hungry.
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:51.960]   Yeah, stop it. I will just leave.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:55.720]   Stop it. By the way, somebody's saying, "Does it read text?" Yes, it has a very good voice for
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:58.680]   reading text. But again, it doesn't have a speaker so you have to pair it to a Bluetooth.
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:02.280]   But it has an accessibility mode that reads all the controls. It would actually be great for
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:07.240]   accessibility. And I think the out loud reading sounds pretty human. Sounds pretty good.
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:08.840]   So, yes, recommend it.
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:10.520]   Is it using Amazon's poly?
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:10.920]   Maybe.
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:11.320]   Or is that—
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:15.320]   I can't play it for you because I don't have a Bluetooth speaker paired, but it's a female voice.
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:21.720]   And it's very good. It's better than it used to be. And I didn't mind it before, but now it's
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:23.640]   like you could really listen to it, I think.
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:32.600]   Well, we've come to the end of another This Week in Google. It's time for us all to break
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:36.200]   and eat some queso. And where are our fine queso shirts?
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:38.200]   Jeff Jarvis lives the queso life.
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:40.040]   What? No.
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:42.040]   In beautiful Manhattan.

[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:28.200]   No, not even when I was there. Not even when you could.
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:31.960]   You were very gentle. We're going to get to the case off. This is going to be tough.
