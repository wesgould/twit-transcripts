[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff and Gina are here.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   We're going to talk gossip. We're going to talk candy bars.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Yes, it's all about Google next.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   This is Twig.

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   This is Twig. This week in Google.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Episode 214 recorded September 4th, 2013.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   No, no, no, no, no.

[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   It's time for this week in Google. The show that covers Google, the universe and everything.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   We're doing it today in the old studio, which is fine.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   In the closing confines of the old Twitch studio, only because they're doing something else outside there, which we'll be doing later in the day.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Jeff Jarvis is here, professor of journalism at the City University of New York, the author of public parts and what would Google do, blogger at Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I'm Elo Jeffrey.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And an irascible irreverent critic of all that is Google.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   What do you call me, "irascible"?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   How dare you call me "irascible"?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I'm not irascible.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   He's also Jovial, kind and sweet.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Yes.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Oh, no, I'm sorry. I was describing Gina Trepani. She's the host of all about Android.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Been on air a lot this week. We'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   She's also a blogger at smartaward.org, the author of Think Up.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And hello, everybody.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Hi. So good to be here.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Boy, there's a lot to talk about today. I don't even need my notes.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Just a couple things.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Just a couple things happen.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I guess we should start, Gina, because you were here this morning with the Samsung announcements at IFA.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Berlin is the host of the big telecom conference IFA this year, as always.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And Samsung took this opportunity to announce three new products.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Do you want to summarize?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Sure. Sure.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   So Samsung announced the Note 3, Galaxy Note 3, the new Galaxy tablet, 10.1 tablet.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And the thing that I was really excited about, we all wanted to hear about the Galaxy Gear smartwatch.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And it requires the Note 3 or the tablet, doesn't it?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   It has to be a Galaxy phone. So it will work with the Galaxy, the GS4, for example.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   A Galaxy phone running for three.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Yes.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   So most GS4s have not yet been updated for three, but once you get that updated,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   that's right. The software update will come out in October.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   But it's so it's not just the Note. This is what I was worried about because they kept,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   they presented the Gear as a companion to the Note during the presentation.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And it was like, do you have to have the new Note 3 in order to use the swatch?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And that's not true. You just need to have a Samsung Galaxy phone and those updates will roll out over the next couple of months.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I'm wondering if that has to do with the infrared, not infrared, Bluetooth LE, Bluetooth 4.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Possibly.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Which is supported the GS4, but I wonder if OS support is not quite there.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Right. Right. Well, I think it's also going to work with the GS3 as well. Did that have?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   You know, Samsung jumped on LE early as did Apple.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   The nice thing about LE is it doesn't use much battery life.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And yet you can keep a communication link opening. This Fitbit is an LE device.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Right. Right.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   We work with the HTC One because it doesn't support LE and hardware.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And I guess that's probably why I'm sure Samsung wants to sell more Samsung phones,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   but at the same time, they probably also want to sell more $300 watches.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yes.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So I'm guessing it's hardware. It's a hardware issue as opposed to a non-competitive issue.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   But there have to be non-Samsung devices that have the hardware.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   The iPhone is the one that leaps to mind. I don't know if they'll ever support it.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   They're not going to support the iPhone. It's an Android device.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So it's an Android device, I believe that just doesn't have the keyboard.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   The battery life is supposedly around 25 hours.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   That's good.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   That's good.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   That's better than the leaks that we heard, which was 10 hours,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   which to me, as far as I was concerned, 10 hours seemed unacceptable.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Although some of the folks that tried them out, like at the Virgin,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Gizmo, who said that the battery was low, just when they're trying it out,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and the experience room there at the demo.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   So I don't know. I'd wait to see what that looks like.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   But the watch is, I happen to like chunky watches.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Well, first of all, I don't wear a watch anymore, but I used to wear a watch all the time,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and I always kind of like chunky watches.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And the watch is, it's large, but I would wear it.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I would wear it.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   It doesn't strike me as like, oh, that's a big nerd watch.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   That's going to announce what a big nerd watch where I am.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It's not. It's actually quite, I thought it was a lot more stylish than I expected.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It looks a little bit like a Casio calculator watch.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   That's it.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   That's it.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   That's it.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   A little bit.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   At least it's smaller than the Sony, which was also out.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   The Sony looks like a cereal box on your wrist.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   It's pretty sleek, though.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's got the stainless steel and the little screws, and like the screen,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   when it's black is nice looking, and I thought it was a little sleeker than your classic Casio.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   There was another smart watch announced today.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Was it Qualcomm?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Really?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Yes, Qualcomm.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yes, that's on the rundown.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Boy, we're going crazy with the strand watches.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Yeah, everyone's trying to...
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Does the Qualcomm not use Android? What does it work with?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It is Android, I believe.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   All of these, except what Apple does, will be on Android.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   It makes sense that Android is the operating system of choice here.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yeah, what's it called?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Tock, the Tock's Mort watch?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   It might be pronounced in T-O-Q.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Tock?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Tock?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Tick-tock?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Must be Tock.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Tock?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   It's also three-wheeler box.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   It's a new version of it, so you've got three smart watches out today.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   So that makes a trend.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   We've got an official trend going on.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Yeah, we officially have a...
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Here's a...
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Here's a video from somebody.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I think this is from the verge of the watch.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   So there's the camera, which is a wart on the band.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   It is that camera thing.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Yeah, it's a giant camera, and it's one point.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   So how do you have to hold...
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   You have to wear the watch on your right wrist, and then, yeah, you have to hold it up like this to take a picture, right?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Now I'm a lefty.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I normally wear my watch on my left wrist, so...
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Yeah, it looks like some strange, military salute.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Yeah, if you flip the watch around and wear it on your left wrist, the screen is not...
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It's upside down, isn't it?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Oh, there's a screen reorient?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   It should reorient, don't you think?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Well, I don't know.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It would surprise me if it didn't.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   But how do you see the picture of your take...
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I don't get it.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   You see the picture you're taking on the watch.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Right, but you're...
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   You've got to be...
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It's got to be down here.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   It's plastic or rubber band.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   They have different colors.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Nice screen.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   It's an OLED screen.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   You have to change it because the stuff is embedded in a band.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It doesn't look like it's...
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It's changeable, no.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Or you could just buy the ball.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   We're looking at a video that shows every color.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   One guy wearing them all.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   I think it's a...
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Really, you think women will wear these?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   They look kind of...
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Kind of big.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   They're big.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   They're pretty chunky.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I happen to be thick-risted.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Whatever that means.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I think someone with a small wrist that will look unusually large.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And I do think that there's a trend in chunky watches, but that's pretty...
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   It is pretty big.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I admit.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Even on this guy, I don't know how big he is, but it looks huge.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It looks like something Borat would wear.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   "Look at my American watch.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's from Kariya."
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I think we're in such early days on this wearable stuff.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It just is really ungainly at this point.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   What does it do?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   It's a major consumer value.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Yeah, what does it do?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   What do it do?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So it notifies you of text messages, obviously.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.720]   You can take photos with it and immediately share back to your phone those photos or share
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.640]   out to your friends.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.920]   You can issue voice commands to it.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920]   And I actually...
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.800]   We didn't get to see as much demo on stage as I would have liked to have seen.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.120]   But you can issue voice commands.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.640]   I think that it will even do things like translate signs.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.440]   So if you're traveling overseas and there was a sign, you could take a picture of the
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.840]   sign and it would translate for you with their Translate app.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.640]   I believe that there's an accelerometer or a pedometer.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.440]   Which is something I was interested in too, some of the health aspects of it.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.440]   70 apps?
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.440]   70 apps a lot.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.440]   They're going to have paths.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.440]   You know, social apps.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.440]   Are those apps resident on the watch or on your phone communicating with them?
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.440]   On the watch, right?
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.440]   You don't have to have the phone, or do you?
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.440]   No, for a lot of you do.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.440]   For communications, I think you do.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.440]   Yeah, you do.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   The watch has to be paired to the phone in order to do things especially like...
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.440]   Oh, you don't have any internet.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.840]   Yeah, but you can use the watch without that, right?
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   I mean, you don't have...
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.840]   Right.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.440]   You just don't have any internet access without...
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.440]   Right, you wouldn't have internet access.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.440]   Right.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.440]   But the watch still works.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.440]   So if you watch, we'll probably tell you the time, yes.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.440]   Well, I should be able to take a picture still and stuff like that, right?
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.440]   Right, right.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.540]   Yeah, so if you take a picture without internet connectivity or without being paired to your
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.240]   phone, I guess it just stores the picture there and sinks back when you do pair to your
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.240]   phone again.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.240]   Right.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.140]   Does it have...
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.940]   You know, it's got a pedometer in it.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.260]   It seems so trivial, but it's got a...
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.340]   It's a health watch.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.140]   It measures your steps, right?
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.180]   Yeah, I can measure your steps.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.140]   And that's all I saw.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.140]   I don't know if it's ever been...
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.340]   You know, how rushed by just about anything.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.340]   This isn't doing it for me.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.340]   It's not getting me out the door.
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.340]   No.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.940]   Especially not that you have to have a Samsung phone.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.340]   Well, that's a very good point, yes.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.140]   You know, if it worked with my HTC One and it was maybe a hundred bucks less, I would
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.140]   might consider it.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.840]   And by the way, somebody's pointing out the GS4 does all of that.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.740]   This is what puzzles me about these watches.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.540]   Your phone already does most of everything, right?
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.540]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.340]   GS4 has a pedometer and all that stuff.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.020]   It's wearable in the sense that it's in your pocket.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.340]   If you're a guy, it can be right in your shirt pocket, which is pretty handy.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.420]   It's right there.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.340]   If you've got a Moto X, you can even talk to it.
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.340]   Hello.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.340]   But I don't know if I want to wear glasses.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.060]   I don't know if I want to wear wristwares.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.940]   I love wearable computing.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.260]   I love the idea of making it more accessible.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.580]   But I don't know if we figured out how it works.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.740]   Hey, surprise.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.740]   You got a new email.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.740]   No S.
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:00.220]   And you can't respond to the email.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.220]   You can't do anything.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.300]   Does this have, can I use S voice with this?
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.300]   Did they say?
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.300]   Yes, you can.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.300]   So I can dictate to my hand.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.300]   You could.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.300]   Yes, you could.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.300]   It's a cute looks silly.
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.540]   Okay, Google now.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:18.380]   Tell Jeff I'm not buying it either.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.880]   I guess.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.380]   Can you make a phone call that way?
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.380]   No.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.300]   Or we can see a lot of morons walking down the street talking to their wrists.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.300]   Like Dick Tracy.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.980]   I want to be in the Secret Service.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.980]   I don't know.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.780]   It feels like such a it feels like there's all these companies are doing this because
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.260]   they heard Apple was doing it.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.820]   Yeah, it does feel that way to.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.660]   And they want to just quickly get in the market with whatever piece of crap they can
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.660]   because they know one's Apple does it if Apple lives up to the hype.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.020]   Nobody will want theirs anymore.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.660]   I would so love it if Apple came out the next meeting and said we punk you all.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.020]   Watch is stupid.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:03.420]   I, you know, I know everybody's going crazy about this is for sure true.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.780]   All of our, you know, smart Apple people like Renee Richie to I'm more say, Oh no, it's
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.780]   definitely true.
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.940]   They've hired Jay Blonick.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.700]   They've done all these things.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.380]   But you know, we said the same thing about a TV set three years ago.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.380]   I still wait to see that.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.380]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.380]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.380]   I don't know.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:24.060]   And also the date to me, and then I get a lot of heat for saying this, but the days when
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.220]   you could count on Apple to come up with something that was going to change the world
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.020]   are gone.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.820]   They're just another company.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.260]   Yeah, you know, if they ever were, but I think with under Steve, they, they managed
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.700]   to do it a few times.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.100]   And iPod and iPhone and iPad, those change the world.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.500]   I mean, I just don't think that the iPod or the iPhone moment comes up that I doesn't
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.500]   come up every year.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.300]   It doesn't even come up every other year.
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.900]   I mean, I think that those things take a long, take a long time.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:57.700]   I feel like with any, every sort of new category of, of, of device, whether it's glasses or,
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.140]   or watch, it feels like everyone's like, Oh, this is going to be the thing that everybody
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.420]   has that changes the world.
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.500]   And these are incremental add-ons, right?
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.820]   These are, these are add-ons to this, to this.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.220]   I'm a, I'm a believer in the idea of wearable being a big thing.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.220]   Yes.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.220]   But I think we're up.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.020]   It's well, so long way off too.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:19.700]   I think, you know, if we're in the fabric of the clothing or, I don't know, I just, I don't
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.780]   know what the form factor is that makes sense at this point.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.340]   What is the thing that you watched would have to do that would convince you I need to have
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.180]   this in my life?
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.580]   Like I'll start wearing watches again if the smart watch did, I just, there, I don't
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.580]   know.
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.820]   I actually wear watches.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.100]   I wear expensive, you know, jewelry style watches.
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.100]   Sometimes not all the time.
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.500]   I wear it as jewelry.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.140]   But I wear them as jewelry.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.140]   I don't, I don't mean it.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.660]   Well, I wear them actually at the time.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.140]   You want to know what time it is?
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.140]   I actually want.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.140]   You're a professor.
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.140]   You need to be a class on time.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.140]   No, I'm the absent-minded professor.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.740]   I don't know where I am.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.140]   I work in a business where it doesn't matter when I show up.
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:03.140]   Actually, it's not true, but I've made it to be true, which is not bad.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.100]   I just don't, I don't, I like watches.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.060]   I think watches are very cool retro technology.
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.900]   I just think it's hard to imagine how you can turn this into a useful thing.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:14.900]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.660]   I mean, even during the presentation, the photographs of like, you know, good looking
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.220]   people sort of gazing down at their watch and touching the little tiny screen was just,
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:31.020]   it was like, speaking of presentation in the panoply of amazing Samsung embarrassing
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.820]   presentations, how did this one right?
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.020]   There was no, I didn't watch it.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.020]   There was no Broadway.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.020]   There was no rockets.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.700]   Yeah, there was no Broadway.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.900]   There was no excessive showmanship.
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.060]   They had a host who was very lively.
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.740]   That English guy with the white glasses, they use him.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.740]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.740]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.740]   And he was, he was pretty good.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.740]   Jason Bradbury.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.740]   He was pretty good.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.740]   He was a little high energy.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.740]   I was a little bit like, whoa, I found the pacing of the way.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.740]   Well, try with high energy, Gina.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.740]   He got a bug with that.
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.740]   You don't like us on energy people.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.740]   I'd be discriminated against.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:06.500]   Well, you know, it started out and I just worried that it was going to be another Broadway type
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.500]   of thing.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.500]   And then he, he intimated that it was going to be an interview style thing.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.060]   So I was like, oh, this is an objective journalist.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.420]   And he's going to ask the tough questions.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.420]   That wasn't all.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.420]   It was literally a rehearsed deal.
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.420]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.100]   The pacing of the event was really weird.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.780]   He's like, he's not a Samsung employee.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.340]   He works for a gadget show in the UK's on the, on the TV.
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.340]   Right?
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.340]   Right.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.340]   He's kind of one of us, right?
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.340]   I mean, he, he's not.
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.340]   Well, no, don't please.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.340]   Don't let us in that category.
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.340]   All right.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.340]   I think he's a presenter.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.540]   I don't think he's a journalist.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.260]   You look good in white glasses, Leo.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.060]   What is the new amazing thing you've done?
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:45.540]   I am so excited to be able to reveal a new wristwatch.
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.620]   Yeah, that's exactly what you were saying.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.620]   Very well done, Leo.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.980]   Like maybe I'm just used to the Apple presentations, but you know, there's a, there's a pacing to
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.780]   it and a cadence and there's a lead up right.
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.380]   So you start out with, Hey, we've got this many developers here this year.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.420]   This is how we had, we had last year, uh, tickets sold out in this amount of time.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.940]   And the past couple of years, here's the line chart that goes from, you know, the bottom
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.620]   up to the, up into the right of what's been happening.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.700]   And we've been, you know, that we found out this, but there's a lot of lead up.
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.540]   There's a little background, a lot of lead up.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.140]   And then there's like the big reveal and you're ready for it.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.140]   And it's exciting.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.820]   This, this presentation was a little bit like, Oh yeah, here's this new phone.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.260]   And it's kind of, you know, the note three and it's kind of an iteration on the other
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.260]   thing.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.260]   And you know, whatever.
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.260]   Okay.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.220]   Oh, and look, I just got a notification on my watch.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:36.100]   Like it, we just came very quickly and it just, and then they were like, okay, well, let's
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.100]   go back to the phone.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.100]   And you're like, wait, what is it?
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.620]   Notifications I can want is an emergency notification, right?
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.380]   The ability for my wife to say, damn it, call me now.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.380]   I want that.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.380]   Right.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.100]   But that functionality doesn't exist.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.100]   Right.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.100]   It could just as easily be her saying, I'm coming home for dinner.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.100]   Right.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:00.660]   So notifications have to, there has to be a new notification layer that, and this is
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.660]   the important thing.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.020]   It must be recipient control.
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.020]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.460]   Yeah, it's like, you got a really good.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.460]   Well, the only thing that he got a vision that he go ahead, Jeff.
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:19.180]   A little moment of a fun killer.
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.900]   Astology here for you, young G, that in the old old days, we had tried to call somebody
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.900]   in the phone was busy.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.020]   There was no such thing as call waiting.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.940]   And it was really an emergency that she did to give you a heart attack.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.060]   She called the operator and said, this is an emergency need to break in.
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.340]   Have you ever done that?
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.340]   The operator.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.340]   I need to interrupt this call.
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.340]   I have an emergency call for you.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.340]   Imagine the heart attack.
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.340]   Where did you get that?
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.340]   It's terrifying.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.340]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.980]   And that's how you used to do it.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.980]   Crazy.
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.300]   Call waiting is horrendous too.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.940]   I think we've gone beyond the call waiting.
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.540]   Call waiting is of the era of the answering machine on the kitchen counter.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.300]   I mean, these things are rapidly being eclipsed.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.460]   My mom has this whole rant about phones.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.820]   Whenever I talk to my mom on the cell phone, the call drops or the delay.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.820]   Horrible experience.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.220]   Horrible experience.
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.220]   And she just goes to this thing where she's like, remember the black phone.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.220]   It used to work.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.220]   It was the wall.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.220]   Oh, curly card.
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.620]   You picked it up when there was a dial tone.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.020]   It was crystal clear.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.260]   Like she goes to the phone.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.260]   Jennifer's like that.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.180]   She wanted she for she always wanted a kitchen phone with a long cord.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.420]   You never lose it.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.860]   You never it never falls under the cushions.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.860]   The power goes out.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.860]   It still works.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.860]   It's fun.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.500]   If you're talking to a boy you really like, you can wrap yourself around in it.
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.660]   So much fun.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.020]   I really do miss phone calls.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.260]   Straight out of bye bye, Burie.
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.260]   It's Anne Margaret.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.260]   I'm not hearing traffic.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.740]   You know, that you can actually hear the person.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.100]   That is something in the past that I actually do feel nostalgic.
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.260]   I actually have I have a number of phones because my main phone.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.100]   The AT&T phone is not usable in my house.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.860]   I don't have a land line.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.380]   So every and I accidentally pick it up every once in a while and people go, what?
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.380]   What?
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.500]   You're you're breaking speak into the phone.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.060]   I'm speaking into the phone.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.060]   And it's so frustrating.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.380]   And then but the T-Mobile will work in my house.
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.980]   So I just have to pick up the right phone.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.980]   It's gotten worse.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:11.980]   It's not better.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.620]   This is I thought not having a land line would simplify my life.
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.860]   It doesn't feel like it.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.060]   But this is modern times.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:26.500]   So the the notification that the CEO of Samsung got during the presentation was don't forget
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.300]   to talk about Android, which I thought was interesting.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.900]   They made a point to talk about Android and how it was 4.3, which is something that they
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.820]   really didn't talk about the last unpacked event.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:35.820]   Right?
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.220]   I mean, that was one of the things that a lot of a few journalists noted was that Android,
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.500]   they hadn't even said the word Android.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.340]   I think it was like once the whole presentation.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:48.660]   So that that was interesting because Samsung might just be cooking up their own OS and their
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.660]   own app store for this.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.460]   Let's take a little break to harken back to the days.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:20:02.900]   When teenagers, teenage girls in particular would spend all their time on the telephone.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.980]   And now you try to call a teenager?
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.540]   They will not answer.
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.940]   That's the funniest thing.
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.580]   My kids, when they were teenagers, it was all I am.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.580]   Right?
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.100]   And now it's not I am, it's text.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.100]   The only do is text.
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.620]   Let me see if I can skip ahead because I think that they end up.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:28.740]   Yeah, this is the various poses of teenagers.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.740]   She has a princess phone in her room.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.940]   That meant she was pretty fancy.
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.820]   Yeah, this is not my childhood.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.620]   Come on, Gina, this reminds me of you.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.380]   That's you right there.
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:46.660]   My parents actually got my sister, her own landline when she was a teenager in the 80s
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.380]   and was always on the phone.
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.580]   And then I inherited it and that was a big deal that I had my own landline.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.580]   I had my own number.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.580]   I love this thing.
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.580]   I love this thing.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.020]   The diversity is considered if you're Italian.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.020]   Yeah, right.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.300]   By my birdie did not exactly feature people of color.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.180]   Just people a little swarlier than you and me.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.180]   Yes.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.220]   You know, it's so amazing, Jeff.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.100]   You and I live in a world that has changed that much in our lifetime.
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.100]   Yes.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.340]   And it's changing really fast.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.580]   I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.100]   Now we have phones of color instead of people of color.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.580]   So we saw people of color.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.380]   Yeah.
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.700]   Gender neutral.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.980]   So Android 4.3 is interesting.
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.300]   They really are doing that.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.180]   Samsung is upgrading their phones because they want to support it because they want to
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.900]   support the watch.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.700]   Their new stuff all is 4.3.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.700]   And then Google says, oh, by the way, it's now 4.4.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.700]   Kit Kat.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.700]   Wait a minute, bring out your.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.900]   Finally, we can talk about that.
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.900]   So I'm hungry.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.900]   I know.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:57.900]   I know you guys.
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.900]   You both got brought candy.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.260]   I didn't bring candy.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.860]   You had a whole bunch of it in the office there.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.860]   Is there everybody eat it?
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:04.860]   Really?
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:05.860]   Jason.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:06.860]   Jason dumped all of the cow back.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.660]   Where's my Kit Kat?
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.860]   Durring all about it.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.500]   I want back sheesh.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.140]   Did Jenny, do any of you, you don't have any of the special?
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.020]   I actually marked Kit Kat bars, do you?
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.020]   No.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.580]   Oh, look, we got a little Kit Kat cats.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.940]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.540]   I'm impressed with those lasted.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.260]   Larry Page on his Google+ posted a picture of a giant Android made out of Kit Kat's.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.860]   I'm sorry, I think that was.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.860]   Was that Cinder?
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.860]   Yeah, I think that was.
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.860]   No, Larry Page got one too.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.860]   I saw his.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.220]   Okay, okay.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.980]   This was supposed to be Keyline Pie.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:38.980]   It wasn't it?
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.140]   Yeah, Keyline Pie.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.980]   So does it her she that went and made a deal with?
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:44.980]   Like Google or?
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.460]   All the way around.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.180]   Google went to her she and said actually Nestle, right?
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.460]   Oh Nestle owns it.
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.300]   It's licensed in the US by Reese's.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.940]   Yes, the US to Hershey.
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.060]   So now no money change chance.
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.060]   I mean the company.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.060]   Just a lot of chocolate.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.060]   Just a lot of chocolate.
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.300]   Well, I'm sure a lot of lawyers are.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.900]   I think that we from a journalistic point of view, I need a point of order, Mr. Journalism
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.540]   Professor.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.660]   From now on, I think we can't call it Kit Kat.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.220]   We have to call it Android 4.4.
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.980]   I'm not going to give it an add to the Hershey company, the Nestle company.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.300]   But this is the issue.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.580]   Is it City Field or what is it?
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.620]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.620]   It's delicious.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.620]   Okay.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.620]   Gina still needs if it's a prop for other shows.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.620]   Oh, no, she opened it.
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.620]   I'm good.
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.620]   All that Android happened.
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.620]   I can't open it.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:45.260]   I just if bothers me that they've done an obviously completely gratuitous promotional
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:51.100]   name, you might as well call it Android City Field Android 4.4.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.980]   I mean, you might as well say AT&T Android 4.4.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.180]   It bugs the hell out of me.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.100]   So I think there are a lot of good reasons for them to do what they did.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.580]   And this obviously this wasn't about money, right?
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.940]   They didn't get money from Hershey or Nestle to use the name.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.940]   You know what?
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.940]   They got everybody to talk about.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.940]   They didn't get cash.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:13.020]   They got they got value, including promotional value.
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.540]   They caught in kind.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.860]   It's very disingenuous to say, Oh, no money traded hands.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.060]   That's disingenuous.
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.060]   This was a business deal.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.980]   This was a biz dev 100%.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.140]   Yeah, this is this is cross promotion.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.420]   Yeah, that this is cross promotion for sure.
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.420]   But I think it's a little high.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.380]   I mean, I wonder the first thing I wondered was who paid who in this?
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.380]   I'm not funny.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.380]   I find it annoying.
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.380]   But I guess I'm getting like you, Jeff Cranky.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:39.100]   I think there are a couple of good reasons to do this though.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.940]   And actually, Salle is my own who who develops carbon for Android.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:48.860]   He made a really good point, which is that KitKat is a globally recognized brand.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.660]   That's a word that is the same no matter what language you're speaking.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.660]   Keyline, pie, and jelly bean and ice cream sandwich are not those things, right?
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.660]   Everyone has a good feeling.
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.940]   Everyone knows what KitKat is.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.380]   So I think it kind of goes in line with with Google sort of wanting to to globalize Android.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.380]   I mean, that was a big push.
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.780]   I owe this past year.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.780]   They want to go.
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.780]   You're trying hard.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.380]   Leo is not buying it.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:13.500]   And let's not forget that Nestle is tarnished by this, you know, selling formula in the third
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.500]   world.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.900]   This is not a brand name that you necessarily want to associate with.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.100]   I don't understand this.
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.700]   This seems pure greed on Google's part.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.860]   I don't find an amusing in the least.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.860]   Wow.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:30.740]   Why not call it, you know, I mean, I just it bugs the hell out of me.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.900]   You can find a global.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.460]   But it's first of all, it's just a code name.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.540]   But now it's more than a code name.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.180]   Now every time we talk about it, we advertise a candy bar.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.780]   I don't want to do that.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.180]   So did you disapprove of E.T.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.420]   trying for M&M's and enable the releases pieces when maybe they should have said belt
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.420]   jelly bean?
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.980]   I do admit that when I see a TV show where there's obvious product placement gratuitous
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.220]   product placement, it bugs me.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:59.260]   In fact, I don't usually watch music videos, but I've seen a few of late and all of a
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.900]   sudden music videos are full of product placement.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:07.820]   There's that little boom box that somebody makes beats probably is in all the videos
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.660]   they do like close up of boom box.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.660]   Okay, move on.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:16.460]   Obviously these are ads and what's happening is it's very obvious.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.020]   Advertising is not working for these companies, right?
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.660]   They need product placement.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.340]   They need ways to sneak advertising into content.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:29.620]   And to me, this is Google giving Nestle and they're not giving it away.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.740]   I promise you whatever they may be saying, a big promotional push.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.500]   And for the next year, we're going to be saying Kitcat a lot.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.820]   And what do you think is going to happen to sales of Kitcat bars?
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:40.820]   Will it affect them?
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.820]   Oh, no doubt.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:42.820]   A lot.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.820]   A little bit.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:44.820]   A lot.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.820]   Developers eat a lot of your products.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.820]   Is it a time for you to have a sip of that delicious snapple?
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:53.020]   I'm not against advertising.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.180]   We're ad supported.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.860]   I'm against self advertising.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.460]   I'm against sneaky advertising.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.460]   I'm against.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.220]   We didn't get any money for this.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:04.380]   It's just good, clean, fun Kitcat bar.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.380]   That's not what it is.
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.620]   It's advertising.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.620]   And I think it's repulsive.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.300]   But Nestle didn't go to Google and ask for this, right?
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.300]   Google went to Nestle.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.100]   What does that matter?
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.900]   Because I went to Ford to get them to advertise in this network.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.780]   That's how advertising works.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.980]   I bet you then went to other K companies.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.980]   Yes.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.460]   Oh, because they should have been Krispy Kreme.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.100]   Could have been Krispy Kreme.
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.820]   Android 4.4 Krispy Kreme.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.020]   I feel like...
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.020]   I think it'd be a good point, Leo.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.180]   And mostly because now we are going to be carrying water for this.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.940]   We will be advertising Kitcats.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.940]   No, but you're right.
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.940]   You can say Android 4.4.
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.940]   We should say 4.4.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.660]   And I plan to say 4.4.
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.780]   And as a programmer, I think you should offend Gina.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.700]   Because programmers come up with code names.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.700]   They're fun.
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.700]   They're mountain ranges.
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.140]   They're lakes.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.140]   They're whatever.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.700]   They're surf spots in California.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.700]   Whatever.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.180]   It's fun and it's great.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.940]   As soon as it's advertising, it's commercialized.
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.180]   Well, maybe.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.660]   But to me, that's not commercialized.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.700]   This is really about selling candy bars.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.060]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.860]   Even now a code name, a simple code name.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:19.860]   Yes, exactly.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.620]   I just feel like that's...
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.540]   But I think we're just going to see a lot more of it.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.540]   In fact...
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.540]   I now need...
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.540]   After all that chocolate, I need a sink of my Poland Springs.
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.540]   (laughter)
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.140]   I'm not against product placement.
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:41.380]   I don't like it in movies and TVs where there's gratuitous product placement.
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.940]   If somebody came to us with a product placement deal, we actually were hoping to sell the
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.940]   name of this studio.
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:52.140]   I have to say every time I talked about it, the Norton Ghost Studio or whatever, I just
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.140]   do both.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.140]   Okay.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.540]   This is a code name for a software product.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:01.180]   And it's got a hell of a lot more personality than Donut and Claire.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.180]   Well, it's so the Donut.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.180]   Sure, Donut does.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.180]   It clear does.
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.180]   I don't know.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.900]   Well, KitKat's a really strong brand.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.100]   I mean, it's a brand that people feel good about.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.500]   They're trying to add personality and flair.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.740]   If you compare Keyline Pie to KitKat, I'd take KitKat any day.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.740]   All right, okay.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.740]   I don't know.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.220]   No, but I want you to convince me on why I should be offended because this typically
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.820]   is a thing I'd be offended by.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.900]   But I thought to myself, this was a brilliant marketing move on Google's part.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.180]   I am not denying it's a brilliant marketing move.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.580]   It's disingenuous of Google to make a point of, oh, no money changed hands because that's
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.580]   BS.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.620]   Oh, no, but they've got a partnership page up where you can win.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.620]   I don't know.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.620]   I don't know.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.620]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.620]   Except for the KitKat.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.620]   I mean, they're not saying that they have nothing to do with Hershey.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.620]   No, Nestle.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.100]   I mean, they sort of clearly it's a partnership.
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.220]   And they're getting a lot of free as.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:48.660]   In fact, I just, I thought I read somewhere that sales of KitKat has skyrocketed already.
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.900]   No, you didn't have to read it somewhere.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.900]   You could write that story.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.300]   You would assume that story.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.300]   And I just don't want to.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.300]   I just feel like, come on.
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.140]   Do you really, do you need money that bad?
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.140]   Googles.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.140]   Really?
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.140]   What, but how is Google?
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.100]   Where's getting money in this deal?
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.100]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.940]   Please do not be naive.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:11.940]   It's number one.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.820]   You think Google's getting the cut of KitKat sales at this point?
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.740]   For all we know, Google, oh, no, they didn't give us any money, but we're going to get
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.020]   10% of every KitKat bar from now until eternity or whatever.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.620]   Of course, Google is getting something.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.820]   There's a lot of, there's a lot of kind.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:31.260]   If you have, when Google Play Store on a KitKat bar, you think they just said, oh, I'll
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.940]   tell you what, we'll do that for you.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.940]   What the hell?
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.940]   Right.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.460]   I mean, my biggest beef is that KitKat's are just not good for you.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.460]   It should have been kale.
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.460]   Yes.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.460]   Kale.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.460]   Kale.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.460]   Candy kale.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.460]   Candy kale, at least.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.420]   That wouldn't have been not nearly as fun as that.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.980]   Nobody gets what I'm saying here.
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:51.980]   And I'm completely, I mean.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.980]   No, I get it.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:53.980]   No, I get it.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.980]   I get it.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:55.980]   I think a lot of people get it.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.980]   I've heard a lot of that on Twitter yesterday when they announced it.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.260]   I heard a lot of people saying they fell creeped out.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.620]   Google's an advertising company.
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.620]   This is proof.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.620]   They've sold out.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.820]   It cheapens the Android brand.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.980]   You know, I just thought this is brilliant.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:14.140]   I had a day when so many big news stories yesterday.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.740]   The fact that everyone was talking about it worked.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.380]   That's what they got on the computer.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.380]   The marketing works.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.460]   I'm not free marketing.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.820]   And they're going to get it right now.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.020]   And they're going to get more.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.020]   Yeah.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.180]   Everybody has a opinion about KitKat's.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:27.180]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.740]   Well, nobody hates KitKat's.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.680]   And I think if you're a kid, I like other candy better.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:40.720]   I think of the example that we always use, there was a, well, basically it was grandma
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.240]   candy.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.440]   I'm not going to say the name because as soon as I say the name, you'll go, oh yeah.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.200]   But there was a candy that basically was completely known as a candy that grandmas would give
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   you.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.200]   You know, little candy dish.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.440]   You'd come over and you'd go, I don't want that.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.000]   And then MTV launched.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.560]   And MTV said they went.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.640]   They literally went to this candy company and said, we can make your candy hip.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.200]   We could take your grandma candy and make it hip.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:11.840]   And they launched with MTV and Mentos, the fresh maker, became a hip, cool brand all
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.200]   of a sudden because of the relationship.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.760]   It was a great relationship.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:22.440]   And you better believe those folks at Nestle know exactly what Mentos did with MTV.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.440]   This is the modern version of that.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.240]   KitKat 4.4.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.720]   This is on the website at kitkat.com.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:36.560]   Under its sleek interior, we've achieved maximum breakability in KitKat 4.4.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.480]   They've got a whole tech specs on KitKat 4.4.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.080]   Confectionary perfectionary.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:52.720]   Yeah, this was, you can't tell me that the Biz Dev team, hundreds of marketers, the agencies,
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.960]   there's a lot went into this.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:33:00.360]   And it's completely disingenuous for me to think Google is not getting anything for this.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.360]   Yeah, you know what, Leo?
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.360]   I'd feel a lot better about it.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.520]   This is kind of a rogue thing that a couple of people can't even praise.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.520]   That's fine.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.520]   That's fine.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.520]   That'd be fine.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.520]   We love KitKat.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.680]   No, this has been in the works for months.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.680]   There's a-
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.840]   Oh, you're changing my- you pull me over to your side, Leo.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.840]   You're killing me.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.360]   When is it Mentos?
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.000]   KitKat L, what can we do for L?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.080]   Mentos is in two iterations of Android.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.080]   Well, it will be a fight, Mentos versus M&M.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.880]   M&M is lost out on E.T.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.880]   They learned their lessons.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.880]   E.T.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.880]   E.T.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.880]   Reese's.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:38.800]   By the way, Reese's is the company that owns the license to KitKat in the United States.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.200]   So we know-
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.200]   Lison, Larry.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   Don't worry.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   Don't worry.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.200]   Don't worry.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   Lison, Larry.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.800]   Well, you could even argue that 4.4 doesn't deserve a code name.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.960]   Well, did they say, by the way, in all of this?
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.560]   Did they say what 4.4 does?
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.800]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   it was just a statue.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.680]   Well, there was the KitKat statue on the lawn of Google, right?
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.080]   And there was the guy with the phone.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.800]   Okay, let's talk about that.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.560]   But they didn't talk about features at all at 4.4.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.940]   So 95 Google, Mark Gurman, who is really good, he just knocks it out of the park time
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.880]   and time again.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:20.320]   Notice a little something in the video Google posted and has since pulled down of the KitKat
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.320]   video.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.880]   There's a guy.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.840]   You know, there's the usual Google employees taking pictures of putting the new Android
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.840]   statue out.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.760]   The woman on the right, she's using an excess phone.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.120]   That's obvious.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.120]   But wait a minute.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.640]   What's that Nexus phone on the left?
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.400]   It even looks staged.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:42.560]   The guy doesn't even look like he's taking a picture.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:50.280]   Actually, yeah, they said, okay, see, take this and hold it.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:55.120]   And don't move until the camera's off of you.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.800]   Look at him.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   So what is that?
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.960]   Is it the next Nexus, Nexus 5?
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.800]   I mean, it's a Nexus that no one's seen before, right?
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.000]   It's got a much bigger camera that are on the current Nexus.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.400]   There's a little pixelation or they, or they, they needed the end.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.400]   They did a little sun reflection.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.400]   Just as Xis.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.040]   I don't know what that is.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:21.840]   But it doesn't look like they blurred out maybe near his finger there with any other sort of
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.280]   branding or writing on it.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.600]   I think this says LG, but I don't know.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.560]   I think that's what it looks like the LG logo, doesn't it?
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.360]   I'll have to get my Nexus 4 out and look at it.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.120]   But yeah, that's a bigger camera sensor than we've seen.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.160]   So everyone said, oh, this must be the new Nexus.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   It's about to come out and then Google pulled the video, which basically just confirms suspicions
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.120]   that it was something that people shouldn't have seen.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.360]   There was a very clever manipulation itself.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.360]   Yeah, true, true.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.760]   I hate to be cynical, but that kind of feels--
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.600]   That you think that's what that's what it was.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.600]   This is still good.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:02.440]   Well, now this week they cut the price of the Nexus 400 bucks and announced they're out
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.080]   of them out of the 8 gig version.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.640]   They sold out immediately.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.080]   And then we're and they said we're not going to restock these.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.000]   So it's very obvious to anybody's paying attention.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.760]   Yeah, there must be a Nexus 5 coming.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.000]   I thought maybe the Moto X would be sufficient for that.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.200]   But I guess they have to have a Nexus.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.480]   So you know what I'm doing?
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.400]   I'm torturing myself.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.360]   You still haven't opened it?
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.120]   Hey, Jeff, I can do that too.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.760]   That is crazy on your street.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.760]   Do I do it now?
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.320]   Do I get my finger no ready or not?
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.200]   Well, so wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   What is stopping you?
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   What is stopping you?
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.000]   Like, why haven't you been so far?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Oh.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.840]   Oh, well, I would bet.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.000]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.160]   They say maybe October, yeah.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.280]   So it's a launch in time for the holiday season, right?
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.600]   It's going to be October or November or late.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.360]   I don't think the Nexus phones are for holiday buying.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.880]   I said this about the Nexus 4.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.880]   And I guess I was wrong.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.600]   I really-- I thought the Nexus 4 was-- this
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.400]   is a cheap phone for developers.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.040]   This is so that Google has a platform developers can buy inexpensively
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.320]   and test their software on.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.320]   And they know it's pure Google.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.040]   That's to me what it feels like the Nexus line is about.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.080]   But it turns out that this is where I was wrong.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.720]   Fans, geeks, love it.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.080]   It's a very good phone.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.600]   If it were LTE and if I hadn't gotten the 8G,
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.680]   it says all I could get when I was trying to rush an order
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.640]   while I was on the show.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.880]   But the geeks fell in love with the Nexus 4.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.520]   I didn't predict that.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.760]   I was not a fan of the screen.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.760]   It's a little washed out compared to other screens available.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.720]   I just thought, oh, this is kind of a--
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.880]   I had the same reaction that people are having the Moto X.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.360]   And it's kind of a mid-range phone.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.640]   Yeah, it's cheap.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.600]   But it doesn't wow me.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.920]   But I was wrong, obviously.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.200]   It's been a huge success.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.320]   Now, we don't know how many they've sold.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:48.800]   No.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:54.040]   It could be that it's a 1/1/1000 of the number of galaxies sold.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.400]   Probably is.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.800]   But people are very interested.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.360]   I know.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.560]   Maybe it's our audience.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.440]   We talk to all the people who know about it.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.160]   It's a beloved brand among power users and Google fans
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:05.960]   and Android fans.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:11.600]   So what is it, Jeff, you are looking for in an Nexus 5?
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.360]   It's the unknown.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.760]   He doesn't know, but he wants it.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.960]   He wants the future, and he wants it now.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.000]   It's kind of have a built-in bread maker.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.360]   I-- you know, here it is right in front of me.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.760]   I don't know what to do.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.520]   Shower one more.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.680]   You know, after-- and you know, I have all the phones,
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.720]   every one of them.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.720]   Yes.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.160]   But what I don't have yet is an Xperia Z1,
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.880]   which they just announced, the new Sony phone.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.760]   And I don't have the Optimus G2.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.520]   Neither of those are available as far as I know.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.280]   But I've played with the Galaxy Gear, the--
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:45.760]   I mean, the Mega, the GS4, I own, HTC One I own.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.920]   And I ended up-- oddly enough, this phone
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.600]   is oddly appealing going with the Moto X.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.720]   You know, I had a review unit which I sent back.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.360]   They offered me a freebie.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.840]   And I said, no, I don't take freebies.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.440]   And I just-- after-- you know, I was kind of pining for it.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.920]   It's just there was something--
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.000]   it is what you like about the Nexus 4 to me.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.400]   It's the pure Google experience.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.560]   With a few exceptions.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.240]   What appeals to me is that it's LTE.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.640]   It's 32 gigs.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.400]   Yeah, I got the 32, yeah.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.320]   And I drive a lot out here on the way home.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.000]   So being able to do the voice actually--
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.680]   Talk into it is great.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.600]   Not perfect.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.640]   Not perfect, by the way.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.960]   It doesn't understand everything.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.160]   You know, all speech recognition is still early.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.680]   It wakes up perfectly.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.760]   It's very good at that.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.800]   I like the thing-- and this was the thing that I thought
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.320]   was underreported that was really cool, which is this trusted
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.680]   Bluetooth authentication.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.440]   When you're in your car, you don't have to unlock it.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.640]   It just says, oh, I'm in a safe area.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.920]   You get to choose those areas.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.480]   That presumes you have a monitor and a car with Bluetooth.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.240]   You don't?
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:51.760]   Oh, no.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.440]   My car's 10 years old.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.200]   Yeah, I had a--
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.120]   I had a loader.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.160]   I was so amazed.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.960]   I was like-- like I got out of prison.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.160]   I had a loader a month ago.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.160]   And I paired my phone with it.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:02.880]   It's a car.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.080]   I couldn't believe everything I could do.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:05.440]   It is.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.760]   It's magical.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.560]   Whatever I read to the car, I'm like, wow.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.000]   This is like--
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.840]   But you don't either?
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.040]   I've got this old used Toyota.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.360]   I'm not really a car person.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:14.920]   And I drive--
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.520]   Lisa, we've got to pay these people more.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.640]   I can't believe this.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.880]   I feel terrible.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.080]   Well, hell, I'm even cheap enough not to show
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.440]   what I should open this.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.040]   Let alone a car.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.280]   Well, this isn't cheap.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.040]   By the way, this is not a cheap phone.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:28.880]   And that is one--
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.760]   That's the other thing about it.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.800]   One sticking point, it really is overpriced.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.440]   The rumor is they'll drop this 100 bucks soon.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:34.880]   And they ought to--
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:39.840]   I nicked my Nexus 4, which killed me on the glass.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.760]   I don't know how I did it, but I got nicks on the glass.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.960]   And I got some other stuff, and it wasn't charging them well.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.200]   I'm not trying to be something else.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.800]   So of course, I'm looking for justification
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.400]   to open up the phone.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.200]   And I was thinking to myself, I could just
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.040]   buy another one of these for $200.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.160]   It is broke.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:58.900]   You know what?
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.840]   I'll send you my Nexus 4 because I don't--
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.840]   No, no, it's fine now.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.200]   It's actually fine.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.680]   Oh, OK.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.160]   Leo, the fact that you keep back your review unit
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.920]   and then was pining for it-- how often does that happen?
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.920]   Very rarely.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.800]   Because there's always the next thing.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.160]   And I love the HTC One.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.920]   The HTC One is great.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.040]   But there was just-- it's funny.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.320]   This is a little-- it's small.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.240]   I like the Galaxy Note 2.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.680]   It's completely changing my feeling about a phone,
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.920]   but it's a very personal phone, and I really like it.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.960]   And things that people like--
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.920]   You don't want to look at the--
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.840]   The wrist flip.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.360]   I want to look.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.680]   How quirky does the product evaluations--
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.240]   if they get tied up, they have a vote for the whole audience?
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.040]   Am I still there?
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.520]   You're frozen a little, but that's all right.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.320]   We hear you.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.360]   Somebody in the general says, if you get a lot of the phone,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.320]   so much, why don't you marry it, Leo?
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.720]   No, it's just I know that you try every single phone.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.960]   And so that seems like quite an endorsement.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.000]   But here's what I would say.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.840]   A phone is a very-- it's the most personal of all personal
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.320]   computers, and there's no perfect phone.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.360]   Nothing is perfect.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.840]   There's nothing even close to perfect.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.480]   So you should really try--
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.680]   everybody should try as many as you can, at least go to the store
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.960]   and play with them.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.000]   Because this is what I like.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:21.500]   Yeah.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.320]   It's not necessarily what you would like.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:27.320]   I think for instance, you seem very happy with your HTC One
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.960]   Google edition.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.760]   And I think that's an excellent choice.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.120]   Yeah, it's a great phone.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:33.760]   It's a great phone.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.280]   I do love it.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.600]   But I have to tell you, Jeff, if I was sitting there at that box
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.000]   right now, just hearing what Leo just said,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.760]   I'd open that up.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.560]   I'd open that sucker up instantaneously.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.680]   All right, should I do it?
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.560]   Should I do it?
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.280]   I'm not going to say should do it.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:44.780]   No.
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.440]   I don't want to be responsible for it,
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.360]   because that doesn't yell at me later.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.680]   Should I do it?
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.280]   Let's see what is a chatter room.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.000]   You think Jeff should open this?
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:59.920]   Do it for Johnny?
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.280]   Yes, no.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.320]   Blend it.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.680]   You have 30 days.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.160]   Yes.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:04.840]   Open it, Jeff.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.680]   Open it.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.120]   Wait for it.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:06.480]   Do it.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:06.840]   Do it.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.840]   No, no.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.280]   There are few people say don't open it.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:10.960]   Send it back now.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.200]   I don't think it's a consensus.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:13.960]   Wow.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.320]   How much did you pay for it, Jeff?
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.360]   $674.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.360]   Yeah, really.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.120]   It's kind of outrageously expensive.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.520]   Especially since the Nexus 4, which is--
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.760]   the Nexus 4, which is really, in many respects,
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.880]   a similar phone, is half that.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.400]   Yes.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.800]   Yes.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.360]   The Nexus 4, though, screen isn't as good.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.880]   It's bigger and heavier and has a glass back.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.960]   I like-- there's something about the size of this.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.000]   Motorola said this.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.960]   We really paid attention to the size.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.240]   We want it to be just so.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.200]   And then you know, I have to say,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.000]   it just does fit just right in the feeling on the back.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.240]   There's something about it.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.280]   But this is me.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.880]   This is my hand.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.920]   Your hand, it may not fit.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:02.400]   I'm chatroom saying, no!
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.320]   No!
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.840]   Is it covered in LSD?
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.680]   No.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   This is a straw pole.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   We could do a straw pole.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.280]   I'd say it's going negative in the chatroom.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.600]   Somebody set up a straw pole.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.880]   We could do a straw pole.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.280]   We have a--
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.320]   Well, as I said, I was starting to say,
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.880]   before a quirky does this, well, they have--
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.600]   they have a polling mechanism.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.680]   That'd be fun to do with the chatroom.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.240]   We could do that.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.760]   Just have them.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.320]   I'll set up a straw pole real quick.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:28.160]   We have the technology thanks to Dan Durks,
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.080]   who wrote a very good little tool called a straw pole.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:36.040]   So what is the question we should ask, Jeff?
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:36.520]   What do you want?
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.520]   Jeff open the--
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:37.680]   Should--
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.560]   --the motor wax.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.680]   Jeff open and use, right?
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.080]   I mean, I think once it's open, I can't return it.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.840]   Oh, of course you can return it.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:47.440]   You can?
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.080]   Right.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:52.240]   Let's say right now.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:52.760]   OK.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.960]   Do you remember the Larry the Lobster moment on Saturday Night
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.120]   Live?
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.080]   Larry the Lobster.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.760]   It was one of the best Saturday Night Live
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.960]   skills where the audience voted live whether or not--
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:02.680]   Oh, he's killing it.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.520]   --killer at the lobster.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.320]   Don't come.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:06.920]   I'll give somebody--
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.080]   You're going to mess up-- now you're
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.560]   going to mess up the voting results.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.120]   Well, I guess we add them then.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:16.440]   Yeah, so what's it's-- you don't
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.640]   think you can return it once you open it or--
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.160]   You can-- it says--
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.160]   It says I'm open.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.400]   You can return 14 days I'm open.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:23.880]   OK.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.240]   All right, the straw poll number, everybody, is 390329.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:36.000]   So if you're watching live, go to straw poll.me/390329
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:36.680]   and cast your vote.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.280]   And the nice thing about this is we can actually watch
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:45.400]   the results in real time as they come flying in.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:50.480]   And so far, I mean, 2829, 32 votes.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.360]   I think yes is pretty strong majority here.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.200]   That's the yellow one.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.960]   Yes, and you got three no's.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.680]   You got to add up the three no's.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.720]   Wow, look at that.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.280]   But I think all you have to do is say what is the yes.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.040]   And right now it's 54%.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.640]   So it actually is kind of close.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.080]   You're right.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.040]   It is kind of close.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.720]   Chat room, get a life.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.920]   No, don't get a life.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.520]   Please, I beg of you, eat more KitKat bars.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.520]   Never see the straw poll move so fast.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.040]   This is amazing.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.400]   I love your chat room.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.600]   I think great.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.560]   Right.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.920]   And by the way, this is carefully done
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.080]   so that you can only vote once.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.040]   These are each unique.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.240]   Each of these is a unique vote.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.480]   Each is a completely unique vote.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.040]   It's been solidly yeses entire time.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.200]   Yeah, I think it's 55%.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.560]   Yeses is pretty strong.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.480]   I would say 45.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.400]   I don't even know if Jeff should get an LTE Nexus 7 as a no.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.000]   I don't know what that is.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.200]   And not in sequiters.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.880]   That's just you baiting me.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:56.320]   But if you had an LTE Nexus 7, you
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.240]   know you could use that as a phone.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:03.760]   Because you could put Skype on there or Tango or some other.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.400]   I'm eager.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.600]   You know who has it now?
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.120]   Who?
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:06.840]   Italy.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.680]   Got you.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.320]   You want to pick you one up in Venice next week?
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.440]   I'll pick one up in Venice next week.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.880]   Just for you.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.120]   Excuse me.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:18.000]   Where can I get a Nexus 7?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.920]   I want to get the one with the L.A.T.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.040]   What's the next week already?
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.560]   No, two weeks.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.760]   I fly out on the 17th.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.480]   Go find yourselves in Good Pasta.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.600]   Some good ones to know.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.600]   And don't forget about the phones when you're out on it.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.560]   This is why I had to get the Moto now.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.040]   Because I was really soul searching.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.040]   What do I want to carry with me as I
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.800]   travel six countries in three weeks?
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.760]   And this really-- even though the camera's not as good,
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.360]   as either the Galaxy S4 or the HTC One, and it's not unlocked,
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.160]   I'll probably bring an unlocked Galaxy S4 just
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.040]   so I have a SIM card phone.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:55.480]   But just the size of this and the weight and the--
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.760]   it feels friendly.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.640]   It's a friendly little phone.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.680]   So by the end of the show, we'll go back to it.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.400]   Yeah, we got 500 votes already.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.800]   Wow, 500 votes.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.880]   The power of the--
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.000]   I don't think at this point it's going to change.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.440]   But we'll--
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.360]   It's at the 57%--
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.000]   Slow it down.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.520]   I think everybody wants to vote.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.240]   All right, shall I do it now?
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.320]   OK, I'll tell you what.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.080]   No, let's keep it going.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.080]   We're going to keep the poll going.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.600]   I mentioned it a couple more times.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.000]   At the end of the show, whatever-- and we have 45 minutes
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:21.880]   left to vote.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.640]   At the end of the show, whatever you decide,
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.200]   that's what Jeff will do.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.960]   Jeff, thank you for putting your fate in the hands of the chat
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:28.880]   room you knit with.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.640]   What color did you get black or white or--
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.000]   Blue, royal, blue with silver.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.400]   You went to Moto Maker and did the whole thing.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.000]   Yeah, I did.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.640]   I got crimson red, and I even--
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.280]   I suckered.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.440]   I fell for the headphones.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.120]   The crimson red headphones imagine.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.120]   Wow.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:45.620]   Sucker.
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:46.120]   Sucker.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:46.880]   Those are actually decent headphones.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.520]   They're not bad.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.120]   They're only 30 bucks or something.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.280]   I have very strange ears.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.360]   No headphones work on me.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.560]   Fear buds don't work on me.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:55.080]   Really?
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:55.760]   Yeah, I--
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:56.800]   You have a tiny hole?
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.120]   Is that what both of you--
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.960]   No Bluetooth and tiny holes, is that it?
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.880]   They fall out of my ears.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.760]   Unless I have the clip for here, they just--
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.280]   they always seem to fall out.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.400]   It's just been walking around.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.240]   I'm always having--
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.760]   Really?
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.680]   I got the flanged ones.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.760]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.920]   These things never fall out.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.160]   They've got the flam--
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.040]   They have like little wings.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.160]   Yeah, no.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.880]   Well, these are from Edomodix, but other companies
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.000]   will make these.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.440]   And so each of these flaps goes deeper in your ear.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.560]   By the time you get it, they're your gagging.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:31.920]   Wow.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.920]   But it will never fall out.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.640]   And these are Edomode.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.000]   This is what I recommend, by the way.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:38.520]   Edomone.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.080]   ETYMOTICS.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.160]   They're expensive.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.920]   But they're audio file quality.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.600]   And I wear these on the airplane because they seal your ear.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.560]   So instead of noise canceling headphones, I don't hear any--
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.640]   I don't even hear the stewardess.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.120]   I don't hear announcements.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.000]   I don't hear--
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.480]   playing could be on fire behind me.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.400]   And I just be listening to my music.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.120]   That's impressive.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.160]   I've never been able to find.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   I've never been couples.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.000]   That's what these are great.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:02.920]   Noise canceling.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.120]   That's what these are great.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.000]   And they make them with the microphone as well,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.880]   if you want to use it for your headphones.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.680]   So that's-- yeah, this is what I will take to Europe also.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.440]   Let's take a break.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.280]   The poll continues.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:21.440]   strawpole.me/390329.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.080]   The votes are pouring in.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.200]   You control Jeff Jarvis.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.960]   He is a puppet.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.400]   You're pulling his strings right now.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.400]   I should have put something about making a music kick-ass.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:31.960]   It's like a dancing chicken chicken.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.720]   Yeah, dance.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.680]   Make him dance.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.160]   Chicken dance.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.000]   What should Jeff do?
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.280]   Open the phone or not?
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:47.160]   I showed it they brought to you by squarespace.com.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.040]   If you are making a website, you need
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.920]   to know about squarespace.com.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.400]   It is a fabulous place to go to get your first site off
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.800]   and running or to create a new site.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:03.040]   Maybe you just got a great idea for selling Android shaped
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.360]   kick-cat bars online.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.160]   But you got to have web hosting, right?
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.880]   You got to have a commerce engine, a shopping cart.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.480]   So somebody to take the credit card's merchant account.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.400]   Of course, you have to have a content management system
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.160]   software.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.720]   So you can post in all of that you
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.080]   can get from the best little darn little place
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:23.440]   in the world, squarespace.com.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:26.520]   Every squarespace site looks great, looks unique.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.320]   They're constantly improving their platform.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.560]   This is nice because you're using their web hosting,
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.440]   but they also maintain the software.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.080]   So it's always updated, always secure new features,
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.440]   new designs, better support, always coming along.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.320]   There are more than 20 new beautiful templates
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.520]   for you to start with all the style options you need.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.320]   You do not need to be the designer to use squarespace.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.080]   If you are, they have a developer platform.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.240]   Let's you use CSS and JavaScript and all that stuff.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.680]   But you don't have to do that.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.760]   You can point and click your way to your unique and beautiful
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.320]   site.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.440]   All you got to do is click that Get Started button right
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.280]   there at squarespace.com.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.160]   And the way it starts, you're going to get two weeks free
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:03.000]   with absolutely no credit card, nothing.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.360]   You just give them the name of your site and email address
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.440]   so you can change the password.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.360]   That's it.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.360]   Pick one of these templates.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.960]   You see, you might say, well, wait a minute.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:10.880]   There's just a few.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.880]   Oh, don't we see every--
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.240]   the beauty, template's just the starting point.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.560]   All of these, by the way, are mobile responsive.
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.920]   That means they will work on any size screen.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.960]   I'm going to pick Aviator here.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.880]   And by the way, you can look at other customers using Aviator,
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.760]   and you'll see what I mean.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.320]   Every site looks different.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.680]   Aviator is a gorgeous site for somebody
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:32.640]   who wants to do a photo blog or a gallery, where you really
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.000]   want the imagery to stand out.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.320]   See, it's full bleed, goes edge to edge.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.240]   Looks gorgeous here.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.360]   Let's look at this one, sir.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.560]   It's got a mustache.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.480]   I don't know what this is.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.720]   Is this a guy selling mustaches?
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.520]   I don't know.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.360]   Oh, it's a film site.
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.920]   It's this artist's love squarespace
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.960]   because they get to look the way they want to look.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.280]   Look at how the video is embedded right
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.200]   into the squarespace site.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.560]   You cannot bring a squarespace site down, by the way.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.960]   I've got to point this out.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.680]   They really have the best hosting.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.600]   And when it comes time to buy, after two weeks,
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.440]   you decide, hey, I really like this.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.760]   The pricing is amazing.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.840]   It starts at $8 a month for the full e-commerce deal.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:16.040]   When you buy a yearly plan, $24 a month, they don't take a cut.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.560]   You can have unlimited digital and physical products,
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.800]   no transaction fees, unlimited bandwidth.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.280]   You'll never get a bandwidth bill.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.920]   They'll even hook up a new domain name for you free.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.040]   Tax is automatically calculated, shipping automatically
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.440]   calculated, coupon controls, even track your inventory for you.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.880]   I've got to tell you, there's nothing better.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.600]   squarespace.com.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.080]   Try it free today.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.640]   And then if you decide to buy, one thing I'd suggest,
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.200]   use our offer code because you'll save money.
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:48.240]   20% off when you use the offer code TWIG
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.880]   and the number nine.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.240]   Twig and the number nine.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.800]   squarespace.com.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.120]   Really, this is the place you got to go.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.640]   All right, I don't think the straw poll uses squarespace,
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.000]   but we haven't brought it down yet.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.600]   676 votes total.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.600]   They're coming in.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.480]   We don't know yet.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.840]   I'm not going to call it.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.160]   It's too close to call.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:13.400]   But yes, percentage is creeping upward though.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.000]   It's all about Florida at this point.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.720]   Florida, Florida, Florida.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.320]   We're just going to wait and see what Florida does.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.320]   We're going to wait for the chads.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.320]   We're chad.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.720]   We got how Chad's hanging.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.720]   Yeah, he's hanging.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.400]   You can't miss him because he's got the red hair.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:35.680]   OK, I don't know what else to get to talk about here.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.600]   I got completely distracted by Cupid.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.640]   We can't get the trumpets.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.280]   Trumpets.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:39.760]   Trumpets.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:41.360]   Let's do it.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.640]   I don't know how to play trumpets without Chad.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.040]   I don't have that capability.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:47.960]   No, I'm sure I do.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.760]   They didn't tell me how.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.240]   So I'll tell you what, just imagine
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.640]   that you hear trumpets because it's
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:59.240]   time for the Google change role.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.840]   Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:02.880]   Terrible, terrible, terrible.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.320]   It's static.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.440]   It was pathetic.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.480]   Static.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.920]   Only a couple of things in the change log today.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.360]   Google releases and then pulls their new authenticator
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:17.920]   app upgrade to version 2.0 for iOS.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.880]   This is a new release of the authenticator app.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.360]   This is the app that lets you do two factor off, not just
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.680]   on Google, but on LastPass and now GitHub.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.680]   Users from when they updated the app,
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.600]   that it would delete connections to different services
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.400]   that they were using.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.640]   And all their data, Google says that it
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.080]   has pulled it almost immediately a few hours in
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:41.200]   and says that they are working on a fixed update.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.680]   So if you downloaded the update,
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:46.160]   don't run it until the new fix comes out.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.080]   And if you use Google Authenticator, you really should
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.280]   be backing up.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.320]   See what I do-- so authenticator will read a QR code, which
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.400]   is the easiest way to get that secret number into the
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:58.880]   authenticator.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.960]   That's what you have to do to get it set up.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.360]   So when you get a QR code, what I do is I save the image
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.680]   into LastPass.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:07.480]   So it's secure.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.480]   I mean, I'm not saving it on a piece of paper, putting it
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.320]   next to my computer.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:13.480]   I put it in LastPass, which is locked up in the secure
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.120]   notes.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.120]   So I have all my QR codes.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:16.960]   So I don't care.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.560]   And one of the other reasons you want to do this is when you
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.800]   set up another phone or another device, let's say Jeff gets
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:24.360]   his Nexus 7, he wants to put authenticator on it.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.640]   And he could take pictures of the QR codes and he set up.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.360]   If only I could use it on my Nexus 7.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.440]   If only I could.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.160]   So sorry.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.200]   It's needling it now.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.000]   I let authenticator--
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.120]   I switched phones at what point and didn't set up
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:38.920]   authenticator again.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:43.240]   And now I just say, text me a new verification code to my
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:43.760]   phone number.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.080]   And I've been meaning to just get it set up again and
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.400]   haven't.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.680]   But I do it all the time.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:52.280]   That's the first thing I do when I set up a new Android
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.040]   phone is I download authenticator and I go back to my
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.600]   LastPass and I take pictures of all the QR codes.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.080]   Because I have Google.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.560]   I have LastPasses in here.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.240]   Outlook for Microsoft is in here.
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.240]   Ever notes in here.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.520]   So that's how I authenticate.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.400]   And I don't know.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.760]   I like having it on--
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.720]   I have it on all my devices.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.720]   Same.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:12.520]   And that's the nice thing.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:15.880]   If you save that QR code or regenerate it and save it,
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.080]   you've got it forever.
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:20.400]   So you're taking a screenshot and then attaching that to a
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.080]   LastPass entry.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.280]   Is that how you're saving the QR code?
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:24.800]   Now that's smart.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:24.880]   That's really smart.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.920]   And then you can take a picture of it again.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.680]   Right.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:28.280]   Right.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:28.440]   Right.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.480]   You bring it up in LastPass.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.840]   LastPass will bring up its own as part of its LastPass
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.200]   settings.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.520]   Because LastPass uses Google authenticator also.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.560]   So Google authenticator is great.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.640]   So if Google authenticator is down, then you can't use
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.000]   LastPass?
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.040]   It's not down.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:46.360]   All the update did-- you know how this happens with
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:46.960]   programmers?
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:47.440]   Yes.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.960]   It just wiped the data.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.040]   So we're going to start over.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.280]   It was like the office space moment.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.640]   I was like, I must have messed up a zero somewhere.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.560]   I always do that.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.320]   Always do that.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.360]   We just wiped the cash.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.600]   Oh, they might have wanted that.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.080]   Oh.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:02.400]   Right.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.840]   It was some flag that wiped the cash.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.360]   But why would they want that?
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:07.440]   Well, if anybody-- well, you know what it is?
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.000]   Probably the guy who wrote it does what I do and thought, well,
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:10.440]   that's fine.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.560]   They just set it up again.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.080]   Right.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.280]   And then realize most people do not save.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.320]   I didn't even know you could.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:15.760]   Marko.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.720]   Somebody told me, oh, no, you can just save those QR codes.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:18.400]   Use it again.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.400]   It's just a secret number.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:20.880]   Right.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:21.320]   It's not a good deal.
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.280]   Yeah, no, that's really smart.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:23.120]   I'm definitely going to do that.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:23.560]   I'm going to get a--
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:24.280]   Put it in LastPass.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.240]   It's safe.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.240]   Yeah, I will do that.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.200]   Google is testing a new tablet search interface, which is
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.000]   similar to the mobile search interface that was very
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.560]   Google Now card-like.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.640]   And yeah, that just about kind of explains it.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.480]   It's sort of like the knowledge graph cards on the right side,
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:44.360]   but all the search results look like that.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.640]   And I believe that this is one of their kind of AB tests
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.200]   where they're experiments, where they're rolling out to some
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:53.400]   people and not others to see how users react to it.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:58.480]   And similarly, there's a new sign-in page for mobile devices
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.320]   on google.com.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.960]   If you go to sign-in to Google Now, it used to just be kind
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.960]   of a pretty plain just sign-in email password.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.880]   Now there's a new page that's been redesigned.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.960]   It says, one password, all of Google.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:12.880]   And kind of annoyingly, they took away the stay-signed
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.360]   in checkbox, which I don't understand.
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:18.520]   But luckily, I mean, of course, if you're on Android, you kind
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.200]   of have to sign in once to your Android account.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.360]   You won't encounter this page very, very often.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.200]   But that's it.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.640]   Pretty thin changelog this week.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.240]   It must, I think, with the holiday weekend, things
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.160]   were maybe a little slow at the plex.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.920]   And these ads are the truth.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:35.160]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.160]   Whoa.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.480]   Whoa, there we go.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:38.200]   We had the video.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.080]   We just have the audio.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.520]   Nice.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.880]   So I'll tell you something I am musting after.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:46.360]   Yes.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.000]   Is the Sony QX10 or QX100?
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:49.600]   Have you seen that?
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.160]   No.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:50.600]   What is that?
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.360]   The lens camera that attaches to your phone.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.960]   And you want that?
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.640]   You really want that?
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.920]   You're going to carry that around in your pocket?
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.040]   Well, I carry around a camera now in my previous--
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.000]   I guess it's not much, but I don't know.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.160]   What just hold on there?
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.520]   I carry around a camera and two lenses.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:07.800]   Right.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800]   So instead, you'll carry your phone--
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.800]   You just attach this to your phone.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.320]   It's either brilliant or stupid.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.280]   It's one or the other.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.800]   I grant that.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.800]   It does seem on the line.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.800]   It's not--
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.920]   It's almost a stupid line.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.920]   It is on the line.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.920]   Remember Eric Schmitt's creepy line?
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.200]   This is the stupid line.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.720]   This is the stupid line.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.080]   It could be one side is genius.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.160]   The other side is ridiculous.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.600]   It'll be pineapple pizza.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.080]   Remember that?
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:33.560]   Remember that?
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.160]   Pineapple pizza?
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.160]   I decided to carry an actual camera with me.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:38.680]   And a phone.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.600]   Well, I do too, but it's a lot.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.240]   It is a lot.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.280]   And you just click it on, and your phone is the camera.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.520]   Right.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.680]   Gee, you know what is--
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.200]   So do you.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.440]   Well, I really struggle to lose.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.800]   I've got a DSLR with a big old lens.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.120]   I don't know much about photography,
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.080]   but I do have a nice lens.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.800]   And when I want to take pictures of the baby--
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.480]   like nice pictures of the baby, like her monthly--
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.280]   I do a picture.
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.320]   We do a portrait every month.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.320]   I break out the big old heavy DSLR.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.600]   But I never take that outside the house.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.240]   I just--
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:06.760]   It's too big.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.600]   I don't have it in.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.040]   It's too big.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:08.560]   It's too heavy.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.000]   It's too big.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.680]   And I've got a camera in my pocket, right?
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.160]   So there's part of me that's like,
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.720]   I might want to try this.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.920]   I'd be interested to see what kind of pictures this makes.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.280]   But it's still a big chunky--
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.320]   I mean, if I'm going to carry this thing--
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.880]   That I'm going to carry the whole camera.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.400]   Well, there's a couple of things I'd bring up.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.960]   First of all, you're still using the crappy camera phone
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.960]   sensor.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.460]   Right.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.480]   You have an upgrade at the sensor.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.360]   I guess it's no--
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:32.860]   What do you mean?
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:34.520]   No, the sensor is in that thing.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.320]   Oh, you're right.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.440]   It has its own sensor.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.640]   Oh, yeah, this is not an add-on.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.120]   So the whole thing is a camera.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.480]   What do you need the phone for?
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.000]   Camera.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:41.760]   Oh, interesting.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.320]   So it stores the photos onto the phone.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.120]   Yeah, and this is own slot for us.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.760]   It has an X-more sensor.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.760]   It's green.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.440]   And it's a viewfinder.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.960]   And what phone do you have to use?
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.400]   It's a special phone.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.680]   Android or iOS?
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.320]   Really.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.320]   Oh, it's wireless.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.160]   Hook it on.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:58.800]   It's wireless.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.120]   And it uses--
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.320]   What's we call it?
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.320]   NFC.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:03.840]   NFC.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.880]   It actually uses Wi-Fi or NFC.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.880]   Yes.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.320]   And does the file stay on that lens thing,
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.040]   or does it go onto the phone?
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.280]   Yeah, it stays on the lens.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:11.880]   So I think--
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.120]   But it obviously goes right off.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.240]   I didn't-- OK, so I admit, I looked at this and went--
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.400]   I thought it was just a clip on that you put over your camera.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.560]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.200]   It's a camera all by itself.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:23.600]   You don't really need the phone.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.600]   You can just go like this.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.600]   You don't have to use the phone.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.560]   You can do that, yes.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.280]   Oh, OK.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.440]   That does change things a little.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.040]   It's just a funny form factor for--
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.280]   Again, the file stays on that lens thing.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.600]   Yeah, that's an SD card slot.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600]   OK.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.120]   Well, I think--
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:37.640]   Well, I think--
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.640]   So you have to transfer it.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.680]   You can move it over to your phone,
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.080]   or maybe it also goes on your phone right away.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.280]   It needs to have the storage on the lens thing,
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.480]   because if the phone doesn't have sufficient storage--
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:47.760]   You know what?
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.640]   I could see buying this.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.640]   Right.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.600]   Ah!
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.840]   So the $250 QX10 has an 18 megapixel sensor, an Xmore
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.440]   sensor in it.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   Not the best lens.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.400]   It's an F3.3.3.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.400]   It's a 3-5.9.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.040]   They don't say what the length of the lens is, which is odd.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:04.880]   It's a zoom lens.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.600]   I guess it has 10X--
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.120]   10X.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:07.640]   10X zoom.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.440]   10X optical zoom.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.080]   Not physical.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:10.880]   Right.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.600]   Oh, really?
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.520]   Oh, that's-- it looks like it's physical.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.680]   Really, it's optical?
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.120]   OK.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:15.320]   That sucks.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:15.840]   I think so.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.400]   Both.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:16.800]   I think so.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.240]   That sucks.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.840]   The lens on the other one is much better.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.000]   It's 300.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.800]   This is ice lens.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.480]   It says there.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.440]   It's 500 bucks.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.600]   QX100.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.080]   It has a 20.2 megapixel Xmore sensor,
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.600]   and F1.8, which is nice to F4.9.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.000]   Leo, what are you going to travel with in terms of cameras?
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.080]   A ridiculous amount.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.080]   OK.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.360]   My 5D, of course, my Mark II.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.480]   That's the good camera with all the lenses.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.440]   OK, that's about 150 pounds.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.840]   And then I also bring--
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.000]   I bought a smaller camera about six months ago
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.720]   and was trying it and working out with it, the Olympus OMD.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.720]   It's a nice compact micro four thirds camera.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.800]   I have a few lenses for that.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.640]   Lisa and I have matching cameras
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.640]   so we can share one set of lenses on that.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.480]   That sounds good.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.800]   And then I'm going to bring a little--
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.880]   I bought-- Olympus makes a little waterproof,
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.280]   shockproof, point and shoot.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.840]   And I'll have that for sand and surf and sun.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.880]   Wow.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.520]   And two phones.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.960]   And two phones.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.920]   Two phones.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.440]   OK.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.480]   I'll bring a Macbook here.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.760]   And I'll bring--
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.320]   I sort of want to come--
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.160]   I'll take a picture.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.600]   --to Italy for a day because I would just
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.240]   like to know what a day trip on vacation with Leo is like.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.600]   I can't leave it on the hotel.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.760]   I'll bring just the stuff.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.440]   You know, I booked-- there's a website called toursbylocals.com
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.560]   that you can meet somebody and get a tour from them.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.440]   And the woman we booked a tour in Venice
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.920]   is a wedding professional photographer in Venice.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.440]   She's finished, but she speaks Italian and English.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.160]   She's lived in Venice for 20 years.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.440]   And she's going to take us around for four hours
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.280]   on a photo walk.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:53.800]   Oh, that's great.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.640]   If you being you, you could have done that with the chat room,
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.600]   probably.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.680]   You know, I didn't even think of it.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.520]   You know, I should--
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.560]   anybody who lives in Venice come say hi.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.320]   We'll be at the Hotel Luna Bayonnie.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.080]   And so that'll be for three days.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.280]   Oh, nobody comes to see me.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.640]   Anyway, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.280]   But I did want to-- so each camera has a purpose.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.240]   And I am going to use my camera phone probably more
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.560]   than any of them.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.560]   Right, because it'll be--
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.640]   Because it's in my pocket.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.400]   It's always here.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.440]   The one at the dinner or whatever.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.440]   And I go.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.200]   That is one issue with the Moto X.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.560]   What I've seen are the pictures.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.560]   They're not-- it's greenish.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.240]   Not terrible.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.600]   Mediocre, though.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.000]   Yes, Mediocre.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.600]   If there's good light, it's not bad.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.680]   But there has to be a lot of light.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.480]   It also does a lot of lens flaring.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.040]   So you have to really protect it against the bright.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.240]   Gina, you didn't like the little clip thing that I bought
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.120]   it on Kickstarter, about two of them.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.440]   The thing you mentioned, I had an old one Android last night.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.280]   What are the blinders?
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.640]   You put it in the audio jack.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.320]   In the stereo?
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.880]   No, you bought that, huh?
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.640]   I bought it.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.640]   Then it becomes another button.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:00.440]   So you could use that.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.200]   Oh, the other button.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:01.440]   It's a button.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.280]   Straight picture.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.280]   Mm-hmm.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.280]   Oh, OK.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:05.720]   So, right.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.360]   So you programmed it to be a shutter.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.440]   So you just pick up the phone.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.440]   I think I will.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.200]   Click that button.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.720]   Well, but the Moto X seat-- no, you don't do that.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.800]   Because the Moto X--
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.560]   Moto X is different.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.720]   You tap the screen.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:19.920]   And you can set it to tap to focus and shoot or to just shoot
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.400]   and use the built-in focus.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.720]   I think the camera's adequate.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:26.640]   I don't think-- I know it's not as good as the Galaxy S4,
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.360]   the HTC One.
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.240]   Both of those are better.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.200]   But it's adequate.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.280]   And remember, it's just a camera phone, right?
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.720]   That's why I thought-- that's why I didn't want these.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.720]   I thought, oh, I'm not going to use my camera phone to take
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.760]   the-- but that's different.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.760]   These are cameras.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.760]   These are cameras.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.440]   Kind of an interesting product.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:43.960]   It is, yeah.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.920]   It's really interesting.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.000]   If you start to think about how you can use the phone
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.080]   as a computer and display--
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:48.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.400]   --to other devices and things.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:57.040]   Ultimately, that's why the 1020 and these other phones
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.040]   with really good cameras are very interesting,
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.080]   because you have this powerful computational platform
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.760]   behind a camera.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.920]   And then behind that, you have internet access.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.000]   And you combine those together.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.120]   That's a pretty cool thing.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:13.520]   Well, are you talking about the new Samsung with Android?
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.640]   Well, there's enough-- no, no.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.320]   I mean, I was talking about the Lumion 1020, the Windows
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.080]   phone.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.440]   Oh, I just have 41 megapixel.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.080]   That's a camera phone.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.040]   Samsung--
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.040]   I know they make a--
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.240]   --with hybrid, weird camera.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.600]   Well, no, they've got a new one.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.440]   They just announced.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:28.960]   OK.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.720]   It's just $1,700 with lens.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.600]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.480]   So it uses all the Samsung lens as well as stuff.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.560]   And it's very high quality.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.800]   And but it's full Android in the back.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.760]   4 to 2.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.080]   And so you get all the benefits of that.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.240]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.720]   Hmm.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.240]   Mm.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.040]   Leo looks like he's eating a 4.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.040]   I mean, Android 4.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.040]   I mean, Android 4.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.640]   Why the world we live in?
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.680]   There's too many gadgets, too little time.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.520]   Amen, brother.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.040]   Amen.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.000]   You know, I find it odd.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.240]   I find it interesting that here we are on the show.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.920]   We go off all kinds of things.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.000]   Not even the-- I put it in the rundown.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.120]   It's just a question mark.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.400]   Oh, Steve Balmer.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.400]   Microsoft.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.160]   Balmer, Nokia, Microsoft.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   What?
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.480]   Who cares?
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.160]   No, I was going to--
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.240]   Actually, that was the next story.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.360]   I was going to bring that up.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.160]   Oh, OK.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.480]   It looks pretty clear at this point,
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.560]   reading between the lines.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.840]   That Nokia was either--
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:36.760]   their contract with Microsoft to do Windows phones
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.200]   runs out next year.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.880]   They were either going to move to Android, which
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.280]   would have been the smart thing to do.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.720]   Or literally go out of business.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.240]   It's that bad.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.320]   So it seems likely that this was--
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.320]   that was point one was--
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.480]   this is the only company making decent Windows phones.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:57.200]   We've got to keep them making Windows phones.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.800]   Point two is they have a CEO, who's a former Microsofty, who
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.400]   is easily the front runner anyway.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.360]   And I think the people at Microsoft, the board, probably
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:08.200]   thought this is kind of like Apple acquiring next and getting
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.320]   a CEO to boot.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:13.120]   And then the third point, which really convinced me--
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.760]   I think Bloomberg noted this--
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.960]   is that this is overseas money.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:22.000]   So Microsoft, like many companies, Google especially,
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.560]   has a lot of cash outside the US.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.800]   If they bring it back to the US, they pay tax-- US taxes on it.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.560]   So it's money that's sitting overseas.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.200]   They cannot bring back.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.520]   They can't use it for shareholder buyouts.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.040]   They can't use it for dividends.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.960]   They have to-- it's just sitting out there.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.200]   So they had a couple of $7 billion, $8 billion just
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.560]   lying around.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.320]   They can't really do much with it.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.680]   They can't repatriate it.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:51.920]   I'm sorry, somebody's walking on the roof.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.920]   If somebody suddenly appears in the show, it's up a dust.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:00.920]   So you put those three together.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.960]   This makes a lot of sense.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.640]   I don't think it's going to save Windows phone.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.600]   What is Google Pay for Motorola, do you remember?
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.400]   It's a lot more.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.400]   12?
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.200]   12?
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:11.880]   12, 13?
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.600]   12 and 1/2, I think.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.720]   Now, this was a good deal, because only $5 billion,
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.880]   something like that, was for Nokia, $2 and 1/2 billion
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.920]   for the patents.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.480]   So this wasn't even a very expensive acquisition.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.480]   That would even sell--
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.480]   The point--
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.640]   It's a headache.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.560]   I think it's not going to save Windows phone.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.120]   I mean, that's the real point of all this is it's not
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.360]   going to save Windows phone.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.360]   Nothing can save Windows phone.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.440]   I still like the two people who sort of wound up
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:39.520]   without a date to their prom.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.800]   I'm just trying to get them together.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.320]   Right?
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.400]   Because I grew up--
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.160]   I warm and fuzzy feelings about both companies.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.800]   Like, first smartphone I had was a Nokia K- Anybar.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.840]   I was geo-attending photos and uploading the Flickr.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.480]   It was my first experience with that type of thing.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:57.200]   So Nokia makes great phones, or did at a time.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.400]   And I grew up, honestly, using Windows.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.600]   I want them.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.000]   And I genuinely sincerely want there
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.280]   to be another great leading operating system.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.680]   The two choices to me, from my perspective,
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.520]   seem like iOS and Android.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.080]   I would love for there to be a third.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.800]   And it's not quite there yet.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.600]   This was my first really good camera
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.000]   phone, the Nokia N93.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.080]   And it was expensive--
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.000]   Yeah, and it was like you turn it this way,
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.840]   and it was really a camcorder.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.200]   Wow, look at that.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:28.600]   That is fancy.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.320]   Talking about the stupid line.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.240]   Well, I was really happy to get this.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.680]   And this was back, I don't know, 2005, 2006.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.800]   It was before the iPhone.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.760]   And look, it even had a mirror on this side
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.280]   so that you could do selfie videos.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.640]   Wow, that's kind of its time right there.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.120]   Oh, no, people have been taking selfies
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.040]   for as long as they've been cameras.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.240]   Nothing innovative about the selfie.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.880]   Yeah, we just see a lot more of them.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.680]   We just see a lot more of them.
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.920]   So yeah, I have a very--
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.640]   Would Blackberry have been-- just to play with it.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.880]   Blackberry has huge business audience.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.480]   If you could fix Blackberry, no.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.360]   No, no, because here's the point.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.520]   Samsung makes Windows Phone, but they do it
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.240]   by rebaking half-year-old Android devices.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.640]   HTC, same thing.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.840]   Nobody's making a good Windows Phone, except Nokia.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.840]   Nokia's making great Windows phones for the--
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.360]   Yeah, they have to.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.280]   Phone's so good.
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.600]   Well, yeah, I mean, phone's so good that they make me actually
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.600]   consider buying a Windows Phone, which is saying a lot.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.840]   So I think this was a smart move in the sense
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.280]   that if you're devoted to the platform,
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:46.080]   it had Nokia, a band in Windows Phone, the platform's dead.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.880]   My co-founder, Anil, floated an interesting idea,
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.080]   which is that with this acquisition,
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.880]   Microsoft now has rights to Google Motorola's patents
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:01.720]   at Nokia's license rates, which protects them to some degree.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.280]   He was like, if I was a bomber, that's
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.200]   how I'd pitch it to the board.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.840]   I bet you there is definitely patent stuff in there, sure.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.740]   There's other-- it's much like the Google
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.600]   Rola deal, I think.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.400]   Yep.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.400]   Although Google got a company that-- that's why it's still--
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.240]   I guess Google-- see, one of the things Google is doing,
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.320]   I think quite well, is building a firewall between Motorola
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.280]   and Google to reassure OEMs.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.840]   At this point, anybody who makes Windows Phone that's not
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.280]   Nokia is going, see you.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.960]   In fact, it's probably the case that anybody who makes a surface
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:40.040]   or other Windows RT device that's not Nokia is going.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.320]   Thank god.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.440]   We can get out of that business.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.920]   So it's--
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.120]   You didn't have to change the conditions, it'll break contracts?
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.000]   It's a risky move.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:49.840]   Yeah, of course.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.760]   It's a risky, risky move, I think.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.760]   But Microsoft's in deep do-do.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.160]   I don't think anybody thinks otherwise.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.840]   Yeah, no, that's probably the best.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.040]   Probably the biggest tech story of the--
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040]   Yeah, it is.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.040]   But Android is so dominant at this point
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:13.200]   that we don't even have to pay attention to those stories.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.440]   Any other Google-- exciting Google news,
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.160]   or want to talk about--
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.440]   Hugo Barra.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.400]   We didn't mention Hugo Barra.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.600]   That's a big deal.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.440]   So OK, now I watched you talk about this
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.320]   and all about Android.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:29.080]   And you guys were really generous and kind.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.240]   I have a feeling you think that about a lot of them.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.720]   [CHEERING]
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.960]   I thought-- no, I thought you took the high road
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.200]   and I was very impressed because I would have brought up
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.040]   the whole girlfriend--
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.000]   Ah.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.920]   --gauker story there.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.120]   Do you think that has anything to do with it?
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:48.000]   I think people in offices have all sorts of relationships
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.120]   all the time, and I don't think it had anything to do with it.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.600]   I mean, I don't think it had anything to do with it.
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.280]   No, you're right.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.040]   And you and Jason and everybody said, Ron said,
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.920]   is this is what happens in a company successful, the people
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.120]   who have built the success, move on, Hugo Barra,
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.000]   a big part of the success of Android.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.680]   He was the face of Nexus.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.480]   You think this is like a jilted lover thing?
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.680]   OK, so this is soap opera Leo, OK?
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.200]   No evidence for this.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.520]   So I'll tell you the story as I see it.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.040]   And I have to say, this comes from my upbringing
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.440]   because my mom would look at somebody.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.560]   She'd look-- mostly we'd be like in the kitchen.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.160]   She'd look out the window in the neighborhood.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.560]   She said, let me tell you about that guy.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.000]   And would spin an entire story about the family.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:29.440]   OK.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.640]   Yeah, she's like Mrs. Kravitz.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.200]   Oh my god, he's a drunk.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:33.720]   He's in there.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:34.520]   He's in his underwear.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.040]   It's 4 in the afternoon.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.040]   He's watching TV.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.200]   He beats his wife all this from like one glimpse.
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:46.000]   So anyway, I am channeling my mom now.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.840]   Larry Page is married to the very talented--
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.840]   how do you pronounce her last name?
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.440]   And what, Jickie?
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:52.920]   We'll just--
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:53.440]   We'll just--
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.760]   Sickie, whatever.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.000]   Has been for some time.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.600]   They're a cute couple, engineer couple.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.080]   She's a CEO at 23 and me.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.280]   He supports her efforts.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.240]   They have a charitable foundation together.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:08.080]   She has a lot of Google stock.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.440]   Non-voting.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.040]   I mean, Sergey-- did I say Larry?
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:11.720]   Sergey.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.840]   Sergey Brin.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:16.200]   Sergey was quick to point out on Twitter or somewhere.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:16.640]   Don't worry.
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.240]   She's not voting the stock.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.200]   So suddenly, they're separated.
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.760]   We just find this out, but apparently it's
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.360]   gone on for a while.
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.520]   Then, we shortly after that find out, oh, Sergey
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.560]   has a new girlfriend.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:32.440]   He's going out with somebody else at Google.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:37.080]   Oh, it's Hugo Barra's ex-girlfriend.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.920]   So this-- OK, I'm telling you complete fabrication.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.000]   Those are facts.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.480]   Complete fabrication now.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.400]   But I just can see this scene.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.080]   If we're writing for the Sopranos,
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.040]   I'd write this whole thing out.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:53.920]   Hugo storms in and he says, are you sleeping with my girlfriend?
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.160]   What happened?
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.040]   Sergey says, ah, you got me.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.320]   Boom, bam, zoom.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.240]   I am out of here.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.720]   I'm going to China.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.240]   I don't know.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.080]   I just-- that's what I see.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:07.640]   Sergey Brin's at home and is in underwear.
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.200]   It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.200]   He's watching TV.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.840]   He's a little bit tipsy.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.240]   I'm just saying.
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:13.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.240]   I'm sure that happens a lot.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.240]   Sergey.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.080]   I mean, so Sergey--
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:23.560]   Nobody's business, but there's-- it's stupid.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.960]   The only reason there's any news at all there
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.080]   is, of course, the amount of jointly held Google
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.880]   stock by Anand Sergey.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.680]   Yeah, I mean, Sergey being separated
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.720]   and dating someone at Google actually is news,
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.960]   for that reason, because--
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.680]   It's material in terms of finance.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.600]   There was a prenup.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.840]   And I think that that's all protected.
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:42.360]   I don't know.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.520]   Listen, it's hard for me to believe they
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.520]   weren't completely different departments at that.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.760]   Yeah, but he's stupid.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.520]   His girlfriend.
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.360]   And he says, that's it.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:48.920]   Screw you.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.840]   I'm going to China.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:51.280]   Yeah, but--
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.080]   He might as well have bought a boat on a ticket.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.800]   A ticket on a boat.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.840]   But there's also--
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.680]   my sister is also VP of development.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:17:59.960]   I mean--
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:00.480]   I know.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.320]   It's a mess.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.320]   Oh, thank God.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:02.840]   It's all kind of a mess.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.640]   It's a mess.
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:07.040]   Yeah, Anne Wojcicki's sister runs advertising.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.640]   And did you know why?
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.600]   Because she gave him the garage.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.120]   She's getting it, right?
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.040]   She leased them the garage when they first started
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.600]   Larry and Sergey.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.640]   And now somehow she's running Google advertising,
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.480]   so that was a good deal on her part.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:25.560]   And her sister was married to Sergey.
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.440]   So obviously they met--
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:27.360]   A brilliant family.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.840]   Their mother is a journalism teacher at Palo Alto, huh?
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:31.360]   OK.
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.160]   So she is feeling guilty now.
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.680]   I'm feeling very guilty.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:36.000]   OK.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.480]   Mrs. Wojcicki, I'm sorry I said anything.
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:44.160]   I'm sure this all happened in non-sequential order.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.520]   It's a small company.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.240]   It's easy.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.680]   People fall in love just because it was Hugo's girlfriend.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.200]   Even among geeks.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:51.920]   Life happens.
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:52.320]   I feel like--
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:52.880]   Life happens.
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:53.520]   --going among geeks.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.040]   It's hard for me to believe that Bara is--
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.400]   I mean, he strikes me as someone who has gotten so far.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.280]   And he was so ambitious and so smart
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.040]   and is committed enough to Android that he wants to be.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.360]   I mean, China's an interesting-- it was a really fascinating
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:05.760]   market.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.320]   Maybe Xiaomi offered him, hey, we'll
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.960]   write you a check for $10 million.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.800]   But you've got to think that Hugo's got a lot of money
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.720]   and a lot of Google stuff.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.280]   Yeah, you imagine he already has a lot of money.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.080]   Yep.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.920]   Maybe the opportunity to be VP at a Chinese phone company.
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.360]   That was--
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.520]   it's not compelling to me.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.360]   But it is kind of cool to see a Google insider take over
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.200]   a manufacturer in a new market.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.640]   I mean, because now you have someone who's played both sides.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.680]   Oh, it's good for Google.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.920]   That's how they spin it.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:35.880]   Yeah, that's how they spin it.
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.160]   Like, hey, we're so glad that he's staying within the Android
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:38.840]   ecosystem.
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.200]   Is there a soap opera going on about Android?
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:44.560]   Andy Rubin leaves, JBQ leaves.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.680]   That's a more relevant question.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.840]   Hugo Rubin leaves.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.680]   Yeah, there seems a little bit about people going on.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.200]   A lot of people--
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.000]   So no, here comes in.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.160]   --people actually.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:52.660]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:54.200]   We don't know who's sleeping with whom.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:58.520]   I don't know.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:59.720]   Someone you're changing the world, yeah.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.120]   --tipped cat bars or a stick cat with gakari.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.100]   It's totally low of me to even mention this.
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.280]   It's very sleazy and gakari.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.520]   We expect nothing better.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.800]   I'm just being honest.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:15.080]   I understand that this is totally fabricated.
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.440]   I love that the gakari is the synonym for sleazy.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.400]   It's so gakari.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:19.900]   It is.
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.160]   It's so gakari.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.260]   And I'm--
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:24.700]   Or gakari did it.
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.860]   Part of this-- you have to feel for her as well.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.660]   She's obviously a smart and talented person,
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:30.140]   otherwise you wouldn't be at Google.
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:32.580]   And now this is what's--
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:34.460]   and it's a woman in technology.
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:35.660]   It's always ugly.
[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:37.300]   It's always ugly.
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.020]   And I've been on the other side of these stories.
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.060]   And I-- you know, it's sad.
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:43.260]   And I shouldn't even bring it up.
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.340]   But we're humans.
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:46.860]   There's a part of us that kind of wants to know,
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.940]   what's the gossip?
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:50.540]   What really happened?
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.040]   True.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:54.440]   So ABC has, to my mind, the winning headline,
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.840]   men apparently do make passes at girls who were there.
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.600]   Is that Rupert Murdoch?
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.600]   Wow.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.200]   And Rosenberg and the Rosenberg was
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.320]   the person who came up with the OK Glass phrase
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.160]   to activate glass.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:09.660]   Really?
[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:10.400]   She works on glass.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:11.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.320]   So you're spinning on last night and all about Android was.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.200]   And I think this is actually much more reasonable
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:16.720]   than what I said.
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.320]   This is just success.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.900]   Anytime something successful, people get opportunities.
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:22.400]   Oh, you did OK Glass?
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:25.740]   Can I throw millions of dollars at you to come to my company?
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:26.540]   Oh, no, no.
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:27.580]   This is not Hugo.
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:30.700]   This was his ex-girlfriend, who was the one who came up
[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.280]   with the OK Glass.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.180]   Really?
[01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:34.140]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:34.780]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:34.940]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:37.660]   So she and Sergey both work on in Google X, right?
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.580]   Which is the lab that does the lunes and glass--
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:41.900]   You know, you're doing things.
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.660]   You're doing moonshots.
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:44.460]   It's late at night.
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:46.260]   You've done a couple of moonshots.
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:49.320]   It's a little romantic.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.240]   The music's playing.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.240]   Elon Musk is calling you.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.840]   You're kind of--
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:58.880]   You're coming up with catch raises of the future.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.600]   I mean, come on.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:02.080]   This is actually-- it's kind of sad,
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.600]   because there are kids involved.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.040]   And these things are horrible.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.480]   It's always-- it's horrible.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.240]   And it's not worthy of anything that I should even
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.080]   mention.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.400]   And I'm deeply ashamed of myself for bringing it.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:15.120]   I just hope that Google can find someone who is just
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.900]   sort of personal and does good demos the way that you go.
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:18.900]   Who does the best?
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:19.820]   Who does the best?
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:21.700]   Vic's pretty good.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:22.460]   Vic's pretty good.
[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.180]   Sundar, not so good.
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:25.580]   He's OK.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.620]   Yeah, he's OK.
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:28.260]   Andy, you were going to--
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:29.060]   He was very good.
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:30.180]   Never did demos.
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:31.460]   Never did demos.
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.620]   Hugo was the face, because he wore those black T-shirts,
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.060]   and he had the nice biceps.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:36.540]   Yeah, he had arms.
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.900]   And he had the arms.
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:39.900]   And he had the arm with the Nexus 7.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.980]   And then he was--
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.380]   He was handsome and romantic.
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:45.840]   And I think that that worked pretty well.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.380]   Yeah.
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.060]   He was only slightly foreign.
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:49.560]   He had a slight foreign accent.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.160]   That slight foreign thing, you know.
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.460]   He was just a little bit exotic.
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:54.600]   He was a little bit exotic.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:57.880]   Works for Americans, you know.
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.320]   All right, let's check the--
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:00.840]   let's check the straw poll.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.360]   Uh-oh.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.840]   Uh-oh.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.440]   Chat room.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.600]   I feel terrible.
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:06.600]   I shouldn't have brought that up.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.040]   And I apologize for bringing it up.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.600]   No, don't worry about it.
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.080]   You know, I--
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.320]   I just have that kind of imagination.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.520]   And I blame my mom.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:13.020]   And I mentioned it.
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:14.540]   And I thought, oh, maybe we should have--
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:15.640]   and then I was like, no.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.580]   No, you were right not to.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:17.700]   I was watching all about Android.
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:18.740]   Just wondering if you would.
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:19.180]   And you did.
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:21.100]   You guys took the high road.
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:22.380]   Very proud of you.
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:25.740]   So I decided to drag us through the day.
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.820]   Somebody's got to do it.
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:30.460]   Our straw poll continues.
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:36.700]   The vote is on straw poll.me/390329.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.180]   By the end of the show, we will decide
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.100]   if Jeff Jarvis is going to open--
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:41.500]   He'll lower the lobster.
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:45.700]   He's going to kill Larry the lobster and open his Moto X.
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.480]   And I got to tell you, it's only getting stronger.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.880]   59% yes right now.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.160]   That yellow wedge is growing.
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.000]   It's going to look like a Pac-Man any minute now.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.880]   Unboxing, unboxing, unboxing.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:04.440]   This is like-- well, this is the horribly boring geeky version.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:08.380]   Howard Stern showed Lisa G. would kiss Ronnie the limo driver
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:10.420]   if a certain number of votes came in.
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:14.300]   And what did Howard have to say about the Google thing?
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.460]   He didn't talk about it at all.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:16.460]   He's off.
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:17.460]   He's doing a--
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:18.340]   He's doing a certain VC show.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:19.260]   He couldn't care less.
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:21.860]   He couldn't care less now.
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:24.660]   Google Glass will have an app store coming next year.
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.220]   So it sounds like Glass is moving more towards product.
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:30.300]   Like it'll be an actual product we could buy maybe next year.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:31.420]   Right?
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:33.940]   I spent the last week at the US Open.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:37.500]   I was going to take it and I thought, why?
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:38.220]   You didn't do--
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:42.860]   I saw your great Auto-Awesomes, including the Victory
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:44.380]   shuffle or whatever it was.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:45.380]   But that wasn't with Glass.
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:46.580]   That was just with your phone.
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:48.340]   No, because you only get far away.
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:49.180]   You can zoom.
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:51.460]   You wouldn't give you anything.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:54.260]   So it's not a very good camera.
[01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:57.340]   Up close, it's OK.
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:01.300]   I'm going to go to the US Open app to find the stats or the scores
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:03.940]   of that kind of stuff.
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:04.580]   Here's Andy Murray.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:06.020]   It's much effort.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:10.820]   It's hard to see, but he has a great winning grimace at the end.
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:12.700]   Are you on the court?
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:14.020]   You had great seats.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:14.940]   We had great seats.
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:15.900]   Well, here's the trick.
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.420]   It's got to seem obnoxious.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:20.020]   If you buy seats for--
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:21.380]   this is not ash.
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:22.220]   This is Armstrong's.
[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:25.540]   But this is the junior stadium.
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:28.100]   And if you buy seats, you can then sell them through Ticketmaster.
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.220]   So my wife was doing great.
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:30.620]   She sold most of the seats back.
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.740]   We earned money.
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:35.340]   So there's Andrew Murray serving.
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.340]   Now, people are yelling at me for using all of us.
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:37.900]   Those are camera phones.
[01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.540]   Those were not glass photos, Jeff, right?
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:40.740]   No, those were neither.
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.620]   That was my Nikon one.
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:44.180]   And you uploaded it.
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:44.860]   And I uploaded it.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.100]   And then I'll also do this.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:50.220]   And the point of that post is that I went--
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:52.780]   when Janine Gibson, who's the editor of Guardian US,
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.740]   and one of my colleagues here at CUNY and John Spock,
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:57.660]   each talked about using dancing gifts for news,
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:59.100]   I screamed at them.
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:25:59.860]   I know.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:00.860]   I know.
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:01.380]   I know.
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:02.860]   Oh my god.
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:03.860]   How could you do that?
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:06.140]   And then I had to admit I'm wrong,
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:09.260]   why not have, like a Harry Potter newspaper or the prophet,
[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:11.020]   have the photo that moves?
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:14.620]   Because you can see the reveal of Andy Murray coming up
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:17.580]   as he's going, yes!
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:21.020]   And that would be something in the motion.
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:22.860]   And why not use a video player?
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:24.060]   Because he got to launch the player.
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:24.060]   Right.
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:25.060]   He got to go on the gillow.
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:25.860]   Not so bad.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:26.980]   It's a light version.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:29.740]   So it's the idea that a photo can move.
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:30.980]   Why not?
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.220]   What makes it holy that it shouldn't move?
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:34.260]   Some people are yelling at me, something,
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:36.460]   I'm going to unfollow you because you think you can move at fine.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:36.980]   Hi.
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:37.180]   Goodbye.
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.740]   I've got 200 million followers at Google+.
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.300]   Goodbye!
[01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:42.740]   But is there an argument that a moving gift would
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:45.420]   draw the eye away from the text of the story,
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:47.740]   like in a new story?
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:48.940]   It was an argument that you were--
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:50.580]   Like visually distracting.
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.500]   It's just irritating.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:52.780]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:54.100]   Well, I mean, you can't do it in print,
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:56.660]   so it mustn't be right.
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:57.660]   Right.
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:59.580]   With the New York Times have done that.
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:01.100]   No.
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:02.180]   But Jeff, so you--
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.060]   We're going to be just open.
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:05.540]   You decided not to bring glass because you felt like you
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:06.740]   wouldn't get value out of glass.
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:08.260]   You're not going to get great pictures.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:09.540]   You're already kind of in the crowd.
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:13.100]   You know you're not going to get the updated scores.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.020]   No, right.
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.900]   So what was going to get out of it?
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:18.340]   And the worst part of it, Gina, this is a moment you will
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:20.100]   have come soon.
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:21.540]   What have humiliated my daughter?
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:27.020]   Like in three minutes, she's going to have that one.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:27.540]   Oh.
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:28.180]   Oh.
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.220]   My wife, too.
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:30.020]   They start writing.
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:33.660]   They start kindergarten being humiliated.
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:36.460]   But I can imagine a future where glass
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:41.780]   knows you're at the open and installs the app or you can say,
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:44.060]   hey, if I'm in a ball game or whatever, hey, just play me
[01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:47.740]   the live the radio broadcast into my bone conducting.
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:50.300]   When it's smarter, it's a more consumer.
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:51.300]   What?
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:52.940]   No, you guys are such nice.
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:55.580]   I thought, ah, I should have brought the radio.
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:58.100]   Because I like to listen to you while you watch the game.
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.380]   Well, yeah, at the open, the American Express gives away,
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:02.420]   if you have a card, these little radios,
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:03.580]   who you get American Express radio,
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:04.700]   you just listen to it the whole time.
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.980]   So you hear back and row call on the game you're watching,
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.700]   which is great.
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:10.460]   They also, very recently, they also gave out
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:16.660]   time-war cable this time for free loan-lint fan visions.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:17.740]   What's the fan you watch?
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:18.260]   What are fans?
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:19.780]   The other courts.
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:20.340]   Oh.
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:22.900]   TV, you carry around for your neck.
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:28.060]   And you had like seven views around the tennis stadium.
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:30.660]   And you had three arms, three out of ash, one out of armstrong,
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:32.180]   one out of the grandstand, one out of the 17,
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.580]   where you can watch these various things.
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:36.420]   There's a lot of money in tennis.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:37.700]   Yeah.
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.820]   Well, and I don't know what a baseball game is very often,
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:41.100]   but I happen to know this Padres game.
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:43.700]   They don't show you replays in the stadium.
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.740]   No, because they're afraid you'll throw batteries at them.
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:46.260]   Right.
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.180]   I was like, what?
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:48.940]   I was asking my-- she was like, oh, they don't want any people
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:49.460]   to riot.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:50.860]   I was like, what?
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:52.540]   You don't go to many games, apparently.
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:53.740]   I don't go to many games.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:55.380]   No, but it was so frustrating because there was a call
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:56.580]   that seemed clearly bad.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:57.580]   And you wanted to see it.
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:58.940]   But anyway, that's something I would love
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:00.700]   to have had on Glass.
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:03.380]   Leo, if I were you and I was taking the trip that you are,
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:04.260]   which I--
[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:05.220]   You'd work last?
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:07.300]   You'd be deeply wish that I was, by the way.
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:08.580]   And I feel like I love my daughter,
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.740]   but I feel like I'm not going to be able to--
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:11.940]   Think of taking Edda.
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:12.460]   No.
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:14.060]   In 10 years, you'll be able to take Edda,
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:15.980]   and it will be an amazing thing.
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:16.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:18.140]   Well, she's maybe out of diapers.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:20.180]   But yeah, I would bring Glass.
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:21.420]   I would bring Glass, because I do think
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:23.540]   that it offered-- in particular, being sort of out and about
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:24.140]   and seeing--
[01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:24.580]   Right.
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:26.660]   --see places or being able to look up things
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:28.620]   in those situations.
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:29.740]   It is, in a way, it's funny.
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.900]   It's so much more intrusive to pull out a camera
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:35.900]   and take a picture than it is just as go OK, Glass,
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:36.660]   and do that.
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:40.060]   So yeah, I can understand what you're saying.
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:41.980]   This is something you can do with the Moto X
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.460]   that you might be interested in.
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:48.180]   To help you, Jeff, they have one of the things that's in it
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:52.020]   is a slow motion video capability.
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:53.260]   Did you know that?
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:57.660]   So you can take-- with the camera, you can take slow.
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:58.420]   It doesn't do audio.
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:00.340]   I wish it did, because you could go--
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:02.340]   You could slow me down to a normal speed.
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:03.340]   Nooooooo.
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:09.740]   Aww.
[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:11.740]   See, wouldn't that be fun?
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:15.220]   You can just add these sound effects yourself, actually.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:17.860]   I've had people tell me that they normally listen to Twit
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:20.180]   podcasts with a speed up, except this one,
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:21.100]   because I talk too fast.
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:21.540]   Yeah.
[01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:23.060]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:25.500]   There's a few people-- Tim Stevens from a former engager editor
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.140]   now at CNET talks really, really, really, really fast.
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:29.900]   And if you sped it up, you'd be like,
[01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:31.820]   you're listening to Alvin and the Chipmunks.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:33.900]   He also must be a beast ghost, because I--
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:34.780]   You know, it's Eastern.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:35.300]   It is.
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:35.820]   It is.
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:35.820]   It is.
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:36.820]   New Yorker.
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:37.300]   Yeah.
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:39.900]   I get people all the time asking me to slow down.
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:43.180]   All right, we got to get rid of Je-- no, no, we have to let Jeena go.
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:44.780]   That's the phrase.
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:48.580]   In just a few minutes, let us get our tip and our number
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:50.980]   and our tool of the week, and then we'll check the votes
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:53.700]   and see what Jeff's going to do with his Moto X.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:56.780]   Starting with you, Jeena Trapani, and your tool of the week.
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:59.860]   Actually, quickly, Ken from Chicago in the chat room
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:02.700]   mentioned that today is the 15th anniversary of Google.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:06.180]   And looking at Wikipedia, indeed, Google
[01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:09.180]   was founded on September 4, 1998.
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:10.060]   Oh, I don't--
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:11.660]   And no doodle or anything.
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:11.900]   They should--
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:12.740]   Wow, no doodle.
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.740]   No doodle.
[01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:14.940]   That's awesome.
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:19.100]   Yeah, can you believe that the Google is only 15 years old?
[01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:20.220]   Is that crazy?
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.420]   It's only a teenager.
[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:24.940]   I mean, of course, that's ancient in internet company.
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:25.900]   It is, actually.
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:27.580]   It's surprisingly old to me.
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:28.860]   You think about it.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:33.420]   I remember the day before there was a Google.
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.420]   Out to Vishta.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:34.940]   I remember going--
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:35.920]   All for Mr.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.860]   I remember to go on to dinner with Larry and Sergey.
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:42.060]   I mean, they would invite press to go to dinner
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:44.700]   and ask him questions and talk and stuff.
[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:45.660]   Wow.
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:46.780]   That's access right there.
[01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:48.060]   All right, well, how to bring them up.
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:48.660]   Happy birthday.
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:49.460]   Happy birthday.
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:51.340]   Well, no, that's a huge deal.
[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:51.900]   15 years old.
[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:52.260]   If it goes over--
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:53.020]   If it goes over the rundown, I'm not
[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:53.940]   going to use it as a number now.
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:55.420]   If you go over the rundown, there are 15 things
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:57.900]   to know about Google and the rundown, some of which
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:59.660]   are obvious, some of which aren't.
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:00.180]   Oh.
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:01.500]   Oh, Jeff, sorry.
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:02.100]   I still get a number.
[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:02.660]   Was that your number?
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:03.660]   Was that your number?
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:05.380]   Gina, you know what the number is going to be now.
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:07.060]   It's whatever comes up in the poll.
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:08.060]   Ah.
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:08.900]   We have--
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:11.780]   We're making numbers even as we speak.
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:13.660]   I didn't know that the first Google doodle
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:16.260]   was a burning man symbol.
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:17.260]   Huh.
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:17.780]   Ah.
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:18.280]   Ah.
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:18.780]   Ah.
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:22.300]   It was acquired an average of one company every week
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.500]   since 2010.
[01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.140]   This is from the Guardian, of course.
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.980]   Jeff's favorite newspaper now.
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:28.860]   It is indeed.
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:30.060]   Full disclosure, I worked for them.
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:34.660]   I wish I had-- I could get it on my doorstep.
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:38.140]   Google was originally called Backrub?
[01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:39.060]   I don't remember that.
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:40.420]   Oh, wow.
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:43.380]   Google has acquired an average of one company every week
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:43.980]   since 2010.
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:47.860]   They were burners.
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:48.300]   Yeah.
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.500]   Larry and the Sergey were burners.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.580]   They're still burners.
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:51.020]   Aren't they?
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:51.620]   Don't they still go?
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:52.100]   Do they go?
[01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:54.020]   They probably go in a jet.
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:54.660]   Yeah, probably.
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:56.180]   Warbursts jet.
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.220]   Harroshoot Inn.
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:32:59.220]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:01.980]   1,000 Google employees became millionaires
[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:04.860]   when the company went public in 2004.
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:08.740]   One of them was the masseuse Bonnie Brown, who
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:11.700]   worked giving Backrub's for the company in 1999
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:14.180]   for $450 a week plus stock.
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:16.460]   Backrub's is a theme here.
[01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:18.020]   Yeah, maybe that's why they called it Backrub.
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:21.060]   On Facebook with public, the guy who painted a mural
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:22.940]   on Facebook's wall became a millionaire,
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:23.900]   because they couldn't pay him.
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:27.140]   They gave him stock.
[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.420]   Google hires goats.
[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:31.660]   They have 200 goats a week to eat the grass.
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:35.140]   That's a typical thing in California, actually.
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:36.940]   Google's first official tweet was the words,
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:39.740]   "I'm feeling lucky in binary."
[01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:40.380]   All those nerds.
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:41.860]   That's geeky.
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:43.300]   Nerds.
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.900]   And they probably didn't even use a calculator.
[01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:46.260]   They just knew it.
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:47.180]   They probably.
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:48.380]   They would like the Twitter game.
[01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:50.140]   That was a '09.
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:50.740]   Oh, nine.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:51.220]   Wow.
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:52.060]   Yeah, it's a '09.
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:53.620]   You're first to-- let's see this here.
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:54.260]   I'm going to see this.
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:55.900]   There's a link to it.
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:59.500]   It's from a Googler @Google.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:00.820]   I'm following that Googler.
[01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:01.460]   I didn't know that.
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:01.980]   Look at that.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:07.940]   The Exugler.
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:08.740]   The Exugler.
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:10.220]   Exugler.
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:12.100]   If you're a Googler when you first start,
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:15.660]   and a former employee like Hugo Barra is an Exugler.
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:17.900]   Exugler.
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:20.700]   And Larry and Sergey own just 16% of the company,
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:21.860]   but that's worth--
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:25.340]   here's a good number-- $46 billion.
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:27.340]   Yo.
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:28.740]   Man, it's a good number.
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:30.900]   Do you have a tool too?
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:33.100]   Yeah, quick tip, actually, this week.
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.820]   As of the latest Play Store update on Android,
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:37.820]   this is actually an Android tip.
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:41.020]   So when you get updates to your apps
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:43.100]   and you tap that update all button,
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.620]   it used to be that all your apps got updated,
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:49.340]   even the ones that you said don't update automatically.
[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:50.700]   But that has changed.
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:53.980]   If you mark an app as manual update only,
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.900]   and you tap update all, now the Play Store will prompt you
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:59.740]   and say, hey, you marked this app for manual update
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:06.540]   do you want to or not, which is a nice little bit of choice.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:08.420]   Jeff Jarvis is a number.
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:10.980]   Let's take a look at your number, Jeff.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:13.740]   We have 801 total votes.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:18.140]   73 people said just get an LTE Nexus 7.
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:20.940]   87 people said you should not open the Moto X
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:21.820]   and use it right now.
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:25.660]   167 people said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:30.020]   I love how that now advanced over the simple no.
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:38.940]   But the winner is with a total of 474 votes, 59% said yes.
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:41.180]   So Jeff, I think--
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:42.020]   There we go.
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:43.060]   He's got to open it.
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:43.780]   That's sound--
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:47.620]   It's $674 going down the old--
[01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:50.300]   Oh, no, you can return it.
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:53.020]   I'm amazed that they're letting you return a customized one.
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:55.660]   I guess you could peel the back off.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:57.820]   So here it is.
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:35:58.820]   Blue.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:35:59.340]   Nice.
[01:35:59.340 --> 01:35:59.860]   Nice slate blue.
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:00.380]   A lot.
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.380]   A lot.
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:02.180]   Very pretty.
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:02.540]   Nice.
[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:03.700]   Very pretty.
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:05.100]   And I won't text while I'm driving.
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.740]   Yeah, don't even turn it on because you
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:08.940]   have to call AT&T before you turn it on.
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:09.740]   I'll just warn you.
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:10.300]   You do?
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:11.740]   Yeah.
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:12.580]   Well, they want you to.
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:13.660]   It says there's a little thing in there.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:15.740]   So don't turn it on.
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:16.740]   Oh, I'll give you a tip.
[01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:17.240]   OK.
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:19.420]   I'll tell you how to-- you got it off contract, right?
[01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:20.340]   Or no.
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:21.220]   Yes, off contract.
[01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:23.420]   So you don't have a magic number.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:25.100]   So what you do is you call AT&T and you say,
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:26.700]   I want to make a hardware swap.
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:29.860]   I found out this after three hours on hold.
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:31.420]   I called Motorola.
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:33.820]   They didn't know what to do.
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:34.980]   So finally, I called AT&T.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:35.860]   They said, oh, yeah, that's a hard--
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:36.940]   Motorola said, call AT&T.
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:38.620]   Tell me you want to make a hardware swap.
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:42.060]   And you have to have the numbers, the SIM numbers--
[01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:42.700]   The EBITDA ID.
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:45.700]   --ICCID and the IMEIs, the hardware number.
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:47.060]   You need both those numbers.
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:49.980]   And they'll take your old phone offline and replay your Nexus
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:51.980]   for and replace it with this.
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:53.180]   You know what?
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.660]   If you don't like it, Jeff, your money back,
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:57.980]   we will send you a check for that phone.
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.420]   Seriously.
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:36:59.940]   No, no, no.
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:00.460]   Seriously.
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:01.180]   Boy, wow.
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:02.980]   No, we'll buy it from you, Jeff.
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:04.220]   I don't want you to--
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:08.220]   You were pressured into this by the straw poll.
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:09.380]   Chat room.
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:09.940]   Chat room.
[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:12.500]   So I feel bad, since you don't have a Bluetooth car.
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.740]   I volunteered.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:14.940]   I volunteered.
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:16.460]   I feel so bad.
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:17.060]   I'm--
[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:18.700]   I just need an excuse.
[01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:22.100]   But honey, Leo made me do it.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:23.900]   You said you were going to return that phone.
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:24.980]   But Leo's not--
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:25.940]   And I'll pay up.
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.500]   I'll buy it from you, Jeff, really seriously.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:28.740]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:29.740]   It's for your job.
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:31.300]   That's what I-- that's what I say.
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:32.860]   Also, we had to talk about the zen
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:36.300]   of being happy with the phone you have and not the phone
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:38.460]   that you want, not tortured by the phone that you want.
[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:39.140]   That's true.
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:39.660]   That is--
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:40.660]   That is very true.
[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:43.860]   Now, Jeff, did you get the Motorola skip?
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:45.660]   Yeah, they said that was true.
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:46.860]   This is kind of cool.
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:47.940]   They're way overpriced.
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:51.580]   This is $20 for a magnet and an RF chip.
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:55.340]   That's crazy, an FC chip.
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:58.940]   So the idea of this is it clips onto something
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:02.460]   like your lapel or your visor in your car.
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.780]   And then you can lock your phone.
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:07.660]   So my tip, actually, is that you probably
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:10.260]   know that you can encrypt the contents of your phone.
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.420]   But it's a pain in the butt when you do it,
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.060]   because you have to-- you can't just
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:15.780]   use one of those patterns.
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:19.580]   You have to have a long number or password, which
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:20.900]   is a pain to enter.
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:23.580]   Well, now, thanks to the skip and the Bluetooth
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.100]   authentication, which also will unlock it if you want.
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:28.060]   My phone's unlocked right now.
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:29.540]   In fact, I'm trying to lock it.
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:31.740]   And I can't, because it's attached
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.740]   to the Bluetooth on my computer.
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:36.460]   But that means you can say, OK, Google now.
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:38.580]   And all that stuff continues to work, right?
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.300]   So this is a nice feature.
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:41.060]   And I like the skip.
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:42.820]   It's crazy expensive.
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:44.740]   So I'm going to look into if there's
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:48.420]   some way to get a regular cheap NFC chip and use it
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:49.180]   or something like that.
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:50.140]   Oh, good idea.
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:51.780]   Because they do sell little-- they're going to sell little
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.460]   dots.
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.420]   But $20 for this is nuts.
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:56.700]   Did it also come with those--
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:58.180]   I saw some reference on the package.
[01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:02.260]   It came with those things, the little dot things
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:03.180]   you can put on desk or something.
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:04.780]   It does not come with them.
[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:05.260]   What does it come with?
[01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:08.180]   Unless I threw them out by accident.
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:09.340]   It comes with one skip.
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:11.180]   They say they're going to make them.
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:12.660]   Maybe it did.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:15.580]   And I just didn't see it.
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:19.180]   I saved my packaging, so I'll look through it.
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:20.460]   But yeah, that would be cool.
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:21.420]   You put that on the desk.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:24.740]   You put that on the car visor.
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:25.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.340]   And then you just tap it on there.
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:27.420]   And it's unlocked.
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:28.940]   And you do want to keep this phone.
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:30.500]   I think it's important to have using
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:31.900]   encryption on your phone.
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:33.820]   So I'm glad I did turn it on.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:36.700]   It takes a while to encrypt it.
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:39.180]   But I never used it before because I had to enter all that
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:40.140]   stuff.
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:41.220]   Now it's not a big deal.
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:41.900]   So I think that's good.
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.380]   Now you can fly through London.
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:44.820]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:47.820]   But come on, Motorola, really?
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:48.780]   Yeah, $20.
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:50.420]   $20, really?
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:53.980]   That's worse than the $30 for a bumper case on an iPhone.
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:54.740]   Well, yeah.
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:56.540]   And we know the profit margin of the price of this thing.
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:58.740]   $6,174 throw it in.
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:39:59.540]   Yeah.
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:00.300]   Yeah, throw it in.
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:00.740]   It's true.
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:01.460]   Yo, no kidding.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:02.460]   That's a good point.
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:04.340]   These only cost $20, $21 to make.
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:05.020]   Exactly.
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:07.420]   I mean, if you really want to differentiate the product,
