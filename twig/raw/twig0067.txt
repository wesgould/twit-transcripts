[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.520]   And today, Facebook, joining us, Gina Trapani
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.840]   from her home in San Diego.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.240]   She blogs at smartaware.org.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.800]   And is also a blogger for Fast Company.

[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.120]   of videos.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.040]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.680]   Hi.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.040]   Good to see you.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.880]   Good to see you.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.880]   Good to see you.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.520]   Yay.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.000]   Yay.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.720]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis, who is at the post office.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.120]   Believe it or not.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.640]   Well, he's a little more than the post office.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.120]   Oh, and the post office.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.880]   He's at the world headquarters of the post office.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.760]   At the office of the inspector general.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.280]   Wow.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.720]   I'm loved.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.240]   That's a great title.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.080]   Isn't this great?
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.120]   It sounds something like a--
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.520]   I asked you to do the column general.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.160]   They said no.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.680]   It's so Gilbert and Sullivan.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.360]   I am the married model of the modern inspector general.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.840]   Jeff is a blogger at blogmash--
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.680]   Buzzmachine.com, professor--
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.920]   tenured professor of journalism at the city
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.000]   University of New York.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.560]   And the author--
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.200]   He works tax dollars at work.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.880]   Not mine.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.920]   Just yours.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.360]   And the author of this fine book, what the hell would Google
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.360]   do now?
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.800]   What-- maybe you should do a sequel, what should Google do?
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.640]   That'd be fun.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.080]   He's actually working on a new book about public and private
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.440]   parts.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.320]   It's called public parts.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.880]   Also joining us, we really always love having him on the show,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.160]   Kevin Purdy, who is a blogger at Life Hacker.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.040]   And also-- what's your title at Life Hacker?
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.400]   I am a contributing editor.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.800]   So that's more than a blogger.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   Yes.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   That's what that is.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.320]   It's a more than a blogger.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.600]   That's what all those complex tech documents mean.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.000]   He's also the author of the complete guide
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.080]   at googleandroid.com.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.760]   It's a real book, too, though, not just a web book, right?
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.560]   It is.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.920]   Paper, e-book, e-pub, and all that.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.520]   In every form.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.360]   But a true expert on Android, which is a good thing,
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.080]   because we always talk a lot about Android.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.840]   We're Android fans here at the old show.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.320]   We are running a little late today
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.600]   because there was a big event at Facebook headquarters.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.800]   They're Facebook mobile event.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.760]   I'll summarize, and then you guys can talk.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.000]   First of all, just a personal note.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.720]   Mark Zuckerberg let it off.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.520]   He's lately been taking the mic more and more
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.600]   with Facebook events and actually showed himself really well.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.720]   I thought he was articulate.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.280]   He came off as smart, funny, and actually got off a good one
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.200]   because at the end of the Q&A somebody
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.720]   said, how come you don't have a mobile app for the iPad?
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.800]   And he said, iPad's not mobile.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.000]   Really a dismissive tone.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.840]   It's not mobile.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.360]   No, it's not.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.120]   I thought he really came off very well.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.040]   He introduced-- he talked a little bit about the fact
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.880]   that mobile has become bigger and bigger for the Facebook
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.480]   platform.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   200 million mobile users this year up from 65 million
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.840]   a year ago.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.120]   He mentioned that they're going to be on every platform.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.000]   Of course, they're already on Android and iPhone,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.080]   but Windows Mobile 7, BlackBerry, Nokia.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   And he also really underscored the mobile web,
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.120]   saying a lot of these phones use browsers,
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.360]   and we're there too.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.560]   I'm sure that's his solution for the iPad.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.400]   And announced new versions of the Facebook application,
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.840]   the official Facebook application, for both iPhone
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.200]   and Android.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.920]   The Android one is out now 1.4 and has added places.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.320]   So it's got parity with the iPhone.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.840]   It's added groups.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.480]   And I imagine somewhere buried in there
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.880]   are some of the other features they announced.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.800]   They had three big initiatives they announced.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.480]   One is a single sign-on.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.040]   They already have Facebook Connect on the web.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.520]   As you browse around, you want to log into many sites.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.320]   You just press the Facebook Connect button
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.960]   and use your Facebook credentials
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.000]   to log into the site to create an account.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.240]   Now that'll be available on mobile.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.680]   They're calling it a single sign-on.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.160]   They also announced a change to the Places API,
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.720]   the Location API.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.840]   Previously, I didn't know this.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.160]   It was only readable.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.780]   But now applications and everybody's apparently
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.600]   on board with this, including 4-square, Goala, Looped,
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.960]   and Yelp, the big location players,
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.800]   all can write to the Facebook API.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.080]   So in the past, in fact, this is how I do it,
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.320]   I log into 4-square.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.080]   And because I use the 4-square application on Facebook,
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.880]   it automatically adds that to my stream.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.840]   But it doesn't update my location on Facebook.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.080]   It doesn't integrate very tightly.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.840]   Now it will.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.880]   Now they have parity with Facebook itself
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.120]   in terms of location logins.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.420]   And that ties to a new Facebook platform, one
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.140]   in which, by the way, Mark Zuckerberg says,
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.500]   we're not going to make any money on, which surprised me.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.300]   Phenomenal.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.420]   Called deals.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.860]   Did the idea of deals is very much like 4-square.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.380]   Yelp just added the same thing, which
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.860]   is when you check in to a location,
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.860]   the owner of the location can offer you a deal.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.140]   And there's actually kind of a nice little side effect
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.860]   that to the way Facebook does its places,
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.500]   where you could check in other people.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.940]   One of the deals could be, for instance,
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.980]   check in with three of your friends.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.980]   And you all get a free cup of coffee.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.360]   So really some real potential to monetize this.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.900]   And yet, Mark says, we just want to build a platform.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.360]   We're not going to make any money on that.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   That surprised you.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.880]   They're not getting a cut at all of that?
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.600]   No, cut it all, he said.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.560]   And now the 4-square--
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.920]   It's because you know how it's supposed to be.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.920]   Pardon me?
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.660]   It means the 4-square is going to cut.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.080]   4-square probably gets a cut.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.460]   I don't know.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.280]   Nobody said.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.180]   And yes, Jeff, to answer your question,
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.160]   they can make money on it because they are certainly
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.240]   going to incur it.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.680]   Somebody said, well, how will you
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.580]   know if there's an offer?
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.480]   And there's several ways.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.060]   One is the store can buy an ad that'll show up.
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.780]   The other way is if your friend takes advantage of the offer,
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.420]   it shows up in their stream, which
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.020]   could show up in your live stream.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.220]   And the third is the one you'd expect, which is if you check in
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.900]   or you're to that place, it will then pop up.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.020]   They said they're very careful.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.620]   They do not want to start pushing ads
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.060]   at you due to the proximity of a place, which I think
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.260]   that would be a concern for everybody if all of a sudden
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:38.760]   you would.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.420]   It would be neat to be able to say, oh, here
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.140]   I am with them all.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.180]   And he deals around me?
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.840]   I think you can do that, Jeff.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.640]   That was the implication.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.000]   So that you could say, I'm here.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.540]   What's around?
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.480]   But you asked.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.240]   But you have to ask.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.920]   They can't push it.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.080]   And so isn't it true also, Leo, then
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.540]   that they provided a tool so that if I'm Jeff's cupcake
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.300]   store, I can just put a deal up there?
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.660]   Yes.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.420]   Now, right now it's only available to people
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.460]   who are their beta partners.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.240]   And they have a number of beta partners.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   But the implications--
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.240]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.740]   Have you really got your help, baby?
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.240]   Yeah, baby.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.740]   Woo!
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.560]   So happy.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.920]   I can't wait for those Applebee deals.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.200]   But presumably, eventually everybody can do it,
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.520]   as they can with Four Square.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.960]   Olive Garden, Britsticks for all.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.120]   Well, Jeff is a noob Chipotle lover,
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.960]   so his excitement is especially--
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.040]   Oh, it's not speeches.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.160]   I thought he was mocking.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:33.840]   No, no, no.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.840]   I was pretty rock.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.680]   Keep it so as an early to avoid the lie.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.160]   It should be dark and special.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.160]   You go to the Jeff Jarvis Early Bird special at Chipotle.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.080]   I'm mad that I go to this one so often, I'm not there yet.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.560]   I should at least be on the friggin city council.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.160]   That's what they need.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.040]   They need a host of titles.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.240]   You could be the vice-maker.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.240]   I need to be Parks and Director, my nearby Chipotle.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.160]   That's what I want to be.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.400]   What is it about Chipotle--
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.880]   I'm sorry, I hate to digress here.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.640]   But what is it about Chipotle?
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.880]   Is it you like so much?
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.720]   Love Chipotle.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.320]   You too?
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.260]   I do.
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:08.760]   I do.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.260]   I see, Gina.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.920]   I could believe that because of Jeff
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.440]   because he's in New York where you probably
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.680]   can't get a good burrito.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.680]   But you're in freaking San Diego.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.200]   It's true.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.880]   Even here in San Diego, which has some of the best
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.160]   burritos in the country, 20 minutes in the Mexican border,
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.720]   I still do go to Chipotle.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.080]   There's the whole whole five.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.040]   The food's really good.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.960]   And it's affordable.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.080]   And yeah, it's really good.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.480]   It's popular here for sure.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.080]   I've never been to a Chipotle.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.960]   [GASP]
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.360]   Oh, Leo.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.720]   We're going to have to fix that.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.200]   Are you American?
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.720]   Do we have Chipotle?
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.440]   Is it a place here?
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.440]   Yeah, there's one nearby.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.120]   Down in San Rafael, I could go.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.680]   Maybe we'll do it.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.200]   You've got to go.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.000]   You've got to go.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.040]   I get the vegetarian bowl a little bit
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.040]   of rice, a lot of black beans.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.760]   And then you pick which sauce that you want.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.200]   And they get cheese and guac.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.640]   And I'm very happy guy.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.120]   Yeah, that's also in the guac are really good.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.640]   Two best indicators of a mixed berries.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.200]   Burritos are just delivery mechanisms for guacamole, really.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.040]   Absolutely true.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.520]   And sour cream, if you really want to get crazy.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.280]   It's just an API to get guacamole.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.680]   That's a guacamole platform.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.680]   It is.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.640]   A guacamole platform.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.280]   And now to bring us back, that's what this is all about for Facebook.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.480]   And very clearly now they're saying, we're the platform.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.480]   When you log in, you log in with Facebook.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.720]   When you check in, you check in with Facebook.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.800]   Explain it, where you're explaining that to me.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.120]   So if I log in to the Facebook app on my phone, I've now logged into other apps?
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.120]   No.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.000]   And you see this already with Facebook Connect.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.240]   When you go to Yelp and it says you want to log in or press the button.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   What's the difference?
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   It's exactly the same.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.400]   It's just never been available on mobile.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   Mobile, remember, mobile doesn't--
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400]   Oh, I see.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.600]   Yeah, mobile doesn't use the same.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   It's not using, unless you're using the browser, it's not using HTTP.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:50.560]   So these mobile apps communicate differently with Facebook and with each other.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.920]   So all, it's, I don't know, maybe you can help me with this.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.240]   Gina or Kevin, because you guys might know better.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.480]   But it sounds like they've provided essentially an API for using Facebook Connect, but not
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.080]   over HTTP.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.000]   I'm a little confused, too, because on Android and maybe Gina can clarify, it sounds like
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.360]   it's for web apps, mostly, because on Android, Twitter clients, 4square, whatever app you're
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.160]   using, usually you set up your username and password once in the settings, and then you're
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.920]   done until you uninstall it.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   It sounds like maybe they're using Facebook Connect to let you log into web apps, I'm assuming.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   No, no.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.520]   I think this is-- well, it's functionally the same.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.600]   I'm honestly not sure.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.600]   I was also going to ask you guys about that.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.560]   I think it's like open ID.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:43.600]   So if you go to use an app, you could log in with your native password and log in for
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.240]   that app.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.920]   Or some apps will now start presenting.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.080]   I haven't seen any yet, but I'll look around tonight presenting or just as they do on the
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.360]   web or use Facebook.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.600]   And then if-- now, this is the question.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.800]   If you've already authenticated with Facebook, is that sufficient?
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   Probably it is.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.360]   Maybe they renew it every few weeks, whatever.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.920]   The way they showed it on the screen at the event is it pulls up that kind of-- you've
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.920]   seen it all.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   We've all seen it before.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.120]   Connect with Facebook, and you have to press and allow, don't allow.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.560]   It shows you what permissions.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.640]   They say that the permission-- now, this is very interesting, and this is, again, this
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.320]   is the platformization of Facebook.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:25.920]   Your Facebook permissions now apply to your transactions with this third party.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.840]   And now that does make it into your publicness tool.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.800]   So Facebook is not-- I think from the beginning, it should have branded itself as a sharing
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   tool.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.880]   And so now you have the rules of your sharing.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.880]   That's very cool.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.880]   Isn't that-- yeah.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.040]   I mean, I think-- I can't find any real problems with this except maybe the potential
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.240]   security issue, you know, and the problem with a single sign on is potentially-- if
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.520]   it's not implemented properly, I think if you lose your password, you're screwed.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.360]   I mean, if you're signed in on a web browser on a desktop now to Facebook and you've also
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.120]   connected to other accounts, if you open another tab and go to one of those other web
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.200]   apps that you have connected, you're in.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.400]   Yeah, there's no extra step, right?
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.880]   I think they're saying you just don't want to have to keep typing your passwords in on
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.040]   your mobile phone, not packing away on your phone.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   Right, exactly.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   I don't.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.840]   And iPhone users don't either, do they?
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.280]   I mean, the apps that you've installed keep your username and password.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.360]   I mean, unless you want to be logged out all the time or something, like for, you know,
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:29.000]   link.com, I don't stay logged in, but you know, the apps are usually just preloaded
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   and that's why you use apps, I thought.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.240]   Yeah, it's a good point.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.240]   I don't know.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.600]   Well, but every time I write that typing in user names and passwords on a mobile website
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.080]   is a pain in the rear and they demonstrated that during the presentation.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:49.200]   But most apps usually just hold your login information until you need to enter it again
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.200]   after X months or something.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.520]   Or we all install so many new apps, maybe it's just, you know, that's because of pain.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.480]   Right for you, Leo, it does make total sense.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.720]   Um, and for anyone who's trying out a lot of apps, yeah, I guess if I, for using an app
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.840]   for the first time, it would be pretty easy to just hit the blue Facebook connect and
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   go from there.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:13.400]   I mean, I think if you're building an app, guys, Gina, developer lady, you build this
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.120]   into your app now because it just be foolish not to, right?
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.200]   It's just a super easy way to sign in, right?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.640]   You don't want people to have to sign in, go through the painful process of the email,
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.400]   the name, and then so it is a super easy way to sign in.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.320]   So yeah, if your, if your audience is on Facebook and most likely they are because who
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.520]   isn't, then it makes sense to do this for an app, app developer, for sure.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.560]   They do have, it turns out a Facebook connect for iPhone and Android.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.920]   So this is not that.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.360]   This is in addition to that.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:47.760]   Um, so it is for, you know, the first time you log into an app, the partners that they announced
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:54.880]   with were Zinga group on looped scavenger, which is actually kind of a cool location-based
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.480]   play that hasn't gotten a lot of attention, but deserves it.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.000]   Yelp, Flickster and Boo-yah.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.240]   I like the name.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.240]   What is Boo-yah?
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.240]   I don't know.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   No idea.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:12.120]   So, uh, I guess it's, it's bringing Facebook connect, the Web style Facebook connect to
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.000]   stand alone apps.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And I imagine, of course, once you've got that connection between the app and Facebook, there's
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.160]   all sorts of stuff going on now back and forth between it and Facebook.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.760]   You can now like and, and, uh, and do other stuff.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.800]   And presumably, I guess the real question and the thing that will really upset users is
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:36.000]   if all of a sudden more and more of your activity outside of Facebook is streamed to your Facebook
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   activity stream.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   I mean, it's, my activity streams are already jamming.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.240]   That's what it comes in though.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.520]   That's, that's where it's going to, it's going to, you know, not put stuff in there.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.920]   You know, that's the essence of the newsfeed algorithm is that it's selective.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.800]   I always watch the live algorithm, which is not selective.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   It's just whatever's happening.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.920]   But I think increasingly people are going to say, no, I don't, I will watch the new, the,
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.920]   the selected one.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.920]   And I guess that's based on the number of likes and comments.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.520]   So you, if you, if you just get your newsfeed, you don't see everything.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.960]   You just see the things that people are interacting with.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.040]   My selfish nightmare is that I'll, is that I'll tell my wife, you know, oh, having leftovers
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   for lunch.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   And then she sees Kevin picked up a coupon at Chipotle.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.920]   And she'll realize my sham.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.920]   If that's all you're worried about, Kevin, I think you're going to be okay.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.920]   Well, right.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.960]   More, more, you know, if you're having lunch at the, the chicken ranch, that might be another
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   problem in time.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.960]   Right.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   And like just saying hopefully the algorithm will be smart enough to not show my friends
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.720]   that my friends shouldn't care.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   As Eric Schmidt.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.880]   So wisely said, if you're not doing anything you're ashamed of, there's nothing to worry
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.880]   about.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.880]   He's there.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.880]   And shame.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:43.880]   Shame.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.880]   And a delicious shame.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.880]   Google kill shame.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.760]   There is no more shame.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.760]   It's dead now.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.920]   We talked, there was another, they didn't, you know, there are a couple of things they
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.920]   didn't mention.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:58.880]   And in fact, looked like they actively prevented journalists and stream viewers from asking.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.760]   One was this fire sheep issue, which is this really significant security issue.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.320]   I installed it on my Firefox.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.000]   It's a plug-in from codebutler.com that you install on your Firefox.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.640]   And what it does is it traps these tokens, these cookies that Facebook says, you know,
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.600]   when you go from page to page on Facebook, it has to authenticate you at each page because
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.120]   a browser doesn't know that you're the same person or not.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.120]   So every web app, right?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.120]   Every web app.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.120]   Every web app does this.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.120]   So instead of saying, well, what's the login?
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.120]   What's the login?
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.120]   What's the login?
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.120]   Which will be incredibly annoying.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.560]   The first time you log into Facebook, it sends you a cookie, which is an identifying token
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.440]   that has a limited, you know, has an expiration date, usually, you know, just the session.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.240]   And then from now on from page to page, the pages says, well, what's the token?
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   Can you say swordfish?
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.680]   And it says, okay, it's you.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.640]   Well, it's always been possible using hacker tools like can enable to capture that token
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.320]   in an open access spot.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.880]   Firesheet just makes it really easy.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.120]   So I put it on my laptop.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.280]   I go to my local coffee shop.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.600]   I see a list and pictures even of everybody who's on Facebook, Yelp, even Google, not
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.840]   Google mail because it uses HTTPS, but the rest of Google, I could see their pictures
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.200]   from those sites.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.480]   I can double click them.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.000]   So if I see, I see a Gina.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.080]   Oh, there's Gina Trapani.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.080]   Oh, she's cute.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.080]   I double click her.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.600]   And then from her Facebook page, I can leave stuff as her all without a password.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.640]   Yes, I actually reached out to a fast company directly to get their statement on this as
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.440]   I wrote a story about firesheet for fast company.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.520]   And they, this is exactly what they told me.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.920]   They said we've been making, making progress, testing SSL across Facebook and hope to provide
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.200]   it as an option in the coming months.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.000]   As always, we advise people to use caution when sending or receiving information over
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.400]   unsecured Wi-Fi networks, check out the Facebook security page, FTC's on God Online.gov website,
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   blah, blah.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.280]   Be careful about the information you access or send from a public wireless network.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.160]   To be on the safe side, assume that other people can access any information you see
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.280]   or send a public wireless network.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.040]   That's kind of missing the boat because that's not what's, that's not merely what's happening
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   here.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.040]   No, it is.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.800]   And then he says, you know, additional points, Facebook logins are always encrypted.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.900]   We knew that.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.480]   We offer session control feature that lets people view all their active Facebook sessions,
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.840]   but who looks, you know, who's looking at that every moment as they, as they use it.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.160]   So you know, yeah, this is a problem with every website, right?
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.440]   Because each, every HTTP request is completely independent of the one pre before it or after.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.440]   Like, it's stateless.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.960]   It doesn't know if you're logged in.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.360]   So it has, every single request does have to include log and information, but that information
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.360]   should be encrypted.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.440]   And this is a, this is a problem that lots of people, you know, people have known for
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.440]   a really long time.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.120]   I mean, Google knew they just, what they encrypted Gmail, but you know, they just did
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.120]   that pretty recently.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.880]   And by the way, they still haven't encrypted anything else.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.120]   So if somebody uses fire sheep, they could see I'm on Google.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.080]   They can go look at my web history.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   They could change my search settings.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.840]   They can do a lot of things.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.840]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.840]   Right.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.840]   So Google wasn't totally immune either.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.240]   Gmail, yes, but not, but not just a regular Google account.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.320]   So you know, this is a good thing.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.880]   Websites are going to, are going to secure this.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.000]   They're going to start transmitting cookies over SSL.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.400]   It should have happened a really long time ago.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.200]   I'm actually glad that Eric did this.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.200]   It forces the issue.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   Exactly.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.520]   And even though there will be collateral damage for sure.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.160]   Lots of college campuses.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.280]   College campuses, that's exactly where it's happening right now.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.040]   So if you are in a coffee, an open access coffee shop and you log into Facebook, you,
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.200]   I think you have a million people have downloaded this thing.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.320]   You could pretty much assume that somebody could log in as you.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:27.040]   I, I just as a demonstration of the cottage log, you know, said, log in Lisa's account
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.960]   and said, this is Leo.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.600]   I just hacked Lisa's account on her status message.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.640]   I mean, it's a really, it's not a good thing.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.400]   However, this is presumably something you would want to ask Facebook.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   Yes.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.440]   No, nobody in present asked about it.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.280]   And I'm told by one of our chatters who asked the question in the chat that that question
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.520]   was immediately deleted from chat.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.640]   So I think this is something that Facebook did not want to deal with.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.760]   I talked to Steve Gibson, our security guy.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.240]   And it's his opinion that the web apps, this single sign on for web apps is not impacted
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.480]   by fire sheep because web apps, rather mobile apps are not like web apps.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.640]   They do not use HTTP.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.880]   They do not use HTTP tokens.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.120]   So it does not affect web apps.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.800]   And in fact, that was my experience just empirically.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.400]   I could not see people who were logged on to Facebook.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.800]   For instance, through a web app, I could see if they use Safari.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.880]   I'm also you see that.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.880]   Sorry.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.120]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.680]   Is there a fix that you can make to a browser that fixes this fixes?
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.760]   There are a couple of Firefox plugins.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.800]   HTTPS everywhere is the one that people recommend that will kind of fix it.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:42.640]   And you can tell the open access spot owner, as I did with my local coffee shop, please
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.480]   turn on WPA2, which she did.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.480]   That fixes it.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:52.480]   Wouldn't it be a lot easier if we're asking is it logically possible, is it the realm
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.400]   of possibility that you could make a change in the architecture of Chrome or Firefox?
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.400]   No.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.280]   It ultimately requires SSL be offered by these sites.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.280]   Facebook has to turn on.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.400]   Now, Google did an interesting thing the day after fire sheep came out, they posted
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.400]   on the Google blog.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.840]   By the way, it was trivially easy for us to turn on HTTPS on Gmail.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.840]   It uses very little server resources.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.640]   They said less than 10K per login, less than 1% of CPU to turn on SSL.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:25.080]   Their message was to counter the kind of common misconception that SSL is CPU intensive
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   or resource intensive.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.080]   It isn't.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.680]   It costs us nothing.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.040]   Everybody should do this.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.160]   And yet you can still see Google accounts and fire sheep.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.120]   I mean, yeah, they turn it on for Gmail only.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.880]   Well, you know, well, that's the soft spot.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.880]   But if, for instance, I could probably log into your wave account, I could probably log
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.680]   into Google groups.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.520]   I think we'll see.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.720]   Oh, yeah, I guess I won't be logging into your wave account.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.600]   Well, because my wave account won't be all around much longer.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.520]   This is protected because Buzz is Gmail, essentially.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.520]   Interesting.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.520]   Other than--
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.520]   I'll be honest.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:07.760]   On the whole, though, I'd say Mark Zuckerberg was much more prepared for opening up to questions
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.800]   and then having the next five questions immediately be privacy.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.000]   He was ready to answer the questions.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.920]   And I think he handled it very well, don't you?
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.600]   And location, you know, right away, someone asked about the privacy matters around, you
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.360]   know, the coupons and the local coupons.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.480]   And he said, you know, right away, this is opt in.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.200]   You have to be, like you said, like searching for those coupons locally that nobody can
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.560]   push him to you unless you, you know, like Chipotle and want to be receptive to Chipotle.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:40.680]   He did the little Mark Zuckerberg dismissive thing where he goes, no, like, oh, you're so
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   stupid.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.680]   No, more is not.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.600]   But if you didn't catch him off guard, I'm sorry he was prepared.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.960]   He's just, you know, I don't know if he's gone through media training or what, but he's
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   much more--
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.560]   You don't see the sweaty, sweaty zuck anymore.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.560]   No, and I don't know.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.800]   Which wasn't that long ago, you're right.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.280]   But I remember when I first saw him at a public event, I think it was the Four Square Conference
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.920]   in New York, which is coming out, which is closed and he's just the dearly headlight
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.920]   things because he's scared.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.800]   And I think he's just, he's gone through such hell now that, you know, what's okay, what's
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.120]   going to happen to me?
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.760]   And he's more like the Zuckerberg that I've seen when I've, you know, met him face to
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.400]   face.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.760]   Very confident, very smart.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.320]   Anything he has that little arrogance thing that Jobs has, Bill Gates had where he's, you
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   know, I'm--
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.320]   Name a mogul who doesn't.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.320]   Right.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.320]   That's how you need that.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.320]   You have to have that.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.320]   Have you one mogul?
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.320]   No.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.320]   Or politician.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.320]   Stick with mobile.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.320]   Who doesn't have that?
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.320]   Right.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.320]   Well, if any politician has it, it's phony.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.320]   Actually, I can name one.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   I can name one.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   Who?
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.320]   You.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.400]   I'm not a mogul, that's why.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.200]   Wait until I get to be a mogul and then I'll treat you all like crap.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   The crap you are.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.200]   No, it's really true.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.720]   You've met far more of these people than I have, Jeff, but you have to have a certain
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.760]   grandiosity and courage of spirit to be these guys.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   Right.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   I'm not sick, Ronald.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.680]   There's nothing's anything wrong with it.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.000]   But they really do think they're the smartest guy in the room.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.560]   I mean, it's always apparent.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.160]   Of course, Gina, you think you know you're the smartest woman in the room.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.160]   Oh, cool.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.160]   Why?
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.160]   I wasn't even listening to you.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.720]   You walk into any room.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   Sorry, didn't mean to to.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.240]   Oh, this is dirt my deep thoughts.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   I did, apparently.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.720]   I was going to say earlier, like Facebook could grown up.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.920]   It's a mature platform.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.160]   I think that Mark is growing up.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.840]   I think about that, that dorky picture of Bill Gates when he was like 19 draped over
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.080]   that desk that was taken to like, he did something.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.040]   You know, like someday we're going to be, you know, 20, 30 years from now, we're going
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.440]   to be watching those, you know, interviews with Zuckerberg when he was sweating at 21.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.440]   And we're going to laugh.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.240]   He's growing up and it's maturing.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.880]   And yeah, I think about the way that Mark presents Facebook and like the way that the
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   Facebook staff kind of talks about the platform and the way that the Twitter leaders kind of
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:01.640]   talk about Twitter and on the Twitter side, they all haven't seemed to, it's like, they're
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.920]   all kind of still in awe of, you know, how big it grew and how fast it's going and what
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   it does.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.920]   And it seems like it's time to get over that guys.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.760]   Yeah, they need to get over that.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.160]   And Facebook has a little bit more of a maturity about it.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.760]   And was Zuckerberg is winning me, winning me over a little bit.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.760]   Me too.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.760]   Yeah, the way to change.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.080]   If you play us back for what?
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.080]   Six months ago.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.000]   I was furious with him.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.680]   Eight weeks ago, probably.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.680]   No, yeah.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.680]   Recently.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.960]   Now, all right, let me go back to that old disgruntled Leo.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.680]   I have to say that this is clearly.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.920]   I mean, Facebook's just saying we want everything on the web to go through us and we, and maybe
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.120]   we won't get that on the web.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.920]   But boy, we're going to get it mobile.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.560]   You know, use our check in.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.560]   Use our, use our location.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.560]   You know, use our APIs.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   Is there anything wrong with that?
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.800]   Are you switching cost becomes harder and harder and harder.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.920]   And the next time Leo, you're going to think twice before you quit Facebook, right?
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   I can't, you know what?
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.840]   I'm glad now that I'm a member just so I can try this stuff out.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.680]   They're insinuating a real deal.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   Oh, sorry.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.040]   No, no, go ahead, Jeff.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.560]   Quick question.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.280]   So you cleared all your friends and you had to rebuild your friends.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.600]   What's the, what's the overlap?
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   How did that structure work?
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.600]   Well, I was, I had misused Facebook from day one and I, I friended everybody, right?
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.160]   So I was at the maximum 5,000.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.120]   I've deleted the everybody.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.440]   I have a fan page, which I don't know what that's at now.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.440]   It's still not 5,000.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.480]   And I have a friend page, which is a 200.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.200]   It's just real, it's actual friends.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   You guys, it's actual friends.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   Actually, it's not Kevin.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.200]   I don't know you.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.560]   But it's, no, I'm just kidding.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.680]   But it's, but actually, Gina, you're not my friend.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.800]   I'm a fan, but I don't think you're my friend.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.960]   Yeah, we have to, I'm kind of hidden on Facebook.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   I'll friend you.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.000]   I think it's just, I think it's just use it that way, especially now.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   But at the same time, I'm glad.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.080]   Now I have to say there's scary stuff on faith.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.080]   Look at this.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.720]   This is one of the things that Facebook just launched is this view, you and another person.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.600]   So here's Molly Woods, my friend Molly Woods page.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.480]   I click this link that says view, you and Molly.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.080]   And then it shows all the interactions we've had.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.080]   I think that's cool.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.240]   Well, it's a little scary because everything new is scary.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.880]   But it kind of implies a relationship where maybe none exists, you know?
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.880]   These are pictures.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.880]   Oh, that's true.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.000]   You know, like, well, I did it with Tom Merritt and Veronica Belmont.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.880]   Now Tom's wife, Eileen, is my esteemed producer.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.160]   But if you looked at this, you might think that Tom and Veronica had something going
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.160]   on.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.320]   It's the internet never forgets.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.960]   Like the thing that happened in 2007 could look just as legitimate as a thing that's been
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.840]   yesterday, whereas the thing that happened yesterday is more important to you because
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:39.040]   as humans, things fade in our memory and relationships cool, but on the internet, they don't.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   Right.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   You either are or you aren't.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.920]   Anil and I were talking about this just the other day.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.120]   I think it's really cool to have this sort of memory of interactions that you've had
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.120]   with someone.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.160]   But it also, I agree with you, Leo.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.960]   It's this, you know, permanent record of something that happened forever ago that might
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.160]   not be as important as it seems.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   There's no context.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.360]   There's no contextualization at all.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.360]   Yes.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:05.440]   And this to me in a nutshell is exactly what I like and dislike about Facebook because on
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.440]   the one hand, this is Mark Zuckerberg saying, well, your connections are important and
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.440]   I can, we can show you stuff you can't see in any other way.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.040]   We're showing this is the social graph.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.240]   Isn't that cool?
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.120]   And his attitude personally is, isn't that cool?
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.640]   And I think he's a little insensitive to the feelings that people might have.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.960]   Yeah, it's cool, but it's a little creepy too.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.800]   But you keep suggesting my ex wife to be my friend, you know, my ex wife, that was a
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   long time ago.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.320]   It was a horrible divorce.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.560]   Yeah, but you don't have that in there.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.560]   Right.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.440]   And you'll be able to opt out of a certain link, but then again, the logic is that if
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.600]   this person is already your friend, you said they're your friends.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   And didn't you mean this?
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   Right.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   Right.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   Right.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   I have ex girlfriends in there.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.600]   I'm not sure I should.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   Yeah, that's true too.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.640]   Of course, because I'm so old, all of those relationships are pre Facebook.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:58.200]   It's not, I'm not, for me, it's not a big deal, but it, but I guess for my kids, it
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.360]   might be a huge deal that every previous relationship is documented on Facebook.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.080]   Isn't it like newsfeed is basically they're already, you could.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.680]   I think you could find it.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   It's not that you could.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.760]   It's that the computer and the abilities of Facebook to bring disparate data together.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.600]   This is the whole privacy issue.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.480]   You know, it's the same argument you could make about, you know, I remember interviewing
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.640]   somebody 20 years ago where you give them your zip code.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.680]   I can't remember the name of the company, but it was everybody bought their database
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.600]   and they could tell you what magazines you were likely to subscribe to, what car you
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.920]   were likely to drive.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.560]   They knew all sorts of information about you.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.800]   Just from your zip code, the difference is now because of all these big databases and
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   the ability of computers to instantly correlate data, it's not that it wasn't there before,
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.800]   but now they can, now it's brought together in new and interesting ways.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.600]   And of course, that's what Zuckerberg loves.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:55.440]   You know, Alexis, a magical at the Atlantic tech channel, the, the Atlantic's kind of
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.960]   tech face on the web has a, a great post he just put up very recently, why Facebook
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.440]   places will be better than four square and that really is.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:10.440]   And it really answers the question I've been asking about which one of these, you know,
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.800]   check-in services could really float above the others.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.680]   And he says, basically, if I'm, you know, hanging out in the Mission District and I
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.720]   see that three of my friends are at a bar, I'd rather see that at, you know, three of
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.920]   my Facebook connections often go there or there right now.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.880]   I'd rather see that right on the top than, you know, just what happens to be GPS location
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.360]   close to me.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.000]   And he says that just by, by the data mining that Facebook is going to be able to do, I
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.320]   shouldn't use that phrase, but yeah, that's the phrase.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:46.440]   The relational, the relational relationships can be able to mine through your Facebook
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.200]   check-ins and your friends and everything.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:52.240]   It's going to be a much, it could be a much better four square that knows better what
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.080]   you're, I'm more likely to walk into the village beer merchants and I am to walk into
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.800]   cats, critters and fuzzy things.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.200]   I don't like better as a description of this.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.840]   Better is very subjective, but it could be more effective.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.560]   Right, more social.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.600]   Is that more, well, is it good though?
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.600]   I don't know.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.560]   Here's a Nick built in, thanks to Tom Baker for this link in our chat room to Nick built
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.800]   in in the bits blog in the New York Times.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:21.480]   He tells a story of a guy named David McCandless who took years worth of data from Facebook
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.680]   with the help of Facebook scanning 10,000 status updates over a year long period and
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:31.600]   to find out when people break up and the biggest times for breaks up breakups two weeks before
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.760]   Christmas and spring break.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.160]   Christmas Day is the low point.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   It is interesting.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.400]   You can't stand thought of having to endure the holidays with this person.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.880]   You just take care of it beforehand.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.120]   It's like I don't have to buy gifts.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.600]   I don't have to deal with your family.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.680]   Two weeks before Christmas, you're out.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   You're out.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.680]   Pardon us.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.680]   I'm going to Cabo.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   I shouldn't have said that.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   Good thing you wanted to do a lot of show.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680]   Two weeks ago, sorry.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.680]   Go ahead.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:10.480]   A scientist, two scientists, found that the mood on Twitter is predictive of the stock
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.480]   mark.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.480]   Oh yes, I did see that.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.480]   Very accurate.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.760]   I've quoted here before that Twitter, according to others, he was 97% accurate and predicting
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.760]   box office success.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.880]   Have you ever seen Jonathan Harris' We Feel Fine?
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   No.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.680]   He's a brilliant artist.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.320]   I worked with him in day life and he did all kinds of great stuff like the whale hunt.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.160]   I recommend looking him up.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.920]   Just Google We Feel Fine Jonathan Harris.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:38.880]   He took the words "feel" and "feeling" and he has now 14 million data points.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.040]   He plots it in incredible ways.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:47.160]   You can see the time of year when people feel best and worst and connections and ethnicity
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.920]   and age and just all kinds of stuff.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   You know, yeah, correct heaven.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.400]   It's data mining or it's data nudging or I don't know what it is.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.040]   That's all there.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   And it's going to be there.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.960]   I mean, I guess we just have to get used to it.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.720]   Mark Zuckerberg is just ahead of us.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.960]   He's already kind of seen this and likes the idea.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:15.200]   I think the problem is that he doesn't really get why we might not.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.200]   And maybe he's right.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.680]   Maybe he's like you, Jeff.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.560]   He's just saying, you know, you'll get there.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.560]   You want to live in public.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.560]   You just haven't got anything.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.360]   What else happens though, Neil?
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:30.680]   When he does go over, then we beat him up and he says, all right, all right, sorry.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.600]   But you know, he's thinking, you know, he's thinking, oh, they'll get it eventually.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:39.880]   What he said to me, I said beacon was too far ahead and he said, no beacon was mistaken.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.040]   Oh, good.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.040]   That's great.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:48.280]   And he knew it and he knew why just the dynamics, the motivations didn't work for that.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.080]   But places is beacon gone smart.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.080]   Right.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.080]   Yes.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.960]   Now I've checked in.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.640]   I want my burrito.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:02.600]   You opt to get the guac and I can choose to tell my friends, Jeff just had guac.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.600]   He's happy.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.160]   You totally opted into it.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.160]   Yep.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.920]   I really hope Chipotle comes on as a sponsor.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.920]   Seriously.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.000]   It got in so many previous.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.160]   The underwear or the month club after we plugged him here to come on.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:22.440]   Did you see I tweeted that yesterday and they had like 800 new subscribers.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.520]   The power of Leo.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.680]   I said, oh, my man packs is on the way now with free shave gel.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.400]   Um, you know, Jessica worked at an interview with business insider, which was very good
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.960]   where he talked about how one of the Facebook's core values is to move fast and break things.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.040]   Like he, and he said that, you know, he feels like, I'm actually, this is a good segue
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:48.480]   into some of the moves into Facebook, Google engineers, one in particular, my love, um,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:54.240]   that, you know, engineers at Facebook have the ability to make a big impact and are encouraged
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.200]   to deploy, push, iterate quickly and, and fail and fix.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.400]   And I feel like really that's what we beacon was.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.480]   It was a mistake and they fixed it, but move fast and break things.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.480]   I like that.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.200]   That's the, that's the, um, Web ethos.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.680]   And there's two things that Facebook really embodies of the Web ethos.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:16.800]   One is that push it out and iterate, uh, which is another way of saying, you know, get it
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.520]   out and break it and then do it again and break it and do it again until you get it
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.520]   right.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.440]   And the second one is don't worry about making money.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.880]   And I think this deals thing is very interesting that they're more interested in building the
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:30.240]   platform, building the audience and not monetizing it yet.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.440]   And this is how Facebook's operated all along.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:37.840]   And what I really like about deals is that there's an, you can, you can, uh, set up donations
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.200]   to charity too, which I really like that.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.400]   That kind of spoke to me.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.880]   That also softened me to Zuckerberg a little bit.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.840]   I was like, okay, this is interesting.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.200]   So they're creating a use case for donating to charity for checking in or for participating
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.200]   and interacting.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.200]   That's what he says.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   We're using as a platform for that.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.200]   Right.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.200]   That's just, what was this duty group on?
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.520]   Well, group on was there on stage.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:05.720]   They obviously welcome this and they're going to use the Facebook single sign sign on and
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.720]   they demonstrated, I think the, you know, look, this is what's happening.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:15.120]   You know, people who would normally be natural enemies like looped face, uh, four square,
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.440]   um, uh, go walla.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.600]   I have no choice but to join the party because it's either Facebook's going to push you out
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.520]   or you play in Facebook space.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.480]   That's what scares me a little bit about this is that this is, they're so powerful now with
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.040]   half a billion users.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.240]   Uh, they're, they're so almost unstoppable.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:39.240]   And so people who would normally say, no, we're going to compete now say, I can't compete.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:44.520]   So we're going to participate even if we end up getting engulfed and devoured, which
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.960]   I think a company like four square, what chant, what chance does four square have against
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.960]   places?
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.000]   Um, none.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.600]   So, so Facebook in a way is saying, you know, well, let you write to the API.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.600]   Come on.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.760]   We'll give you the single sign on and it'll be good for you.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.800]   And also just means a ton of data flows back to that.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   Right.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   I don't know.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   I love four square.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   I mean, the, the voting stuff that the four squared did this week was amazing.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   Wasn't it?
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.280]   Places is not as good as four square.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.200]   Uh, I do stuff with you.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.200]   You can do stuff with places.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.480]   For instance, this multi, multiple, multiple check in, which at first we thought that's
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.160]   just creepy where you could check other people into your place.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.480]   Um, now it makes sense with the deals thing because you can, you said, bring three friends
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.200]   and get a sandwich.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.880]   So I told, I told Dennis Crowley, when I saw him, I said, I said this on the show a while
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.960]   ago, I was, I want the prospective four square, which that starts to become.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960]   Right.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   Right.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.880]   Not, not where I am or where I was, where I'm going to be.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.760]   And let me use it as an organizing tool.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   And he said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.320]   You know, it's one of a hundred things they got to work on.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.880]   Well, and here's the beauty, frankly, of what Facebook's doing, Gina.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   You love four square.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.880]   Fine.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.880]   Keep using it.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.480]   You're just, but it's now in the Facebook universe, but I can choose to have pipe into,
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.160]   into, into Facebook, which I do actually do a little bit.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.120]   But this will be even more intimate because right now you do it as an application, which
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.520]   I do too, as an apple, I use four square.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.560]   I don't use places as an application, but now it's going to update your Facebook location.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:11.440]   It's going to add, you know, all of a sudden it'll have more and more Facebook in it.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.920]   Facebook gets the benefit of seeing all this data across its servers.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:21.280]   I have a feeling that it's not even, it doesn't even have to be maligned.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.080]   It doesn't even have to be like Microsoft did.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.080]   Come here.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   Let's see what you got.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.760]   Oh, that's nice, but we're not going to buy you.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.160]   We're just going to copy you.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.920]   It doesn't even have to be like that anymore.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:35.120]   Facebook's completely content to have four square be a satellite and continue indefinitely.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.320]   You want to use four square and please be our guest, Gina?
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.200]   Well, that's the other, that's the other thing you're saying about, about the ethos of the
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.600]   web, you know, Google wants you to succeed with your blog.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   Right.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.600]   It's the same idea.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.600]   It is a form.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   You're right.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.600]   It's the same idea.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:54.880]   So opting into the possibility of seeing Jeff at Chipotle, but what else am I off to?
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.800]   You know what I'm being like, where, what else?
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.520]   So I get my friends at the bar, but like what else happens then later?
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.920]   In 2013, when you know that I was somewhere in 2010, like what does that mean?
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.920]   When Facebook has all that data.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.560]   The health insurance company says your cardiac was caused by all that guacamole, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.520]   We certainly can think of a lot of bad things.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.080]   Can we think of some benefits?
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.360]   You have a, you know what's interesting?
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:22.840]   Remember Gordon, Gordon Bell and his book about, you know, he was wearing a camera.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:27.760]   I still may still be around his neck at Microsoft researcher, guy who found a digital equipment.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.480]   And he was wearing camera on his neck that took a picture every 10 seconds.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.200]   And his, he said, eventually my whole life will be recorded and you'll be able to search
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   this step.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   Oh, you don't need a camera anymore.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.200]   You just need Facebook.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.720]   I mean, I was fascinated by that project.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.920]   I have a terrible memory.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.680]   I forget conversations that I have with people.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.840]   You know, I lost my dad really young and I think about him a lot.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.200]   I try to remember things I talked to him about.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.400]   And I think, you know, what if I had had a camera, you know, on me the whole time I'd
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.240]   had him or like, if I could, if I could search all the conversations I've had in my life,
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.200]   like if I could see recurring themes and sentiments.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.000]   I mean, this is kind of what I'm doing with ThinkUp.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.760]   I think there's a lot of important things happening.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.400]   The conversations that we have, you know, my Gmail archive the last five years is kind
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   of gold.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.480]   I search Gmail all the time for some email about this, that or the other thing.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.920]   So I think that's really valuable.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.640]   I just really like having control of that stuff and having it on my hard drive and my computer
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.400]   and me collecting it, you know, my wear versus spy wear.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.720]   I think Cory Doctorow calls it just freaks me out that Facebook has, you know, all that
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.240]   information on their servers.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.840]   And I guess I could say the same thing about Google.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.880]   The difference is that I don't just trust Facebook as much as I trust Google.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.880]   But you know what?
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.800]   Your credit card company knows more about you than anybody.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   That's true.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.800]   That's true.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   That's absolutely true, Jeff.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.720]   And at least, at least Facebook, I'm worried about Facebook because they're transparent
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.720]   about what they know.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.520]   I don't think about the credit card company, right?
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.880]   It's the people you're absolutely right.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.600]   The people have information that we aren't telling you.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.920]   I mean, easy pass knows when I go through the toll.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:49.040]   I mean, you know, people don't we want though, ultimately, wouldn't it be awesome to have
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.560]   to, it's this Mark Zuckerberg saying nobody wants to make lists, but everybody wants the
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.640]   benefit of it.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:42:01.360]   So if you have automated systems that gather, correlate, curate all of the information in
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.000]   your life, isn't that priority inbox?
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Right?
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Yes.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   That's the first piece of it.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   It's a tiny piece of it.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.040]   What you do and it's coming all kinds of signals and will be no problem at all to put
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.320]   into priority inbox than other feeds, which is Marissa's, I haven't said this a month,
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.840]   so I'm going to say it again, hyper personal news stream.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.840]   Yep.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.120]   Whatever happened to the hyper personal news stream?
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.640]   It's the hyper personal life stream.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   It's everything.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   Yes.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   Yes.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.640]   Let's take a break.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.760]   The values we need, I was at this thing today with the, the postal department trying
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.120]   to rethink what their life is for isn't.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.080]   And as we were going through various, you know, functions that you need, prioritization
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:47.400]   and filtering, you know, kind of, which is the equivalent of aggregating and curating,
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.480]   it becomes very important because of very high value.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.640]   I think we were in a very interesting territory.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   Very interesting territory.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.640]   Let's take a break.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.640]   I want to come back with more.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.280]   We will talk about those transitions.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.240]   Google bleeding some very good engineers to Facebook.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.800]   And maybe you could see a little bit about what's going on.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.280]   People are saying, isn't this a show about Google?
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.960]   I really should say this week in the cloud, we were going to call it that, but we thought
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.920]   it'd be people be more compelled if we're Google.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.440]   But the truth is it's cloud.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:21.440]   And what Facebook's doing, what Google's doing, it's all, it's all about what's happening.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.440]   And I think it's all related.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.160]   It's very interesting.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.520]   Before we go on, though, I would like to mention our friends at Citrix and go to meeting.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.000]   A great way to use the cloud for your meetings.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.920]   You know, traveling to a meeting is a pain in the behind, not to mention expensive and
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.920]   stressful.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:45.600]   And in fact, a lot of people say, well, you got to meet face to face to get business done.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.160]   I think you can do very well with go to meeting.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.840]   A lot of people are replacing face to face meetings with conference calls, but that's,
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.280]   you know, boy, it's not visual.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   It's very, can be very dull.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.240]   And you also kind of feel like you're losing your attendees a lot of times.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.080]   You could tell they're off answering email or something.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.720]   This is where go to meeting really comes in.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.720]   You could do it ahead of time.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.240]   It integrates with your email package.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.160]   You just say, send an invitation.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.280]   It sends out the information with a link and all they need to know to join your meeting.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.040]   By the way, includes a free voice over the internet and phone teleconferencing.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.360]   So that's kind of built into go to meeting.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.880]   Or you can even while you're on a conference call with one or 15 people, you could say,
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.600]   I got to show you something here.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.840]   Go to go to meeting.com.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.040]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.320]   Now, even if they've never used go to meeting before, if they've never installed the software
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:33.040]   before 30 seconds later, they're seeing your computer on their screen.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.680]   PC or Mac, it's completely cross platform.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.240]   You can show them the keynote or the PowerPoint.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.560]   You can show them the websites.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.560]   It's great for training.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.240]   It's great for collaboration.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.960]   Of course for sales.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:47.200]   It really is a breakthrough product because it took, you know, what we many companies do
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:52.360]   which is, you know, kind of remote access and online meetings and made it simple, clean
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.840]   and elegant.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.360]   So it just gets the job done.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.560]   I want you to try it free.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.560]   You don't have to believe me.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.080]   Just try it free for 30 days.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:03.800]   If you go to go to meeting.com/twig, before I'm done talking, you'll have it installed.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.800]   I mean, it's really that quick.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.320]   You just go to meeting.com/twig, click, click, click, and then you're in.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.320]   And now you've got it.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.200]   And the next time you're on a conference call, just put a post a note on your screen
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.840]   saying don't forget to use go to meeting.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.080]   Try it.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.840]   You'll see your attendees will like it.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.840]   It's easy to use.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.320]   At just $49 a month, it's really affordable.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.320]   I want you to try it absolutely free for 30 days.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.640]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:32.720]   We thank the folks at Citrix for their continued long time support of the entire network and
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.720]   this week in Google.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.880]   So Gina, you said you knew some of these people who've transitioned out from Google?
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:43.880]   Well, I was talking about Lars Rasmussen who actually he wrote the forward to my book on
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:44.880]   wave.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.360]   He's a web hero.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.200]   He's somewhat he's an unsung web hero, but he's certainly one of my heroes.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.920]   He's the guy with his brother, Jen, who kind of saved us from the crappiness that was map
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:59.240]   quest and launched Google Maps and showed us what JavaScript and Ajax could do in a browser.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.720]   And he was the creator of wave.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:05.760]   And so he announced this week that he is moving to Facebook.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.600]   He announced it on Facebook.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.840]   He announced it on Facebook.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.040]   And it was pretty surprising to me.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.200]   And he said he was pretty frank.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.080]   I met him at Google I/O.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.080]   He's an interesting guy.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:18.480]   And he said that getting things done at Google is really hard.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.000]   It's a huge organization.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.560]   And the wave experience was difficult for him and frustrating.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.800]   He's a really smart guy.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.320]   And I think he felt like he couldn't see his vision to fruition.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:34.280]   In fact, Marissa Meyer said this week on dig dialogue, actually, that the wave is one
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.960]   of three mistakes she feels like Google made.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.960]   So that was interesting.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   Wow.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.960]   Anyway, you know, look at that.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.960]   That's to the heart.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:42.960]   Is that mistaken?
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.320]   And they were launching it, how they launched it, what they did with it, were killing it.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.320]   I mean, what was the mistake?
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.760]   All she said was we would have done it differently.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:57.120]   So, you know, Zuckerberg courted Lars personally and said to him, hey, you know what, we're
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.120]   a small company.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.680]   You can come in, have huge impact.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:03.520]   His job description is like, come into Facebook and hang out and see what happens.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.840]   It's the equivalent of Steve Jobs saying to John Scully, you don't want to make sugar
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.800]   water any for the rest of your life, do you?
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.800]   Right.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.600]   I mean, it really is that kind of a pitch, isn't it?
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.080]   So Lars is moving from Sydney to San Francisco to take this job.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.080]   Really?
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.360]   Which also surprised me because he faced the wave team out of Sydney to work for Google.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:26.040]   So it must be, it sounds like it's a very financially compelling offer from Facebook,
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:31.720]   but also it really made me go like, you know, wow, I'm surprised.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.560]   Is Jan Sowin-Hans going to?
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:34.560]   I don't think so.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.920]   I think it's just Lars right now.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.920]   There was no mention of Jens.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.920]   I wondered about that.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   His brother, who...
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.640]   It's impressive how he's hiring the best talent.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.920]   He also got Sam Lesson this week buying Drop I/O that he's telling him, "A porta hell out
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.220]   of me, yeah."
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.220]   But Sam's great.
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.880]   I'm happy for Sam, but that pisses me off.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:58.880]   And I can't think of another service that's instant, 100 megs, password protected, open.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:04.120]   I mean, I tried my best on Life Hacker, but I still can't even quite find the exact same
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.680]   service.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.000]   I was really disappointed.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.800]   I used Drop I/O, recommended Drop I/O all the time.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.600]   But I think the world is Sam and I'm happy for him.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.520]   You know, as Zach said at one point in an interview, this is another case of it, he says,
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.720]   "We don't buy companies for the intellectual property or the assets.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.720]   We buy it for the engineering."
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.720]   Right.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.560]   But he paid off the investors.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560]   It's reported.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.080]   So getting less than cost a lot of money.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:29.120]   And getting Lars is an incredible get.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:33.600]   And you hire someone with that much talent and that much vision, and you entice them with
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.240]   that much freedom.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.120]   Great things have to happen.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.120]   Yes.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.120]   Let's hope.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.120]   But yeah.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:46.360]   By the way, I am going to have my suggestion for a Drop I/O replacement as my pick of the
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.360]   week.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.520]   But it's not quite the same, but I'll be curious what you think.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.920]   You probably know about it, Kevin, but I'm going to mention it.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.720]   So Sam Lesson is a great acquisition.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.720]   Lars is a great acquisition.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.040]   What it really does look like is that Facebook doesn't have an agenda with these.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.360]   It's not like they're saying, "Oh, we're going to build something like Drop I/O," or,
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.680]   "Oh, we're going to build something like Wave or Maps."
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.360]   They just want the best minds.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.720]   Zuckerberg or Russ Musson was quoted as saying, "I don't remember which way it went, but I
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.200]   think either one of them quoted as Zuckerberg as saying, "Why don't you come here and hang
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.360]   out for a few years and see what happens?"
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.360]   Right.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.120]   I mean, he's basically saying, "We've got this many users.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.640]   We've got our tendrils and all these different aspects of the web.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.000]   You will have really high impact.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   We do."
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   That's the pitch.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.200]   Every individual engineer can get a lot done there.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.200]   That's always the pitch.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.600]   And that's what engineers like.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:38.240]   Admittedly, with Facebook pre-IPO and the potential of cash in on millions of dollars,
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.240]   that might have something to do with it.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:44.000]   But I have a feeling people like Lars, "Well, I'm sure enough Google stock to be comfortable."
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.120]   It's not the money that motivates them.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:50.000]   Even said they're in the mobile announcement today, he made a point of saying that we're
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   a small...
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   He said it several times.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   And then he got it all...
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   Yeah, in a point of saying that.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.200]   He said, "Everybody stand up who was involved in this."
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.280]   And then he said, "Again to the journalists, see we're a small team."
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.120]   What is that all about, Kevin?
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.880]   He sounded like a selling point.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:09.200]   Maybe he's hunting for more people, but also it's appealing to think that...
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.320]   Because you don't think of small groups as being scheming.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.560]   You don't think of small groups as being...
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:21.360]   Unless they're playing to bomb something, it's hard to think of a small group of guys
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:26.800]   hanging out together late night, mounting to ruining your life somehow with privacy issues.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.800]   Or anything else.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.240]   I think it's even more than that.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.720]   It's exactly against Google.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   Exactly what Lars said.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.720]   You can't get things done.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.720]   Google will look.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.600]   You put us all together, look what they built.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:36.600]   Hello.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.200]   And it's his best competitive...
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.440]   If he's going to be built on talent, that was his best competitive shot at Google.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.440]   Interesting.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.600]   I also got the sense he said it with pride.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.840]   See what we've done and it's just a couple of us.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.000]   Yeah, he does that thing where he's like, "Well, the first iteration of Facebook was
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   built in two weeks."
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   You know, just a little bit of the arrogance.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.640]   Like, "Oh, look at how much we've done with just a couple of...
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.640]   You know, we just take that...
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.640]   I am powerful."
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   ...we just take that...
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.640]   ...about a couple of years we'll be again.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   So, you know, so there's that.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.360]   He's got every right to be proud of that.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.360]   I think that's...
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.360]   He does.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.360]   He does.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.360]   He was a huge accomplishment.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:15.360]   But, yes, you know, I think it was Omalaik wrote this post, "Google's real problem getting
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.360]   things done."
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   And it just talked about...
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:22.040]   And actually quoted Lars saying that, you know, some of the problem, the reason why Google
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:26.880]   is losing engineers to Facebook is that it's, you know, it's a slow moving...
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.440]   You know, it's hard to get your product to bubble up.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.440]   There's just a huge company.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.600]   It's hard to get things done and feel like you're having a big impact.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.880]   And it kind of goes back to like Doug Bowman's post about how, you know, he would have to
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:41.960]   make his case for three pixels, three pixels or four pixel border designer.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:42.960]   Right.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.200]   So, kind of a similar thing.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.440]   It's like, you know, I don't have to present data to tell you whether or not I think it
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.040]   should have one more pixel, that kind of thing.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.000]   So, maybe I should just slow down.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   We talked a little bit about this on Macbreak because we were talking about Apple who was
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.680]   acquired a number of companies like La La or done things like Mobile Media.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.120]   They've never transformed into viable products.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.800]   Google, you can point at a lot of products like Dodgeball that just died on the vine
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.400]   and Google Wave.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.440]   And I was wondering, is this endemic in Silicon Valley that you just throw a lot of stuff
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.240]   on the wall and some of it sticks and some of it doesn't?
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:19.880]   Or is it really some sort of flaw in these big teams that they sometimes can't execute?
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.840]   They can't bring a product...
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.040]   Well, isn't it both Leo?
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:31.840]   If you don't see ahead what support it needs, I mean, I'm sure Gina will agree with this,
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:38.880]   the tragedy of Wave was that it was orphaned very soon.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:39.880]   Right.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:40.880]   Too soon.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:44.960]   And I really had the chance to really find what it was.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.800]   Fourth Mark Zuckerberg, we don't know what it is yet.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.560]   Wave Shores, hell, didn't know what it was yet.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.120]   Yeah, you can't go on with huge losses on things.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:59.440]   I just see right now this minute, by the way, that Chase Carey, the head of News Corp, says
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:03.280]   that the losses at MySpace are unacceptable and unsustainable.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   Uh-oh.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.200]   Feels like the hands getting near the plug, man.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.000]   Didn't they just do a relaunch and redesign?
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   Yep.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.080]   Yeah, so we were very excited all that, but paid content said this.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.280]   So yeah, there's a limit to this.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:22.960]   But if Buzz didn't have the kind of support to think A and B and Android and Chrome aren't
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:29.560]   thought together, and I love Google, but this, Eric has always said that their biggest challenge
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:34.000]   is being as big as they are, and it really is true and home to roost.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.400]   Yep.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:42.360]   You always want to think that these big companies could never, they're strategic people.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:46.360]   If folks at the top have gotten there by being smart and then you find out that AOL Time
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:49.640]   Warner was literally like a toppist dinner that just went on too long.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.760]   I'm making this stuff up as they go along.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.760]   I know, really.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.320]   It was really like a dinner they had together, and then the next day they call each other
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.120]   on the phone like after a date or something like, "Yeah."
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.120]   Well, it's just fair.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.120]   You're right.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   And that's how Murdoch bought MySpace.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.120]   Oh boy.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.320]   You want to assume about these copies?
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.480]   I need to go to Chipotle more often.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.480]   No.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.480]   Where's Kevin?
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.200]   He sounds like he's dying.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.680]   You start on Kevin?
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:19.880]   Well, a little bit, but no, I just feel bad for your business department.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:24.240]   Who knows who you might be.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.440]   At some point a company as big as Google with DeepPockets becomes kind of like a startup
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.360]   incubator, but within it, from within, right?
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.200]   So like the wave team, from what I understand, was sort of treated like a startup that was
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.200]   kind of the start of the problem.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   Yeah, they were in Australia.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.200]   They were in Australia, right.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.200]   And it was like, they had certain goals to me.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.720]   Google was going to invest this much, you know, this much staff and money into the development
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.720]   of this product.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:47.560]   If it didn't reach its goals by year one or year two, then they would cut it off.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.400]   And you know, if the wave team had been a startup on their own, would they have made
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   it?
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.400]   I don't know.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:57.480]   But part of it, you know, I think is that kind of that small startup from within the
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.320]   big company kind of take on things, but it does change things.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:05.360]   You know, wave had a million active users because they were a Google product.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.180]   But if they were a startup on their own and had a million active users, they would absolutely
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:09.880]   be considered a success.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.880]   Right.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   Let's take a break.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.800]   We have lots more to talk about, including some very good numbers for the Android marketplace,
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.800]   a lawsuit.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.840]   Google's decided to take on the Department of the Interior.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.840]   We'll find out why.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:26.240]   And yes, you may be getting a very big check from Google Buzz.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.240]   No.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   Oh, nice.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.440]   That's a great tweet.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.240]   If I've got this correct, I should be getting $10 million from Google Buzz.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.400]   No, no, no.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.960]   We'll talk about that in just a second right now, though.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:42.940]   I want to talk about our friends at the fine mighty Ford plant who have created the incredible
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:48.620]   Ford sink every time I drive my, my Mustang around and I'm listening to my audio books.
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:52.900]   And then I just, then a text message comes in in my Android phone and I hear it read
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:57.180]   to me over the sink or, you know, I get lost and I say, sink, tell me where I am and how
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.300]   to get to where I'm going.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.260]   I just think, thank my lucky stars.
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:01.260]   Fun.
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:02.260]   Somebody finally got this thing right.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:05.300]   I have driven plenty of cars that you try to talk to.
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.600]   None of them feels like kit and night rider.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.600]   My Mustang does.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:09.600]   It's amazing.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.680]   I understand everything I'm saying.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.240]   Ford sink is true hands free calling.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:17.080]   You press a button on your steering wheel, you say phone, you say a call, Gina, Trapani
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.880]   at work and boom, it just does it.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:19.880]   It's amazing.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.580]   It's also turned by turn directions.
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:26.600]   Even if you don't buy the full GPS package, all Ford sink vehicles have GPS in them and
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:31.040]   can walk and can tell you turn by turn without a big display, but they tell you to turn
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.040]   how to go.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.520]   They even know what your route is and they'll warn you about traffic problems ahead.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.840]   They'll even reroute you if you need it.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.180]   They also have 911 assist.
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:42.180]   Now this is optional, but you could turn it off or on.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:45.420]   But I always turn it on on all my phones because when I get in the car, it automatically
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.420]   pairs up.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:52.220]   Now if something bad happens and my airbags get deployed, the Ford sink calls 911, gives
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:57.060]   it my GPS coordinates because it knows exactly where I am, plays a recorded message and turns
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:00.780]   on my phone and microphone and says, "You got anything you want to tell them?"
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.340]   "I'm okay."
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.100]   And sink is fantastic.
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:09.160]   It's available exclusively on Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.540]   If you haven't tried it, there's a couple of things you could do.
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:14.260]   You could go to the website, sinkmyridepodcast.com.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:18.300]   Some great videos and demos there, but really there's nothing like trying it in person and
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:21.260]   seeing how smart it is about recognizing your voice, all the things you can do.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:24.940]   You know, you can press the button and say it goes, "Dong," and you say, "Climate."
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:26.940]   Set temperature 74 degrees and it does it.
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:28.620]   I mean, it's just, it's kind of spooky.
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:31.720]   It's like your car understands you.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.240]   You sink.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:37.260]   Go get it today at your local Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicle and believe me, if you're
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:41.820]   test driving cars, you're in the market for a car, try all the other guys.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:46.420]   You know, we have some other manufacturers cars and I just, you know, you'll see immediately
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:48.380]   how much better the sink is.
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:49.700]   Sinkmyridepodcast.com.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.260]   We're thanking for their support.
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:57.900]   Android phones this past quarter, 44% of all smartphones sold in the U.S.
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:03.560]   The headlines and most newspapers were Apple Beats Rim with 26%.
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:05.400]   Not many papers said on all, by the way.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.480]   Yeah, the iPhone was 26%.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:10.920]   Android was 44%.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:16.120]   Although I have to say in Apple's defense, Apple's iPhone was the number one selling
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.480]   handset.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:22.280]   So if you take any one Android handset and compare it to the iPhone, iPhone wins, but
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:29.780]   it's just because there's 20 plus Android headsets, headsets that 44% is amazing.
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:30.780]   It is.
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:31.780]   And more devices come in.
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.700]   Say again, more devices come in.
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:36.420]   What do we think about this Nexus 2?
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.420]   Is that real?
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:39.900]   Yeah, I think it is Samsung has a big event.
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:41.900]   When is that event, Eileen?
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:42.900]   November 8th.
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.260]   So a couple of days, five days.
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.260]   I suspect.
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.260]   It doesn't.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.260]   I don't think the Nexus 2 is going to be.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:52.140]   I mean, just from what I've read it, it sounds like it's just kind of the next developer
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:54.080]   slash early adopter handset.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:58.920]   And they're obviously not going to be doing the same kind of carrier independent launch.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.080]   Like they did with the Nexus 1.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:02.320]   Yeah, I mean, Nexus 1 was HTC.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.040]   It was sold by Google.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.040]   Who's going to sell the Nexus 2 Google?
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:12.560]   Yeah, Gizmodo had someone who kind of sources like a friend of theirs, got a hold of it and
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.800]   gave them their report.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:17.320]   And so it was basically like a Galaxy S with some nice features.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.320]   That's what it was like.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.320]   It's on the front facing camera.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.140]   It's more styling maybe, but it seems like it's really just going to be kind of the phone
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:29.380]   for people like me, people like developers who want to have the stock Android right away.
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:33.420]   And you know, but still it's kind of neat that they're at the point now where there are
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:36.500]   so many good phone, so many good Android phones out there that they don't need to come out
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:41.500]   with the Nexus 1 and say like this, this is your paradigm.
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:42.500]   Like you know, it's kind of nice.
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.300]   At the same time, I want that like, you know, pure Google phone.
[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:49.500]   I love my Nexus 1 because I have that.
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:50.500]   I like that.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.500]   I don't like the add-ons.
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.500]   I really don't.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.940]   And it's nice to have the pure experience, at least to experience it.
[00:59:54.940 --> 01:00:00.300]   Now the most interesting product rumor came from Digitimes, the Taiwanese electronics
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:07.980]   paper that said Google Chrome devices, not Android devices, but Chrome operating system
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.840]   devices may be out later this year.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.360]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.360]   You like that?
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360]   You're looking for that?
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.520]   I want that as much as I want a burrito.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:19.220]   I have to say, I am after, you know, and I'm supposedly going to get a review unit of the
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.780]   Galaxy S tab.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:21.780]   Ooh.
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.180]   And what I do will talk about it.
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:30.240]   But I'm gathering that because, you know, Google itself says don't use 2.2.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.840]   Don't use Froyo on a tablet.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.800]   The apps are not optimized for the screen size.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.720]   I'm having a feeling that that's not going to be an ideal experience.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.720]   Ooh.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.720]   The opposite.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.560]   Speaking of ideal experiences, go ahead, Jen.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:47.360]   No, I was going to say, you know, the seven inch, the small, smallness of it.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.120]   Whereas a Chrome device, maybe that's what we want.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.520]   It'll be built around an ARM processor manufactured by Inventech.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.320]   This is all from Digitize launching this month.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:04.800]   And Digitize says Google also plans to launch its own brand Google Chrome netbook.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.480]   They did say didn't, didn't they say didn't Eric say we're going to do one?
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.480]   I think he did.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:15.440]   Leo, I have to ask you, you said that the new MacBook Air made you use your iPad less,
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.440]   right?
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.440]   Yeah, this is sweet.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.440]   Okay.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.080]   So now do you feel the same way about, so to that I thought, well, yeah, I mean, I use
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.440]   my netbook more too because it's got a keyboard.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.560]   It's a real keyboard and you can create and do things.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.680]   So do you feel similarly about Chrome OS based netbook?
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.360]   Well, I think for me, now this is very personal.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.600]   So everybody's going to have a different opinion.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:38.840]   I think for me, the key to the iPad was form the weight, you know, size, weight and battery
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840]   life.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.120]   This is very close as size and weight.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.000]   Battery life is five, not 10 hours, but I'm talking about the MacBook Air, but it's good
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.680]   enough that I find I use this more.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.880]   And for the things that I do, like blogging, bookmarking stories, you know, Google Reader,
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:58.800]   it's I think a better, frankly, better tool for especially if you're doing any content
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.600]   creation, even light duty content creation.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.000]   I think that the iPad is not really ideal for that.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   It's great.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.240]   You're just saying all of us to make me feel good.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.440]   Did you buy an air or you know, you sent back the iPad?
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.440]   I was up at the iPad.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.440]   Yeah, I'm held out too.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:15.640]   You know, I mean, Jobs himself kind of admitted that the touch interface isn't ideal, you
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:19.880]   know, down, you know, up, you know, just vertically versus horizontally.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.360]   And that's why you don't want to reach out and do touch.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.360]   Right.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:24.360]   Right.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.360]   But the iPad is unless it's in your lap and your knees are up.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.880]   Anyway, this is this is a conversation everyone's had a million times already, but I was curious
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.400]   to know I kind of lost interest in the Chrome OS a little bit because I said, you know,
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.080]   I just really want a good Android tablet.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.080]   And I'm good.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.080]   You know, I've got an netbook.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.760]   But you know, my netbooks go a little slow.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.040]   I might be interested in checking out Chrome OS.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.480]   I mean, it's an expensive netbook.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.120]   This is the Macbook air.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.440]   And I think Chrome OS, Chromium OS, Chrome OS would be interesting.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.280]   Now the thing that this digitized implies is that Google is going to do this kind of
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.200]   Nexus one strategy only with a netbook or a Chromium notebook.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.200]   I'll buy one.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.360]   I hope they have some good hardware engineers working on it.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.840]   So really smart designers.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.240]   Oh, yes, you're right.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.240]   They're right.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.480]   They have a spec cell for already.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:18.840]   Don't they come for the tablet or for the digit time says instant on long lasting battery.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:24.440]   Also HP and Acer will have units based on Chrome OS by December.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:29.760]   Okay, but going to Kevin's point about about kind of better be good hardware.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.480]   Maybe other good things.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.480]   Google TV.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480]   Did you install it?
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.720]   Oh, I can give you my review.
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.720]   It was good.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:37.720]   Nothing's wrong with the hardware.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:43.000]   It's a little weird to have your remote control be a keyboard.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.720]   But on the bright side, it's pretty usable.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.360]   I think it's way over complicated.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:55.200]   It doesn't give you enough value really to justify either the cost or the complexity.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.600]   I mean, you know, it did an update before you can install it's a half hour update.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.800]   And then just last night I'm watching TV.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.880]   It's a good thing it was in the world series.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.880]   I'm watching TV.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:11.760]   It pops up a big thing on my screen saying I'd like to update myself now if you do it.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:16.000]   In its defense, you could say no, do it later, but it's like annoying.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.800]   I know it happened in green.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   Yeah, I would have been infuriated.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.640]   Get out of my way.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.040]   Where's the keyboard?
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.040]   Mod.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.040]   Interrupting my queen.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:30.360]   It has problems with HD has problems with Dolby audio.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.400]   You know, for me, I haven't had those problems.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.000]   Although occasionally I get a weird HD effect where it feels like it's delayed or the frame
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.040]   rate is low.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.560]   And there's not a lot of functionality.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.440]   The Netflix that's in there is not the current version of Netflix for the previous version.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.200]   So both Roku and Apple TV have a much more advanced Netflix version in which you can
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.880]   subscribe to movies within it.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.960]   You can't do that on the Logitech review.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:55.120]   The apps that are there are very scant and there's no marketplace yet.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:58.680]   Now, if you add the Android market and down the road, I start seeing a lot of apps for
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:59.680]   this thing.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.640]   I'm going to change my tune perhaps.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.600]   But right now, there's nothing compelling about it.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.360]   It can't do really much of as much as say the $99 Roku box.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.920]   And it's a lot more complicated to set up and use.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:11.920]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:12.920]   Wait, wait.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.920]   Wait for Rev 2.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.920]   Wait for Rev 2.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.560]   Wait for the market Android market.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.720]   You know, this is early days.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.720]   Absolutely.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.280]   Don't buy the G1 of TVs.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.280]   It is the G1.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.280]   Very good.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.280]   That's a good one.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.280]   Very good.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.480]   That's exactly what it is.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.480]   And I have this.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.240]   Some high hopes that I had for the G1 and the same disappointment when I started using
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.240]   it.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.240]   That's a very apt analogy.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.480]   You're on fire, Nick.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.640]   We're on fire.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.640]   I try.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.080]   And you know, it's interesting because there's some real Google is starting to get advocates
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.560]   in the same way that Apple has advocates.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:48.760]   There's some real Google advocates who kind of were mad at me that I didn't like Google
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:49.760]   TV.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.320]   I said, well, I just have to say, I just, this is my experience.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.720]   The reviews were awful.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.120]   How's the search interface?
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.680]   That's like the saving grace.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.680]   I've pretty much, you know, grabbed from all the reviews I've read.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.680]   All the points.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.480]   But I don't want to, I don't really.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.800]   I don't want to search for shows that often.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.520]   I kind of know where the stuff I want to see is.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.680]   Don't you?
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.680]   That's not a good sign.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:18.480]   Now, I mean, like there's an Android app and in the Android now as a remote control
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:21.520]   that works with my TV, it's a little weird, but it does work.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.640]   I was explaining to a friend and he said that it would be the weirdest, it would be
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.320]   the greatest interface for your weird friends.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.880]   We're like, I wonder if there's anything with Willem to flow on it four PM Sunday.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.880]   Like in that.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.200]   So there you go.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.760]   But who does that?
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.920]   Exactly.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.440]   I just think it's not quite ready.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.400]   And things like, you know, somebody, somebody I saw a picture on Twitter, oh, this is really
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:45.280]   cool live TV and Twitter just as it's supposed to be, except that the live TV is this little
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.080]   tiny picture in picture and the Twitter is the whole screen.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.720]   You cannot resize the TV and downsize the Twitter.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.280]   The Twitter is the whole thing.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   It's little things like that.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.200]   You know, I have difficulty in man.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.520]   I think everybody there's this holy grail of getting everything on the TV.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:05.040]   I can't imagine maybe I'm just because I'm getting old.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.080]   I can't imagine many apps that would really be great for a TV.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:14.160]   Well Pandora's there, which is not TV app, but I mean, at least you can listen to your
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.160]   music.
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.120]   Hulu would have been nice had Hulu allowed it.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   ABC and TV.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.120]   Right.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.120]   I'd like a little anchor thing.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.440]   Okay, I'll tell you one.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.440]   Angry Birds.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:29.240]   I can get a full screen, six inch angry birds.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.400]   So gaming could be really awesome on this thing.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:32.400]   Okay, that's it.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.400]   Yep, you won.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.400]   Yeah, anger boards.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.640]   I would like a ticker tape of either all the tweets that mentioned Glee or just my friends
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:43.360]   tweets that mentioned Glee just kind of streaming along the bottom while I watch Glee like that.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.200]   Not enough to get in the way of the show, but enough for me to laugh at a joke that somebody
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.200]   cracked.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.200]   That's very good.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.200]   And then during the World Series game.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.200]   That's an easy thing to implement, but they haven't implemented it yet.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.600]   That would be, that's exactly what I would like.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.560]   I don't want to see the big Twitter and the little TV.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.960]   I want the big TV, little crawl of Twitter.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:00.960]   That'd be awesome.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.920]   Maybe I could click and reply a little bit like, I want to say, I want to Facebook place
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.520]   this stream so I can feel bad about how active all my friends are while I'm sitting at home
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.520]   watching TV.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:14.360]   My friends are outside and I'm watching the wire again.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.360]   No less the wire.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:19.040]   You know perfectly well all your friends are also watching the wire.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.040]   So it'd be kind of fun.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.000]   You could all say we're, you know, couch potatoes together.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   Indeed.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.280]   We could all check in at the wire.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.240]   The potentials there, I think that's really apt.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.200]   It's the G1 and I'm willing to, I'm willing to stipulate that, you know, the next generation
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.560]   might be well worth getting, but don't, but save your money on the two 99 logic tech
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.560]   review.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.480]   That's a lot of money for something that's not very, get a $99 Roku box.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.040]   The Roku box is great.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040]   It's fantastic.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.040]   And it works and we're on it.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.040]   Actually, we're on this too.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.200]   You can get it, but you know, you browse through the podcast and all that stuff.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.200]   You can get that.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:54.320]   So Google's lobbyists apparently now this comes from Breitbart.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:57.760]   So take it with a grain of salt.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:03.480]   I don't usually quote Andrew Breitbart, but he, I mean, I think the facts are there.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:06.800]   It's his interpretation I might disagree with yesterday.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:11.320]   Of course, a couple of days ago, the FTC decided to close its investigation into the Google
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.920]   Wi-Fi incident.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:20.720]   Breitbart writer Ken Bain points out that this came one week after Obama attended a $30,000
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.000]   of a plate fundraiser at Marissa Myers house.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:34.400]   Also Becky Burr, Google lobbyist at Wilmer Hale on September 28th emailed White House
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:40.200]   officials asking for a meeting, asking the White House to assist in getting the FTC to
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.640]   back off the investigation.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.960]   So White House, I mean, that's what your higher lobbyists to do, right?
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:54.240]   And I think the reason that I don't, I mean, I think the facts are probably fine.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.560]   I think we all agree that the Wi-Fi thing really is bogus.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.040]   And so the FTC should have dropped it.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.440]   So I can't go ahead up about the lobbying on it.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.360]   Yesterday, Google Street View went up in Germany, the first bits of it.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.320]   And I went berserk because it was just, I wrote a piece that got translated into German
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.720]   on this asking, you know, Germany, what have you done?
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.560]   If you look at the pages, it's like pixel bombs.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.160]   They bomb their buildings digitally.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.260]   It's stupid.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.260]   It's offensive.
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.260]   It really is.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.260]   And it's a diminishment of what's public.
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.960]   I'm not going to go off and roll my Jarvis Rance right now, but it's just ridiculous.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.320]   And the German people are all bad at me.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.320]   It's not all the Germans.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:35.920]   We had a guy on that at night yesterday who was an artist, a really interesting artist
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:42.480]   as installations and his artistic collective, F.A.T. in Berlin built a fake Google Street
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.040]   View car to drive people crazy.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.200]   It's just got a cardboard thing.
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.000]   And they 12 around, you know, looking.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.320]   Because they thought it was so stupid that Germans were so worried about this.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:58.320]   The hashtag for this is now called Blurmany.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.320]   Blurmany.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   Oh, Blur.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.320]   And you blur the...
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.760]   Blurman, somebody put up a blur German flag.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.760]   Blurmany.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.560]   Let's see.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.640]   Google Buzz Settlement.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.200]   We're rich.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.200]   Not.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.200]   Not.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:22.400]   So the settlement got preliminary approval class action lawsuit by Gmail users over privacy
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.000]   violations when Buzz launched.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   We all remember that.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.360]   The settlement calls for Google to pay $8.5 million, but not to you, not to me, but toward a
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.560]   fund for organizations focusing on internet privacy policy or education.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.120]   Google said, "We're satisfied with your argument.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.480]   Glad to move forward."
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.320]   Preliminary approval.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.360]   And you can opt out of the settlement if you're a Gmail user, right?
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.360]   But then...
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.360]   Then you get nothing.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.320]   Then you have to file another lawsuit, win that in order to get anything other.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   Right.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   Privately.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.600]   How weird was it to get your second email ever from Gmail?
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.480]   The first one was like, "Gmail's different.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.600]   Here's how when you sign up.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.200]   And now this is the second time.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:04.960]   I really can't think of another time they've emailed every Gmail user and said, "Hey, by
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:05.960]   the way."
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:06.960]   You get nothing.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.960]   You just assumed right off the bat that it was bad.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   Yeah, right.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.960]   What are they mailing me for?
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.880]   Hey, one more Google transition.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:21.040]   YouTube CEO and founder is stepping down from Google.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:25.720]   I don't know if he's taking a new job or what?
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.720]   Chad Hurley.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.720]   Chad Hurley.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:28.720]   Yep.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.440]   He's running away from the chief executive role for the last two years, sitting most day-to-day
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:38.320]   business decisions to Google VP of product management, seller Kamengar.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.440]   I don't know where Steve Chen is.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.440]   He left his CEO.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.440]   He left a while ago.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.440]   No, to Google.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.440]   He went to my mother's of Google.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.440]   Okay.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.440]   But he's...
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.440]   Yeah, he's still working at Google.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:51.720]   Yeah, I think Chad stayed on...
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.880]   For him to have stayed on a CEO of an acquired company for that long is actually pretty amazing.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.520]   Maybe he just didn't vest right away.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:04.520]   So, Kamengar is now...
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:10.480]   Google employee number nine, by the way, is now running YouTube.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:15.880]   YouTube actually streamed, was it CBS coverage, was streaming on YouTube during the election?
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.920]   Let's talk a little bit about the election and then we'll wrap it up with our...
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.320]   Because we've got to get going here with our picks.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.320]   Four square, I love that.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.320]   Didn't you love that, Gina?
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.160]   I checked in and I got an I-voted badge.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.160]   Love that.
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.160]   Absolutely loved it.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:32.680]   I love the map where you could see how many other people checked in and you could play
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.760]   in real time watching people check in.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.960]   It was really this kind of sense of community.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.520]   We're all going out and doing this thing.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:41.400]   You heard a lot about voting on Twitter for sure if you were keeping up with that.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.600]   But it was definitely this sense of group civic action.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.920]   Do you think you were young people voted because of that?
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:50.400]   I definitely think it added a little...
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.360]   Hey, I know people who are insane about getting four square badges and they were like, "I
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.000]   will check in at a polling place."
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   I got that.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.400]   Halloween badge and the voting badge.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.400]   Yeah, me too.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.160]   It was a good week for badges.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.520]   It's true, "Hey, we all get those I-voted stickers on our shirts."
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.080]   It's the same thing but better.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.080]   It stays with you.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.880]   There was a little Instagram meme where people took a picture of their chests with their
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.680]   I-voted sticker, which I thought was kind of a neat meme.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.200]   Actually, Facebook did an amazing thing.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.800]   If you logged on to Facebook on Election Day, not only would you see a link that said, "Where's
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.080]   your polling place?"
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.880]   But you could check in that you voted and all your friends would see the badge.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:28.560]   You voted and they kept counting.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.640]   At the last time I checked, it was 12 million people on Facebook voted.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.800]   That's fantastic.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.800]   That's a lot.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.000]   That's using power for good.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.640]   Now, think about that.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.560]   I mean, that's got to have some get out the vote impact.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.040]   It has to.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.520]   YouTube, they keep testing YouTube live streaming.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.520]   I keep waiting.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.960]   I'd love to use it, guys, if you hint hint.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.320]   And CBS did live streaming of their coverage on YouTube.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.120]   All the networks, of course, streamed on their own websites.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.240]   NBC was supposed to use Twitter, and I didn't see it on Twitter, but supposedly they were
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.120]   going to stream on Twitter.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:12.240]   Despite all this, of course, 60% of eligible voters did not vote in the midterm elections
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.160]   yesterday, which is shameful.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.000]   But maybe we can get them next time.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.640]   All right.
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.880]   We're going to take a break.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.480]   Come back with your tip of the week, Gina.
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.520]   Your number of the week, Jeff, if we haven't stepped on it, stomped on it.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.120]   No, you didn't run, but I got another one.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.960]   Gina, for a rare world, killed mine, but I got another one.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.000]   I got a tip of the week.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.440]   I was going to do BLECO, which I really like, but Business Week says it's doomed, so I guess
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.440]   not.
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.240]   Have you used BLECO?
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.480]   I messed around with it to review it for Life Hacker.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.240]   Seems like I need an idea, but anytime you have to train people on how to search.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.240]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:55.040]   I don't know how much reach and adoption is going to see.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.120]   Oh, well.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.160]   I set up a couple of slash tags.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.400]   That's the idea is that are they Google search results?
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400]   Where do the search results come from?
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.240]   I don't think they're their own search results.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:10.720]   I think they seem like their own independent database of, but it was a very specifically
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:16.080]   narrow database of like three million-ish sites or something or three million-ish trusted
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:20.640]   verified, well-linked sites or networks it seemed like.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.520]   So the idea is you would set up a slash tag.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.520]   I have two.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:32.840]   One is a slash tag slash twit, which constrains the search to official pages from twits.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.360]   People like Gina and Jeff.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:40.160]   And then another one, which was taking my OPML with all the tech news sources and using
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160]   that.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:47.760]   If you do a search on BLECO for Google with my slash tag tech news, actually you probably
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:53.400]   do slash report slash tech news, then it would constrain the search to just the sources
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.160]   that I had already set up ahead of time, which I think is pretty useful, but you're absolutely
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.160]   right.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.160]   It's way too complicated.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.560]   No, is it we're going to use it.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.720]   Also ideally that way you could search for a U2 slash plane.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.480]   So you could look up things about the spy plane as opposed to a U2 slash band.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.680]   But can't you already do that on Google?
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:16.520]   Yeah, on Google, you just have to do just you know, U2 dash band, you know, dash to show
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.080]   all the things you don't want included, right?
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:22.080]   She's Gina's going to school me on this.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:26.400]   I would be searching my tip.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.680]   I'll leave it at that.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:33.760]   It is probably it is a far reach to get people to train people in a new way to search.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:34.760]   So good luck.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.760]   Yes.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:42.880]   And Jeff, I didn't mention your blog post on why I was rooting for cable vision.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:46.960]   Cable vision finally caved and gave Fox the extra money they wanted in the in the fight.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:52.000]   And by the way, as soon as cable vision gave, apparently dish also caved and Fox is now
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.360]   back on both.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:58.120]   But those companies are paying the higher subscribers fees that Fox demanded, which is
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.480]   the first problem is what's going to go to us.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.960]   You know, we just off for us.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.600]   One problem it is already noticeably by the way there.
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.720]   It is pandering to us now, Jeff.
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:11.320]   You just panry me and Gina.
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.320]   Love it.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.320]   She's cute.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.320]   She's cute with the big.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.320]   You don't even watch the show.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.320]   Do you?
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.320]   Do you want to show?
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.320]   I do now.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.320]   Oh, my wife can't stand it.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.320]   Really?
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.320]   First prostate loss now this, you know, you're turning into a girl.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:29.720]   I just I just I thought you of all people would be like, you know, just hately stayed
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.680]   it with a passion.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:36.000]   You know, our wife, I've got a bit something right now, but I like show tunes.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   I do too.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   I do too.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.120]   Any, anytime people burst into song, I don't care how crappy the show is.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:46.200]   If people burst into song every 10 minutes, I'm happy.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.840]   We're all little gay.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:52.200]   If I could figure out how to do numbers on Twitter, I would be.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.120]   We'd be bursting in the song every 10 minutes.
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.520]   We don't have to finish in the hat.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.800]   Yeah, we're sawed as odd not even worse.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.120]   Yeah, what it does is yes, I like son.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.120]   I love son.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.600]   Hey, let's take a break.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:10.600]   We're going to come back and I think we have a bonus tip from from our guest, Kevin Purdy
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.600]   as well.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.600]   Indeed.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.600]   Coming up in just a little bit.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.600]   But first I do want it.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:16.600]   I have a tip for you.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:17.600]   Here's a great tip.
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:18.600]   You got some old gadgets lying around.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.600]   Of course you do.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.240]   If you if you are a Twitter viewer or listener, you for sure have crap lying around.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.240]   That's just part of the game.
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:30.040]   Isn't it old phones, old laptops, old remote controls?
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.880]   Well, look at this is the time to get rid of it.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.680]   Make a little money on the side and maybe spend it on the next gadget, the next big
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.680]   thing.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:39.680]   And that's with Gazelle.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.680]   Don't sell it.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:41.680]   Gazelle it.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:48.000]   It's the best way to recycle your used gadgets and get full dollar for them.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.160]   Just go to Gazelle.com.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:52.040]   I wonder if I could put in the Logitech review.
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.040]   Let's just see.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.920]   Too soon.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920]   Too soon.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:57.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:58.920]   I saw it.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:19:59.920]   Maybe not.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:00.920]   I saw it.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:01.920]   Oh my God.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:02.920]   I can already sell the Logitech review.
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.280]   So no, it's not there.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.120]   But the squeeze box is the pocket digital, the click smart.
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.280]   Let's say you have a harmony.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.360]   Maybe you have an old harmony remote.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.560]   That would be a good example.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.880]   You know, you upgrade it to something better.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:15.880]   You enter it in.
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.600]   They've got all these different categories.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:18.600]   Oh, look.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.440]   You can even do old DVDs.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.840]   I didn't know that.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.840]   Wow.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:23.840]   Cool.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.240]   Or iPods.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:28.320]   What happens is I'll do something more common.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.880]   Let's do an iPod.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.880]   Oops.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:33.840]   Somehow I got tripods.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:36.040]   My spelling's not so good.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.240]   IPOD.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.200]   It will look up the various iPod models.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.200]   You can enter it in.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:44.240]   Let's say we have a fourth generation nano and we're ready to upgrade to the iPod Touch.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.720]   8 gigabytes.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:48.080]   You press the search button.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.640]   It then will ask you, well, does it power on?
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.640]   Yes.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.640]   Is it engraved?
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.640]   It's overall condition.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.640]   It's pretty good.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.920]   I have all the disks and the cables and the battery.
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:58.920]   Let's calculate the price.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:20:59.920]   33 bucks.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:04.160]   Now you can even see a graph of the chart of the price.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.320]   Then you add it to a box.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.120]   You click Add to a box.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.480]   They're going to send you a box.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.560]   Postage paid.
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:10.800]   You fill it up.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.040]   Actually, I'm going to provide my own box.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.320]   They'll send, they'll pay for the shipping.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.000]   You fill it up.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   Put as many gadgets as you want in there.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   Send it back to them.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   They're experts.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.640]   We'll strip your data out of it.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.880]   You don't have to worry about that.
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.200]   Verify the condition as stated and then send you a check.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.920]   Or if you wish, you can donate that to charity.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:36.280]   Gazelle has a great fund to cause page where you can do a gadget drive instead of a cake
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.440]   sale for your favorite charity.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:43.560]   If it's not worth anything at all but you just want to recycle it, Gazelle does great
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.840]   earth-friendly recycling too.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:50.480]   Nothing goes into the landfill.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:57.800]   It's all EPA-certified recyclers, green recyclers so you know that it's getting a good home.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.560]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:05.160]   Now after you go there and you add up all your devices and you get a check and a price rather
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:11.120]   and the offer code TWIG, you'll get an additional 5% bonus on your Gazelle box.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.120]   What could be better than that?
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.120]   Don't sell it.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:16.560]   Gazelle, it's a great way to recycle your used gadgets.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.840]   Gazelle.com.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:20.840]   We love Gazelle.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:26.920]   We use it all the time actually because we're the kind of the central for gadget central
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:29.080]   for old stuff.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.480]   Someday that Logitech review will be there.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.920]   Gina Trapana, your tip of the week.
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:38.920]   My tip this week is a kind of interesting new take on the mobile keyboard.
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.840]   It's called 8 Pen.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.120]   I'm not quite sold on it yet.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:46.040]   You have to spend some time with it to learn how to type with it but it's an Android app.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.200]   It's an Android market now.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.480]   I think it's like a buck 99 or maybe maybe a pound 99.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:23:01.320]   It lets you type by dragging your finger across a grid and kind of an 8 figure 8 motion gesture.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.960]   There's actually a YouTube video and I'm searching for it now that you can see kind
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.960]   of it's the8pen.com.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:10.160]   You can watch a demonstration of how it works.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:13.400]   If you don't like pecking away a regular Android keyboard, if Swipe didn't do it for
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.160]   you, 8 Pen might be it.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.800]   The problem with 8 Pen though is that the learning curve is pretty steep.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.520]   I only spent a few minutes with it and it definitely took me some time to get used to
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:27.960]   it but I've heard from people who stuck it out and learned the new way to type that it
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.080]   was super super fast.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:32.520]   So skip ahead in this video.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:33.520]   It does a kind of thing.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.520]   It says typing on your mobile phone is really slow.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.520]   Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:38.520]   You want to get to the point.
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.520]   It looks like an X yeah.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.280]   So this is how it works.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:44.840]   You start your finger starts in the middle and then kind of flows around and chooses
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:45.840]   letters.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.840]   That's weird.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:52.200]   It's really weird but also really kind of interesting so the letters are going to show
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.200]   up soon.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.200]   They're going to fill it in.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.800]   So you like this better than Swipe or just an alternative?
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   It's just an alternative.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.800]   I'm not sold on it yet.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.320]   I just started playing with it today before the show and it was weird.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.640]   I could see the potential.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.120]   It's got this deep learning curve and this one.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.120]   Well that's what I'd worry about.
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.800]   I don't know how to type with this.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:08.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.800]   That's the thing.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.200]   On that demo the letters should fill in.
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.920]   If you skip ahead you'll see where the letters will show up.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:19.400]   So it's kind of, yeah so keep going, keep going.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:20.400]   The letters still aren't.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.400]   Oh there they are.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.400]   You can see them.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.400]   So that's just weird.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.280]   It would take some time to get used to it but once you get a sense of where the letters
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.960]   are and they've actually designed the keyboard so that the letters that we most use in the
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.680]   English language are closer to the middle.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.960]   The letters that we use least on the outer edges so it's easier to type.
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:38.960]   Oh good.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:39.960]   They're all just a little bit more.
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:40.960]   They're all just a little bit more.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:41.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:43.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:45.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:46.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:50.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:52.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:53.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:54.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:01.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:06.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:10.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:12.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:14.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:16.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:24.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:31.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:38.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:45.960]   So you're just going to be able to do that.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.960]   How much is it?
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.960]   I think it's a pound 99 in the Android market.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.960]   You can also, if there are certain things you type a lot, you can create a gestures.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:57.960]   You can say like sideways eight is going to be like talk to you later, Leo, or something like that.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:04.960]   So you can program in things that you say often, like your email address or something that's annoying to type.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:05.960]   Interesting.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.960]   All right.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:11.960]   H Pen, the number eight PEN is on the Android market.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.960]   Also, I had one more thing.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:25.960]   Sorry, I had some geeks on Twitter saying that you have to mention this for nerds who run their own web server, Google released mod page speed, which is an Apache module, which can speed up your web pages by 50%.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:26.960]   Check it out.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.960]   If you're on your own web server, it's better than some of the other caching solutions.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.960]   I think it's on top of other.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.960]   Oh, I see.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960]   Yeah, it's a Apache module.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   And there's a demo of an AdSense site running it and not running it.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.960]   And it's almost almost a 50% increase.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:42.960]   Wow.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:43.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.960]   Well, Google's all about the fast web, as we know.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:46.960]   Yes.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.960]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.960]   So now that Gina's told my three things Google made a mistake with.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:54.960]   Sorry, Jeff.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:55.960]   It's too small a number.
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:56.960]   You can't do it.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:57.960]   All right.
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.960]   Gina, I was going to raise it and sacrifice it anyway, because it was relevant.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:10.960]   So Facebook said that the sheer number of fans alone, imagine the extra data they have, but that alone predicted more than 70% of key races.
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:11.960]   Wow.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:16.960]   More fans equals 74% winning percentage in key house races.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:24.960]   You know, I saw Randy Zuckerberg on CNN say that the top three friended people were GOP candidates.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:27.960]   Wasn't that interesting?
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:28.960]   It is.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.960]   I mean, 80% of Senate wins foreshadowed on Facebook, says their press release.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.960]   House Democrats incumbents lost on Facebook before losing on election day.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.960]   That's to say that 46 house Democratic Democrats lost their seats.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:45.960]   More than 78% of them had fewer Facebook fans and their challengers, which I think in part was because they were the old farts.
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:46.960]   Right.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.960]   So it's just, it's just really fascinating.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.960]   Again, that's a very simple, quick layer of the data that's there in friends.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:03.960]   But, you know, if you really start to analyze the discussion about these candidates beforehand on Twitter and Facebook and back to the kind of, we feel fine thing.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.960]   Imagine what's there to predict races in more reliable ways.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.960]   This is like Larry saying, we know what you want before you know kind of.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.960]   Eric said, we know where you are.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:15.960]   We know what you want.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:16.960]   That's Eric.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:17.960]   Okay.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.960]   Very interesting.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.960]   Kevin, you got a little tip for us.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:22.960]   I do.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:32.960]   I recently was in Florida and I got off the plane and I swear I didn't plan this, but I got off the plane and my wife and I were starving and I Google maps searched virtually.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.960]   No.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:34.960]   And I did.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:35.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:40.960]   And so I looked for it and I was with my Nexus one and I was like, come on.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.960]   Welcome to Twitter.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.960]   This weekend.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.960]   And I kept looking for it and it did know where I was.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.960]   It just, the GPS was all messed up and I kept trying to say I'm not in Buffalo.
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:53.960]   Come on.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.960]   Can't you tell from the weather and it wouldn't respond.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:01.960]   And so I moaned about it on my complete Android Twitter feed like I tend to do.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:08.960]   And one reader gave me a really good recommendation for an app called GPS status and toolbox.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:13.960]   And you just search for GPS status that will usually bring it up in the market.
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:21.960]   And it's a data geek stream because you can use the share button and literally send your GPS coordinates to people.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.960]   Very specific, you know, very specific type of stuff.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:27.960]   And you can see, you know, all kinds of crazy.
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:30.960]   If you were to geo caching, this would be a great app.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:37.960]   But the main thing that I liked it for is that you can use it to reset your GPS data in your phone.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:46.960]   And I guess sometimes I'm not an expert on how it works, but you know, your GPS location, your pings get stored inside the phone kind of locally.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:52.960]   And you can set this to just wipe out your GPS and get it restarted without having to actually restart your phone.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.960]   Yeah, you need to get rid of the almanac file so it will reload those.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:56.960]   There you go.
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:03.960]   And a reader tell or a Twitter follower tells me that you can also use it to automatically wipe out your GPS every so often.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:10.960]   Which gives you a slightly shorter react was it a longer react position time, but still it would have been just the first time.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:18.960]   And it would have been a much nicer thing for me to have when I was in Florida trying to get to in a four-mentioned Mexican themed fast food restaurant.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:27.960]   Yeah, every time I travel, that happens to me because you have to create new almanac pages which tell it where the satellites are and all that stuff before you can get a good, a good fix.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:29.960]   Good tip.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:30.960]   What was the name of that?
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:31.960]   GPS status and toolbox.
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:33.960]   The GPS status should just bring it up.
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:34.960]   Excellent.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.960]   I have a couple of actually three tips for you. Of course, there is a new Facebook app, 1.4. So go to your Android marketplace and get it.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:44.960]   It has a lot of nice features if you're a Facebook user.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:51.960]   Also, Twitter has updated its app to give it the same basically the same look and feel as the iPhone version of Twitter which was basically Tweety.
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:58.960]   So if you are an old Tweety user, you'll be very happy about the new Twitter Android app which is a little bit more powerful.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.960]   I don't know if they got rid of the clouds. I hope they did.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:02.960]   The moving stuff.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:03.960]   No.
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:04.960]   I'm like, what was that?
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.960]   You never liked those clouds.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.960]   I never liked those clouds.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:15.960]   But Kevin was mentioning as we mentioned that Droppio is going away. Sam Lesson is hired by Facebook and Facebook and unlike Friend Feed which they kind of continue to run.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:21.960]   They said, you know, we're not creating any more free Droppio accounts. If you've got a paid account, you better get out by December.
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.960]   That's it. It's over in December 15th.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:25.960]   Yeah. I was looking for a replacement too.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:30.960]   Now, this isn't exactly a one for one feature replacement, but it's very intriguing.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.960]   In fact, I found out about it because they tweeted. They said, hey, folks, we're looking for a Droppio replacement.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.960]   You should think a little bit about Tonito.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.960]   Are you aware of this one, Kevin?
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.960]   Seen it. I guess I didn't dig it into it.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:46.960]   So there's two parts to this. There's a hardware part and a software part.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:51.960]   You don't have to have the hardware. I have ordered the hardware which is basically Pogo Plug Plus.
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.960]   It includes BitTorrent and other features.
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:58.960]   But there's a software version that basically gives you a right click, share this file.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:04.960]   And effectively creates on your own hard drive a file share, much like a Droppio would be.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.960]   It's private and secure.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:11.960]   You send this special unique link to the person you want to share the file with.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:17.960]   I guess you have to leave your machine on, but otherwise it kind of does the work for you.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:21.960]   If you know this might even be easier than Droppio since you don't have to upload anything.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:23.960]   Isn't that an absolute protect?
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:31.960]   I don't know. I have to play with it. You do have a -- it's secure by obscurity because it's an odd URL.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:38.960]   Although you can create a public share as well with your username.tonydoid.com.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:44.960]   So it's very interesting. And then if you add the hardware to it, you really have your own cloud storage,
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:47.960]   you know, with your own hard drives and so forth.
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:52.960]   So it's very interesting. It's not exactly Droppio,
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.960]   but it is fully software based and it has some interesting features.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:01.960]   In some ways might make it better than Droppio. There's no storage limit at all, for instance.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:08.960]   So, well, we're looking at -- I signed up for it and I've ordered the hardware and I'll give you a review of the hardware.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:12.960]   When it arrives, I'm a big Pogo plug fan. I love Pogo plug.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:19.960]   But there's a free software service as well. And that might be something that Droppio refugees might want to look into.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:24.960]   Alright, that's it. We're out of time. Boy, are we out of time. Thank you, everybody. Jeff's got to go catch a train.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.960]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis. Author of What Would You Do?
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:30.960]   There's a dude only on the way there, by the way. You can stay on the water. I'm getting my burrito bowl.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:34.960]   Get your great out of all. Get your great out of all.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:39.960]   Musmeresting.com. Gina Trafani, smarterware.org. Kevin Purdy, the author of this great new book, The Complete Android Guide.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:43.960]   If you've got Android, you need the book. CompleteAndroidGuide.com.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:48.960]   You can follow him on Twitter as well. Thank you, Kevin, for being here. We appreciate it.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:54.960]   Thank you very much. Have a great day. Have a great day, everybody. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
