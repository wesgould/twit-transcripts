[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.760]   the strange connection between Media Lab

[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.320]   You won't believe your eyes.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.160]   They should shouldn't.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.440]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.280]   On Twig.

[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.040]   This week in Google.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.400]   Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IOT
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.760]   in the IOT podcast.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.920]   Hello, Stacey.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.200]   Hello, everyone.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.080]   It's good to see you.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.880]   Professor Jeffrey Jarvis,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.680]   the Leonard Tap Professor for journalistic innovation
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.880]   at the Craig Newack Graduate School of Journalism
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.240]   at the City of our city of New York is also here.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.280]   Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.120]   Hey.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.040]   And it's just down the road of peace from Bedminster.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.560]   Yeah, I know when there's a disturbance in the force.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.720]   Did you see Tim Cook's helicopter come in a couple of days ago?
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.960]   Oh, no.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.760]   Yeah, he had dinner.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.360]   The funny thing about Tim Cook,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.240]   this is actually a good CEO move.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.640]   He went, had dinner with the president at the golf course
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.760]   and explained to him that tariffs would hurt Apple
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.880]   because their number one competitor, Samsung,
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.400]   doesn't have to pay them.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.280]   But Apple would, starting September 1st
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.160]   on a few of their products and by December 15th
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.360]   and all of their products.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.200]   And the president said, "Oh, that's a good point.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.800]   "I'll think about it."
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.880]   Never mind.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.200]   "I'll think about it."
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.840]   Gun control, never mind.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.960]   "Well, I don't know.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.080]   "I'll think about it may not mean anything."
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.920]   It may actually--
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.760]   Yeah, hold on.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.280]   "We don't know what that means."
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.360]   So did you watch the show "Borgon"
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.480]   or as they would say it there?
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.840]   "Boon."
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.680]   "Boon?"
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.840]   No, what is "Boon"?
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.680]   No, what do you--
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.960]   It is a magnificent show about a woman
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.640]   who becomes the Stott's minister,
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.480]   the prime minister of Denmark.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.800]   I want to start a popular movement to get a sequel on
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.360]   just to have her deal with Trump.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   Oh.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.200]   Brilliant.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.040]   It's brilliant show.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.680]   You know, then Mark.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.160]   By the way, there is some strategic benefit
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.520]   to buying Greenland.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.360]   (laughs)
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.200]   And for for sale?
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.400]   Well, everything's for sale if you offer the right price.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.880]   20 years from now, it's gonna be prime farmland.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.440]   Yeah, there's one good reason.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.680]   It's all gonna be great.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.880]   So you may note if you're watching the video
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.520]   that there are a surprisingly large number
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.240]   of uneaten sweets in front of me.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.920]   Leo can't eat them.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.600]   And there is the number three
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.760]   for the 13th birthday of Stacey's daughter.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.680]   No, this is the technically the third,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.280]   exactly when we moved in, right?
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.120]   Is that right?
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.200]   Third anniversary of our move into the East Side Studios
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.440]   three years ago, which if my calculations are correct
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.840]   means we have seven more years in the lease.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.280]   (laughs)
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.040]   You're like Howard Stern counting them.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.880]   (laughs)
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.240]   Anyway, so we're celebrating.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.040]   We have a little party you can now ignore all those sweets,
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.960]   but you can't ignore that sign in front of me.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.040]   I just thank you, by the way,
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.280]   to Jason Halfer filling in for me last week.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.280]   Stacey's trying to read the sign.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.360]   I'm like, it's a podcast?
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.720]   That's what it says, it's a podcast.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.720]   I was at a big podcast,
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.160]   the big podcast convention in the US
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.200]   in Orlando all week long.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.400]   Unfortunately, named podcast movement.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.520]   But it was a fine movement.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.520]   And one of the things that people were saying is
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.200]   you really should call it a podcast.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.680]   15 years ago at the first podcast expo,
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.040]   I beseeched my fellow podcasters.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.600]   Let's please, let's not use Apple's trademark in this name.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.520]   It won't always be on an iPod someday.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.880]   You'll be able to get shows elsewhere.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.400]   Somebody will invent something like YouTube.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.880]   I think I was right, but boy,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.880]   nobody took up my suggestion of netcast at all.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.280]   In fact, one of the things I kind of am happy about,
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.680]   and apparently according to,
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.880]   I think it was the Daily News,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.440]   I can thank Conan O'Brien for this.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.200]   Everybody knows what podcasts are now.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.320]   So I can say I'm a podcaster and people don't go,
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.680]   what is that?
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.800]   And we can call our shows not netcast
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.720]   'cause no one knows what that is.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.560]   If I say I'm a netcast.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.080]   Are you changing your living?
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.120]   Even the new "The New Year" show will now say,
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.440]   instead of netcast you love from people you trust podcasts,
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.280]   you love--
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.680]   Holy hanakroy.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.600]   I know.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.720]   I've given in a thousand episodes later.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   Thanks to team Coco, we now know podcasts exist.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.960]   So it's a podcast.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.520]   Strictly so relieved after a vector.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.280]   You can listen to it on your Echo.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.440]   Is that a podcast?
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.800]   You can watch it on YouTube.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.200]   Is that a podcast?
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   You can even in some cases listen to podcasts on the radio.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.840]   Is that a podcast?
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.720]   I think Dave Weiner and the better of this
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.000]   doesn't like the term either, right?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.840]   No one likes it.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.200]   In fact, Apple at one point was going to,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.480]   was suing companies with the word pod
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.280]   in their name including podcasts.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.120]   Yeah, the cover of Variety, Conan O'Brien,
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.640]   the podcast revolution.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.840]   Wait, this is a story from like recently?
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.120]   Today, there can be,
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.080]   it's on the cover of Variety magazine.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.440]   It says and other top hosts though,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.920]   you're a top host.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.760]   I don't know.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.200]   Audio boom, audio's back, baby, audio boom.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.440]   I like podcasts like the phrase,
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.760]   I like the word podcast.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.320]   I do, it's humble.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.200]   It's humble and it's nicer than like radio show,
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.400]   which is basically what this is.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.240]   I mean.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.080]   Yeah, it's a radio show.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.920]   It's a, well, there was a guy, it's so funny
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.520]   because what goes around comes around.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.240]   From Edison Research, Tom's a great guy,
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.120]   very smart guy, was talking about his research.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.400]   And even he at the end of his talk,
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.280]   the keynote at one of the keynotes at this event,
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.200]   the podcast movement,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.440]   said it's a show, which is actually accurate.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.280]   It's just a show.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.080]   You know, it's a show that doesn't come through an antenna,
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.480]   but there's still a show.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.800]   So anyway, it's a show.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.640]   It's a radio show.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.480]   I think you're right.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.520]   And we do videos, so we're kind of like a radio,
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.640]   a TV show, a radio show, which is.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.080]   Maybe you should call it a netcast
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.480]   because it's gonna come over the internet.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.280]   That's why I wanted to call it an,
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.800]   there was two reasons.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.720]   It was on the internet.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   That's how we distributed it.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   She baited you.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.400]   That it worked.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.240]   It worked.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.080]   It worked.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.920]   It did.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.760]   It's not a vlog.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.600]   It's not a vlog.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.440]   I never liked vlog.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.260]   No vlogging.
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.080]   I hate vlogging.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.000]   I tried to vlog the thing.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.400]   Of course, I'm not an email.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.240]   Jeff.blog.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.240]   I will.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.560]   I will say,
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.640]   one of my favorites is, what is that?
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.760]   Neil Patrick Harris.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.480]   Oh, a blog, what's his name?
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.560]   Dr. E.B.L.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.560]   Dr. Horvall?
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.400]   Dr. Horvall?
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.240]   Dr. Horvall?
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.920]   Musical, I can't remember.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.160]   He talks about his vlog, right?
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.760]   Or he may even call it like a video vlog.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.200]   God, only knows.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   It was a vlog.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.480]   Dr. Horvall's sing along vlog.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.320]   That's called.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.160]   There it is.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.120]   I need to show that to my daughter.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.960]   Oh, yes.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.040]   That now is lost in the mists of time too, by the way.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.240]   That was the other thing I realized
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.960]   when I went to this podcast thing.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.120]   Nobody knows who I am.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.440]   Nobody knows what the,
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.560]   the early days of podcasting might as well be Abe Lincoln.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.240]   It's like, it's like,
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.320]   it's complete, these young people,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.440]   and you know, they don't know any of this stuff.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.360]   Adam Curry, who's that?
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.360]   They don't know any of this stuff.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.200]   So it's fine.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.040]   I don't mind.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.880]   I don't care.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.720]   I'm happy.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.920]   We like our little show, don't we?
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.040]   Whatever you want to call it.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.440]   We're glad you're here.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.440]   We're going to talk today about Google and Facebook and media
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.840]   and news and all of that stuff.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.120]   Because that's what we do on this show.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.400]   And audio is okay.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.240]   Audio is great.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.520]   The telegraph had a story this week
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.360]   that the end of audio book's snobbery
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.560]   is scientists find reading and listening,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.600]   activate the same parts of the brain.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.120]   I've been saying that also,
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.400]   because I used to do the audible ads
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.200]   and I'd say I read a new book and people say,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.240]   oh, you Leo, you didn't read it.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.080]   You listened to it.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.640]   It's the same words.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.360]   I hate that on the audio book.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.720]   They say, well, in this audio book, no, it's still a book.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.560]   And they can say it.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.400]   I can call it a book.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.840]   I don't like audio books.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.320]   They're too slow.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.160]   You can speed them up.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.240]   No, you just speed them up.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.080]   The problem at all, you speed them up.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.920]   Yeah, I know.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.760]   Really easy.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.400]   But it sounds okay for a while.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.040]   Then I have to work harder.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.400]   When I read a book, I don't feel like I'm working.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.240]   I'm the only person on it.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.840]   I feel like I'm working.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.720]   Oh my gosh, Jeff, it hurts.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.280]   I feel like I'm reading.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.960]   I mean, I've never listened to the Daily
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.120]   and I happened to turn on it.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.960]   I was playing with my Android audio because it got...
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.800]   You mean with Michael Pabara?
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.400]   He speaks slowly.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   Slowly.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.240]   Yes.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.040]   This is Michael Pabara.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.520]   Oh.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.720]   We've done the Bob and Ray routine on the show before.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.840]   Yeah, it's slow talk.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.520]   Slow talkers of America.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.520]   That's so...
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.520]   So I was also reading some papers
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.240]   from a 2013 paper from the journal Book History
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.400]   talked about the book after Edison.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.120]   I know everyone thought that it was going to be...
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.160]   Everything was going to be recorded.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.120]   And the New York Times talked about how it was bottled speech.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.960]   Oh my gosh.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.880]   Bottled up for future use.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.040]   Oh my gosh.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.480]   Audiences would be able to purchase bottled orations
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.680]   and bottled sermons.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.440]   Sold in court bottles for 50 cents apiece.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.800]   It's a bottle cast.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   Now we have the name.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.560]   If they had a taste, would have a well-stocked oratorical cellar.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.400]   I do.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.400]   It's on my...
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.440]   We'll be able to entertain guests with the
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.440]   cellar phone.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.600]   The counterpoint.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.760]   I wish we had Mark Twain's actual voice.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.600]   So that is...
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.400]   It is an interesting watershed, isn't it?
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.720]   James McQuarter talks about how everything changed
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.600]   with Edison's recording.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.280]   It's the first time a human voice has been recorded.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.280]   We know what Edison sounded like, but nobody prior.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.800]   And we don't know what Lincoln sounded like.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   We've heard descriptions.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.720]   We don't know what he sounded like.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.160]   By the way, Stacy, you'll be happy to know this was from
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.840]   the Edison Research Talk at Podcast Movement.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.560]   He compared people who have been listening to podcasts
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.560]   for a long time.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.320]   He calls them veterans with people who are just new to podcasting.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.600]   He called them rookies.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.720]   30% of rookies listen to podcasts at a higher speed than nominal.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.320]   Only 20% of the old timers do.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.920]   Have you tried this, Stacy?
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.920]   Oh, yeah, I listen to it.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.280]   I mean, I listen at 1.5.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.960]   I mean, it depends on who's speaking to.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.960]   Have you tried books that way?
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.360]   It's amazing how you do it fast.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   I don't...
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   I mean, like...
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   Here's why I don't like it.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.880]   We'll get people visiting.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.480]   We have some nice visitors in studio today.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   Who have...
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   Oh, my visitors!
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.880]   Who have never listened to this show at normal speed.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.920]   Najee Ramon and Gina.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.440]   And they're being really slow now.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.440]   They think we shall drunk.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.720]   They think, you all sound like Nancy Pelosi.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.880]   What's wrong with you?
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.320]   We're all talking like you.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.360]   Well, Jeff can apparently speed up quite a bit.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   I don't think I can.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.560]   Maybe it's because I'm from the south.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.320]   Yeah, you got the y'all.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.400]   Well, people in the south, they think I speak very quickly.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.160]   Are you a New Yorker?
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.400]   Why are you talking so fast, Stacy?
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   You also have field syllables in your words.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   (laughs)
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   I have to go through actual thought here to slow down.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.280]   If you got me at normal speed, I'm really fast.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.920]   You mean you're not thinking when you're talking at normal speed?
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.600]   No, no, no, I have to think about slowing down.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.600]   Oh, you force yourself.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.760]   Oh, I do too.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.480]   Oh, I have the same exact problem.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.040]   In fact, the only time I've ever recorded an audiobook,
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.800]   Audible, let me come in and record a short fairy tale.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.440]   What?
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.440]   Only one.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.760]   I'm gonna, but that's in my future
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.240]   because I would love to do an audiobook.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   You should do lots of them.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.360]   Yeah, I would love to.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.560]   But I don't have time right now.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.440]   But the one note I kept getting from the producer
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.840]   who's sitting over your shoulder is slow down, slow down,
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.120]   slow down, you're speeding up, slow down.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.440]   Yup.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.600]   'Cause I try to get, it's you and me,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.680]   I think are the same, Jeff, we're trying to get all our words out.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.680]   (imitates sound)
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.920]   You know, the other thing you could do is you could volunteer
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.480]   for learning ally formerly known as recording
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.560]   for the blind dyslexic.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.840]   Oh, I would do that, actually.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.520]   It's a very good cause.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.360]   Did you?
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.240]   My mom's aunt or cousin, I can't remember, did it.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.280]   And so she had me go in and read at one point long,
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.440]   long time ago.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.520]   But yes, I too would like to do like audio work.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.080]   There's an article, I used to be on the board.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.280]   You could put it in a cork bottle.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.120]   Yes.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.960]   My oratorial bottle.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.800]   My oratorial bottle.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.880]   (laughs)
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   Oratorial.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.280]   Oratorial bottle.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.120]   There we go.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.760]   Yeah, I love reading a lot, I did it to my kids.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.560]   This is why I think audio books work
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.800]   because wasn't the first book you ever read
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.960]   to you by your parent?
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.240]   Yeah, of course.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.400]   That's how we first read is we were read too.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.800]   And I love the idea that it changes
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.960]   the definition of literacy.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.080]   Oh, that's true too.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.600]   Anybody can listen to a book.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   Yes.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.240]   No.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.680]   Okay, so are we gonna talk, we should talk about Google.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.320]   I actually have thoughts.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.200]   'Cause Stacey wants to go make some sticky rice.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.020]   Mangos.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.000]   Some sticky rice.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.800]   And go sticky rice and apple crisp.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.440]   Oh man.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.280]   I know.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.120]   Okay, well.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.960]   I mean, this is apple caramel sauce.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.520]   I have a Google story, but I bet it's not the one
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.040]   you wanna talk about, but I'm gonna mention it.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.560]   'Cause I put these Nest cameras up,
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.400]   there's two in our studio, and then I have around our house,
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.560]   I have Nest cameras.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.040]   All of a sudden I have a big bright green light on all of them.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.360]   (laughing)
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.720]   Nest, I had them all turned off.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.640]   Google has decided for privacy reasons
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.320]   that all Nest camera lights now must be on.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.720]   You cannot turn them off.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.400]   Yup.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.240]   And I'm gonna--
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.080]   I'm gonna count on this.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.600]   I guess, yeah, because, but,
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.480]   but I think my security cameras,
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.000]   I don't want bad guys to know they're on camera.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.040]   I don't know what, yeah.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.960]   I don't want them to know where the camera is,
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.840]   so they can disconnect it.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.520]   Well, if your camera can be disconnected that easily,
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.680]   then-- All cameras can.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.360]   You just take scissors to them.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.200]   I'm like, so--
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.960]   You know what they do in the movies?
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.400]   They take a spray paint and they spray in the lens.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.160]   But you can see most of the cameras anyway
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.440]   if you're looking for them, right?
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.520]   Unless you're actively hiding them in the green light,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.200]   which is them away. I'm not.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.840]   I mean, the flip side is,
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.480]   has someone who thinks about privacy and things like that,
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.080]   and there's still tons of spy cameras,
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.440]   so this doesn't solve that problem.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.680]   But Google's trying as an industry,
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.360]   a player in the industry to say,
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.680]   hey, here's a best practice.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.520]   It's also because Congress sent them that lovely letter
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.760]   saying, hey, what about that secret microphone
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.360]   you had in your products and what other privacy
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.200]   violating things?
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.880]   So Google's like, whoa, okay, here.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.720]   I get it.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.560]   I get it.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.240]   So in settings for Nest cameras,
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.480]   this should have been the change log,
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.480]   but I'm leading with it 'cause it punks the hell out of me.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.920]   In settings for Nest cameras and Nest Hello,
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.840]   you can no longer turn off the status light.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.400]   You can dim it, but it doesn't get very dim.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.800]   And it's bright green, so especially at night,
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.280]   those security cameras, they pop out at you.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.360]   You know where they are.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.800]   So now some people will put tape over their camera lens
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.040]   or their laptop, some will put it over the indicator light
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.040]   on the camera. - I guess I could do that.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.080]   That was actually, so I will say,
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.000]   when Euro launched that feature,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.920]   and I don't know if they're still an advertiser or not,
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.800]   but when they launched that feature
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.000]   where it dimmed the little LED on the--
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.920]   - Oh, it was great.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.360]   I turned it off. - I was like, thank you.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.120]   - Yeah, everything that has LEDs,
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.440]   you should be able to turn the lights off
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.080]   'cause they're often in bedrooms.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.720]   - Well, who's put it?
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.320]   You don't put your IP camera in your bedroom.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.080]   - No, but a beacon, but I have an Euro beacon
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.880]   near our bedroom and I don't want that light.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.840]   - Yeah, well, and that makes sense.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.120]   And I turn off all the lights
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.760]   or I stick things over them and tape.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.160]   - Yeah, you end up taping over it, which is fine,
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.760]   but it's kind of ugly.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.480]   It should be, I mean, it's a reasonable thing
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.640]   to put us off for a setting, but anyway.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.200]   All right, that's just my pet peeve of the week.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.000]   - Okay, while we're talking about it--
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.880]   - I feel better. - Yes, I do.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.520]   - We can talk about the Google Nest Home Migration,
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.840]   which is coming rapidly August 31st.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.640]   - Happening kind of as we speak, isn't it?
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.200]   - Well, yes, so it's an option now that you can do it.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.440]   Kevin actually did it, and I put a link in the show notes
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.840]   to Kevin doing it.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.000]   - Would you give us the background?
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   - So if you bought a Nest device,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   it used to-- - So back--
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.800]   - Works with Nest was the thing, right?
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.600]   - Yes, so back in May, Google said,
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.960]   hey, we're gonna kill our works with Nest program.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.120]   And instead of Nest having its own,
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.160]   all Nest devices work through the Nest app
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.520]   and Nest kind of has its own call out of brain.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.200]   It's some brain.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.440]   Google has decided Google Home is now going to the B,
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.480]   the brains for Nest.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.760]   So all the commands that Nest devices could usually
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.240]   like send out to the internet and do.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.840]   Now all that's gonna go through the Google Home devices.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.400]   And Google did this till kind of locked down its ecosystem,
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.600]   make it a little less confusing.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.320]   It makes a lot of sense, but people were really upset
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.400]   because if your Nest thermostat, for example,
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:38.000]   if you have like an IFT setting where when my Nest reaches,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.400]   I don't know, 77 degrees, turn on a fan.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.800]   Now your Nest can't tell that IFT,
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.240]   if you would have your Google Home say that to IFT.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.400]   - Is that an IFT issue?
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.000]   - Well, no, no, no, that's how this program
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.120]   is designed to work now.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.640]   So basically it cuts down on the number of integrations
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.320]   that Google has to worry about and manage
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.320]   like all these third parties with your data.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.000]   - Oh, you'd prefer to do it directly.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.800]   - I don't because I'm gonna have to rebuild everything.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.640]   - Well, that's one, you have to redo everything.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.080]   But isn't there a convenience to having a third party
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.880]   like Nest like if this than that?
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.800]   Because you can do more.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.720]   - Yeah, well, you have cross-platform integrations.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.280]   - Yes, and you can still have that.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.760]   It's just going to Google gets more control over
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.240]   who gets access to certain triggers in the Nest devices.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.000]   - That's the privacy thing again.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.160]   - It's both privacy, it's also data security.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.600]   It's preparation for the coming lockdown.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.840]   It's clear that Google thinks that people are going to,
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.160]   that Congress and regulators are going to be paying
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.680]   attention to this.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.440]   And also it's kind of a best practice.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.000]   I mean, being able to really easily see
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.840]   who's got access to your data makes a lot of sense.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.400]   And I'm talking about it as a company
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.280]   who provides access to consumer data.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.600]   - Completely agree, yeah.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   - And it's also harder nowadays to make your own ift triggers.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:10.640]   - Well, that's a combination of ift and
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.960]   - That's changing their business models.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.240]   - Yeah, so yeah, there's a lot happening here.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.920]   If did send out a thing saying,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.400]   "Hey, if you have Nest integrations that you like,
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.880]   do not sign over and this is the thing,
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.080]   don't change over to a Google account
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.720]   from your Nest account unless you are really prepared
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.560]   to move forward."
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.920]   There is no going back.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.560]   So that's one thing you need to know.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.360]   This is going to break your integrations.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.400]   So you're going to have to redo like the things
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.000]   with Madam A, your Amazon Echo,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.720]   ift doesn't have an integration right now,
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.080]   so you can't do anything with that.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.160]   So, and it's also going to break some of like the other
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.320]   direct works with Nest integrations like with hue lights
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.000]   and that sort of thing.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.400]   So you're going to have to redo a lot of stuff.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.640]   - In case you haven't noticed, Stacey is an IoT expert.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.480]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.640]   - And she is, no, no.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.480]   - And I play one of the dead cats.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.960]   - The IoT.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.680]   - And has a strangely elaborate IoT setup at home.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.320]   If you migrated most of that stuff
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.480]   that you had in Austin to Seattle.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.320]   - I haven't.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.760]   This is like my own personal like guilt is,
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.320]   I don't need a lot of it.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.560]   I don't want a lot of it.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.720]   - It's so funny that you say that
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.200]   because I put in Nest thermostats and all that stuff
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.720]   and then I moved and that they sat in a box.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.680]   I never, I just like, yeah.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.440]   And same thing with hue lights.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.200]   - I mean, I have, I don't even have,
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.680]   and there's a lot of things in my house I don't have.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.400]   Like, I don't have a doorbell at all.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.240]   - What?
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.400]   - I know, I'm like--
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.240]   - What happens on how long--
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.080]   - What happens on how long--
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.160]   - Anybody coming over.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.000]   - Well, that's a really--
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.120]   - So I was like, oh, I should get a ring
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.960]   and just put it out there.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.600]   But I'm like, oh, you know, in the last two months,
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.680]   people knocked, I've got a dog, she barks.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.880]   I know when people are at the door.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.040]   - Well, you know, and I have a ring,
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.880]   but I've been thinking that since I have
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.480]   so many Nest things now and Google assistants.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.800]   - We Nest, hello, doorbell is an excellent one.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.640]   - Is it good?
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.560]   Should I get a hello instead?
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.680]   - I'd have to take the ring out.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.520]   See, this is the whole problem with this whole IOT thing.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.800]   And if I moved, I'm not gonna bring all that with me.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.400]   - Oh yeah, I left a huge chunk of my stuff.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.240]   But yes, I will say--
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.120]   - You can actually open your blinds with a string now?
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.040]   - Well, yeah, yeah, I do.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.800]   - Wow, you're renting. - Now you're renting.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.640]   - That's rough.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.600]   - You're renting. - I am renting.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.960]   - So there is a good reason for that.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.200]   Maybe when you buy, you will--
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.000]   - When I buy, I will, the first thing I'm gonna do
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.400]   is install Lutron switches everywhere.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.480]   But I bet you Andrew, your husband is very happy right now.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.000]   - He's actually a little frustrated.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.200]   'Cause I don't have, it's an old house,
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   so we have like--
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.600]   - We don't have to have the weirdest lights.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.200]   - You have to turn a knob to get your faucet to come on.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.400]   Like a savage-- - Yeah, we tell them,
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.480]   we'll do have to do that.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.120]   - Of Stacey's sitting in there, telling them shades to go up
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.200]   and getting matter and matter and matter and screaming.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.120]   - Shades up!
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.600]   Shades up!
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600]   - And then she goes over.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.440]   - Andrew goes over and goes--
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.440]   - I'm not, I'm not you, Jeff.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.160]   - I don't get that angry about things.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.560]   (laughing)
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   I'm a pretty high threshold about that stuff.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.640]   So yes, I--
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.880]   - She used to folks wave at her kitchen faucet
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.480]   and if water would just come out of it.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.320]   - Oh, I touched it.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.560]   I had missed my touch faucet like nobody's business.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.320]   I actually was like, I was ready to pay $500
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.880]   and install it in my rental house.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.760]   - Did you have the one that you could touch a button
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.480]   that would, like would say two cups exactly would come out?
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.600]   - Yeah, I could tell Madam A to dispense two cups.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.080]   - Dispense two cups of water into my hand, Madam A.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.960]   - And you could program it to do like--
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.480]   - That is Christ life.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.120]   That is like, let there be water.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.680]   - It didn't turn it into one.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.520]   - Oh, well.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.600]   - It's just, it's still water.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.760]   - But you could walk on it.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.040]   That's a mere matter of--
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:50.880]   - That's a mere matter of--
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.640]   - Configuration, yes.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.040]   - Have to do is have a tube going into India.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.640]   - Do you tell Madam A what temperature it should be?
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.080]   - I did not have that setting.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.440]   - You can do it so it's warmer or cooler
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.880]   if you have the right.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.880]   - Madam A, I would love a couple of cups of cool water
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.280]   to gush course.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.440]   - As cool as a morning spring.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.840]   That's how cool I would like to do.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.240]   - The nice thing is you probably could stick
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.040]   all those extra words in and she just go,
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.200]   yeah, here's some cold water.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.040]   - Yeah, I would.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.040]   (laughing)
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.120]   - Yeah, but I just learned somebody,
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.000]   I did a podcast with someone that hasn't been released yet,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.480]   but he was talking about his kid interacts with Madam A
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.960]   and she just says, "Madam A, weather."
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.800]   - Yeah.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.640]   - And I'm like, that works?
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.720]   - Of course it works.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.560]   It's better.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.040]   - Madam A, oh it's so much better.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.800]   - What will the weather weather today?
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.480]   - Especially if you're--
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.960]   - Yeah, if you're very curt with her, it works much better.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.120]   - Yes, 'cause she has to figure out
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.320]   what all those extra words are.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.080]   You humans are so verbose.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:50.920]   - Shh, so robot.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.320]   - Can I have you do it at one and a half X?
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.160]   - Yeah, by the way, that voice appearing
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.680]   from nowhere I should explain his carsten,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.120]   our producer, Karsten Vani.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.440]   'Cause I realize if you're watching video,
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.880]   you're seeing nobody's mouth move when he talks,
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.640]   so that's why.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.600]   - I'm working on making Leo's voice.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.520]   (laughing)
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.640]   - I think we need a Karsten puppet.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.440]   (laughing)
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.280]   - I'll just go on.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.280]   - And Jeff can make it talk.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.120]   That was awesome.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:18.960]   - Let's just move my hand.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.160]   - Yeah, this is my Karsten puppet.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.320]   - You're still in touch with the guys who did DevNo.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.320]   We could just have me like--
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.680]   - Karsten-- - Put me in the suit.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.120]   - We've mentioned this before, but in case you forgot,
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.000]   used to be my handler.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   When I was the robot character on MSNBC's The Sight,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.320]   DevNo, Karsten was the guy that we took two people.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.880]   Actually took three if you include me to do it.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.040]   And what part of me did you do my eyebrows, right?
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.640]   - I did your hair and your eyebrows
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.400]   and all the cameras and lights.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.360]   - That's how we got this job, kids.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.120]   So make sure you stay in school.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.960]   - Stay in school.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.520]   (laughing)
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.880]   - Stay in school. - Does that Harvard degree
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.480]   to work? - Do we have any pictures
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.520]   of DevNo to put up?
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.080]   - Oh, I can do that, sure.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:05.960]   I got many pictures.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.480]   We can even play a little clip if you really want.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.480]   - Video. - Let's do that.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.320]   - Let's do that.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.400]   - I wanna see Karsten's eyebrow.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.600]   - So let out of Brian was talking about Dev the other day.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.440]   - Really?
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.320]   - Yeah. - Someone embarrassed her with it.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.120]   - Yeah, and she played a clip of it.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.360]   - Well, how did she play it on Twitter?
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.800]   - No, he played her.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   - Oh, this is from 1997.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.920]   - Uncle Eel.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.440]   - And let me turn up the sound so you can hear it
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.440]   on the site.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.920]   - Your attention, please.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.920]   Prepare to enter the site.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.680]   - I gave the show great reviews.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.520]   - Did you thank you?
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.840]   - I'm from Sanford's Systems.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.160]   - So, LaDad O'Brien.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.400]   - That sounds like you, Karsten.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.280]   - Hello and welcome to the site for Tuesday, June 10th.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.520]   These stories making high tech news today.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.360]   - And now--
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.720]   - We're in the show where we turn to Dev.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.120]   - Would that be the high point?
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:56.960]   - Low point.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.800]   - Low point.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.640]   - That'd be where exactly--
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.800]   - Oh, you're leaving it so open for me.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.840]   I can't even go there.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.960]   - I like to give you the opportunity to slam.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.200]   - So she's staring, not at a strangely attractive guy
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.120]   with purple hair, but at a green dot on the wall.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.160]   I am in another room, and the other side of the studio
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.120]   surrounded by sound blankets, so it's sweltering hot.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.240]   Karsten and Christine are manipulating my hair
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.640]   and eyebrows, and I'm talking in a funny voice,
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.720]   wearing a rubber suit, like a wetsuit,
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   with dots taped to it.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.640]   It was sensors.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.480]   - It was sensors.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.280]   - All of this because you have a face for radio?
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.560]   - This was because the network decided
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.000]   I should not be on TV.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.840]   - Yes.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.360]   - And they said, well, 'cause they,
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.040]   originally my was promised, you know,
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.920]   managing editor of the show and all that,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.880]   and regular spot every week, and every day it was daily.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.840]   And then they decided, no, we don't want you on TV,
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.600]   so here, wear this rubber suit.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.960]   - That is so harsh.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.720]   - You know, network television.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.640]   - But so far you have yet to take me up on this.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.480]   You're so polite.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.560]   - So that I hated me.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.800]   She hated you, you just make me crazy.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.160]   Hey, I got a great bit for you.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.160]   This is a great--
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.680]   - Hey, you want to say that?
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.520]   - Hey.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.840]   - Hey, I think it's your attention.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.680]   Hey, hey, I know you're not exactly thrilled to be here,
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.680]   so I'm just trying to get your attention.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.680]   - I'm thrilled to be here.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.200]   - Oh yeah, right, yes, you're here.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.720]   - I'm a little pollution guy.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.160]   - Kind of.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.480]   She sees her career flashing before her own.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.320]   - That was basically it.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.360]   You get the attention.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.720]   It wasn't exactly moonlighting.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.000]   It wasn't exactly Sibyl Shepherd and Bruce Willis.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.840]   It was, you know--
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.800]   - Every time you're out of town,
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.240]   I've been on that show, you know.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.040]   Every time you're out of town,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.080]   you should be dev know.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.320]   - I should just do the show like this.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.160]   - You virtually owe.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.000]   - In a virtual.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.280]   - Okay, we're really digressing, but I will digress.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.360]   There's a guy named Greg Panos,
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.920]   who worked at the company that did this character.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.440]   And in 1997, this was state of the art.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.640]   You couldn't do this because--
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.800]   - I don't know why you'd want to,
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.280]   but that's another question.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.480]   - Nobody asked that question.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.640]   You could do it after the fact in rendering,
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.920]   but you couldn't do it in real time.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.640]   We were doing this live in real time.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   And so it took a half million dollar
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.920]   Silicon graphics on X-Works station running specials.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.240]   - Silicon graphics.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.560]   - Remember them, SGI?
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.400]   - The SGI, wow.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.240]   - It was purple, it was beautiful.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.280]   I wish I had that SGI, although it has a tenth
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.680]   of the power in my smartphone,
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.880]   but it was running software from a company called Protezoa.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.800]   And Panos was an expert in all this 3D stuff.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.560]   I met him maybe five or six years ago in the men's room
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.680]   at a Webberium Awards.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.640]   - That was probably extraneous information.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.640]   And he said, you know, we could do what we did with that SGI
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.680]   today with any modern PC.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.080]   We were just about to build our studios.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.240]   And I said, Greg, it would be really cool if we could do
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.520]   some sort of thing instead of having Jeff Jarvis
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.880]   in a TV screen and Stacy in a TV screen as they are today.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.280]   - Or we could be DevNol.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.120]   - We could animate you without wearing a suit
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.040]   with its standard PC,
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.760]   scan your, is he actually--
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.200]   - Do you have my Bitmoji?
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.160]   - Yeah, be like a Bitmoji or a Memoji for Mapple.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.760]   And Stacy, you and I could be deep fakes.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.960]   - Yeah, you could do that with their Note 10 now.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.320]   - We could do it with a smartphone.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.000]   So, and I thought it would be really cool to do it
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.240]   so that you'd be actually sitting at the table
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.240]   in roughly equivalent 3D renderings of yourselves,
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.440]   but you know what, this works fine.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.920]   - Are there pictures of you in the rubber suit?
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.680]   - Oh, I don't know, Carson, did you take any pictures?
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.680]   - I don't wanna see those.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.960]   - It's pretty funny, it's like a wet suit.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.240]   Basically, it is a wet suit.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.400]   And I also have a headband on.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.520]   And how did they do my, how did they lip sync my mouth?
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.440]   There was no camera on me, right?
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.120]   - It was just sound.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:53.960]   - It was just sound.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.320]   - You just flapped to the camera.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.520]   - Which is why the lip sync isn't very good.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.440]   If you look at it, it's actually pretty, pretty bad.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.280]   - Just volume, I call you in my phone.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.280]   - I'm not like, when, I remember.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.760]   - But I guess that to some of the content
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.840]   that providers weren't so thrilled.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.680]   - The voice is very irritated.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.040]   That was my creation.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.520]   - Yeah, I can tell all you.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.600]   - I just didn't want anybody to think it was me, honestly.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.440]   - Yeah.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.640]   - So it could have been any number of things.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.880]   I should have made him like weirdly British or something.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.320]   Or, oh, I should just make us into deep fakes.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.160]   - Yeah.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.320]   - Well, that would be, you see the New York Times.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.960]   - We'll save that for the end of the show.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.800]   - We're saving that for the world.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   - Well, they're okay, we'll keep that there.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.400]   - Okay, is that the thing you're saving?
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.080]   - That's the thing I'm saving for the end of the show.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.680]   - Because we weren't able to show it last week.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.520]   - Yes.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.720]   - Because we didn't want to get taken down on YouTube.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.560]   - Yes.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.560]   - So that's, but then-
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.560]   - Just, we'll get there.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.400]   We'll get there.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.240]   - You wait, Laurel.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.800]   - So I have some more Google home devices
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.640]   if we want to talk about this.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.240]   - Get us back on track, we have-
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.400]   - It's that or Bedminster, one or the other.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.440]   So you go ahead.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.520]   - They've added some other stuff, which is Carsten.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.280]   I may be back to the 3A.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.280]   So, CNET published a story about the features in the Google.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.200]   - Oh, I'm going to screw this up.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.560]   Nest, Max?
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.400]   - Mini.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.240]   - Max?
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.480]   No, okay, so there's that one.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.840]   There's the news that there's going to be a Nest Mini.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.680]   So-
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.160]   - With a built-in law mount, better sound in an aux jack,
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.680]   which actually is great.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.520]   - The aux jack is-
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.600]   - That is, you mount any of your talking things.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.520]   - My wife doesn't like it when I mount things.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.720]   So I pretty much don't.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.320]   - It's one of the most popular questions.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.880]   I'm going to go right over that.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.720]   I had just to.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.560]   - Yeah.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.800]   - But it's one of the most popular questions
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.360]   we get at the show is-
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.840]   - She says it hurts the woodwork.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.000]   What are you thinking?
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.520]   - So there's origin makes some lovely devices
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.680]   if you want to like ceiling or wall mount a Google
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.280]   or an Echo device.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.600]   Anyway, but-
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   - I'm sorry, I really threw you.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.000]   I apologize.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.400]   I really apologize.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:03.040]   - The Google Max apparently is going to have the solely chip
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.040]   in it, which means I can use gesture there.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.040]   - Oh.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:07.880]   So this is-
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.360]   - It seems I don't have to buy a four.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.000]   - This is the new thing coming in the Pixel 4.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.840]   Soly is-
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.000]   - Who did it?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.840]   What?
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.560]   - So the Google Nest Max.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.520]   - I know, I'm saying that it was previously announced
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.000]   in this or leaked in the Pixel 4 phone,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.040]   which is coming out in a month or two.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.200]   But you're saying they're going to put the same array.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.040]   And what is it?
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.400]   It's a 3D sensing camera.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.000]   - Yeah, so CNET put a story out today.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.320]   So they're saying it's going,
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.720]   the 10 inch display is going to have,
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.440]   well done, I'm going to go through there.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.600]   - This is really interesting news.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.440]   - Nest Cam, facial recognition,
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:49.240]   and it's supposed to be able to follow you around.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.720]   Kind of like the facial key thing, portal.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.480]   And then it's also going to have gesture control.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.680]   - Let me play the YouTube video that Google put out of.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.880]   - See, now that the boss is back, he can play them.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.400]   - Well, yeah, I mean, so see she's doing gestures.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.840]   So this isn't actually a rumor.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.840]   This is Google already announced.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.680]   - Right.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.920]   - These features in the Pixel 4.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.680]   So you can use gestures,
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.920]   'cause it's a 3D sensing camera, right?
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.160]   But what could you do with it
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.640]   so it could follow you around with a Max
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.480]   as you making phone calls?
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.040]   - So you could stop music playback.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.280]   If I could catch you. - Oh, by saying no, okay, good.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.800]   - No, well, no, you're like-
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.960]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm waving at it.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.240]   - I was like, you don't have to say it, that's beautiful.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.080]   - Yeah.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.160]   - And yeah, so now I'm like,
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.560]   hey, hey, I'm going to try this out.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.520]   So I still get solely,
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.800]   and I can buy the Pixel 3A,
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.840]   which I thought Karstom would appreciate.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.360]   - So the solely is part of the-
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.160]   - You can wait until the 4 comes out though,
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.200]   just in case.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.200]   - I really want this new whole Max.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   - What are you wanting for?
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.200]   You want to give the,
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.440]   don't you want to give the 2 to-
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.760]   - Today is my child's birthday.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.120]   I have to get rid of my-
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.720]   - Wow. - Wow.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.040]   - I told her she had to be patient.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:02.880]   - She's patient.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.840]   - But I completely agree with you.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.280]   I don't want to gesture to my phone,
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.040]   but I do want to gesture to a-
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.600]   - Yeah, you're telling her whatever-
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.160]   - A best-tastic device.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.040]   - Or it's having no worrying.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.840]   - This is a much better place for solely, frankly.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.920]   Did they say when this is going to be?
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.760]   - This is September.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.280]   This comes out in September.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.240]   - So Google's going to do one announcement
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.360]   with all of this stuff right, probably, right?
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.040]   - Yeah, I think, is it the ninth?
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.400]   Did I make that up for someone?
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.480]   - Of one September?
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   - Yeah, so the tenth is when Apple's expected
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.480]   to announce its new iPhone.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.680]   So the ninth would be a very interesting day to announce it.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.080]   That's a Monday.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.960]   That would be very interesting.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.440]   That would be really interesting.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.280]   - Maybe it's not-
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.120]   - Maybe I just need to get-
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.960]   - Also double-edged sword,
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.120]   because you only get one day in your news cycle.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.800]   - Oh no, so the Nest Hub Max will hit stores
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.960]   on September 9th.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.880]   It's going to be $229.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.720]   - Is that it?
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.560]   That's it.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.000]   - This is it?
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.840]   - Yeah.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.920]   September 9th.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.200]   - I want it.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.880]   I already signed up on the website,
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.600]   but will you get an email?
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.040]   What does that mean?
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.360]   - Well, maybe they'll give me money off my pixel thingy.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.360]   I wish, you know, does Google do the thing
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.600]   where if I turn in another one of their devices,
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.960]   I get like Amazon?
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.920]   - Yeah, that's probably 35 cents.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.840]   - Samsung does it, yeah.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.120]   - Amazon gives you like 10 bucks for old dots
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.680]   and stuff like that.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.200]   - So this comes out of ATAP,
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.240]   the Advanced Technology Group and Projects Group at Google.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.680]   They've been working, this, remember Project Era
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.120]   that you were also disappointed about,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.840]   the modular phone that they abandoned?
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.160]   Tango was also out of that.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.280]   It's a radar chip, the solely chip.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.760]   So it's a single chip solution, it's radar.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.840]   I'm really curious.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.000]   - You're using 60 gigahertz.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.920]   - So it's not doing what Apple's array does,
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.840]   which is paint red dots,
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.120]   infrared dots on my face.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.440]   - No, it doesn't do that.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.080]   And it's not using time of flight,
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.440]   it's using--
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.840]   - 'Cause that's what's on the new Note 10
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   is a time of flight sensor.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.560]   - Yeah, think of this as radar,
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.760]   yeah, think of this as sonar with radio waves
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.680]   as opposed to sound like-- - It's almost as huge.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.520]   Sorry, the Google Nest Hub Max,
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.560]   now on the Google Store,
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.000]   is it was doing everything you're saying it's doing.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.200]   - You should-- - Google.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.840]   Did you finish your question?
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.200]   - Oh, I turned on my, my device.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.760]   - Seriously, what is it?
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.800]   - Responding.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.000]   Stop, Google, stop.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.360]   - Time legend woke up.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.480]   - Okay, Google, stop.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.960]   So, so--
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.280]   - Jeff, there is the-- - All of you, stop.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.120]   - Let me answer your question before you ask it.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.440]   There is the Google Nest Home Max.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.760]   - Right. - Google Home Max
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.080]   that is available now that does not do this.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.920]   The Google Nest Hub Max that is coming out.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.760]   - I have the Home Hub, which is the original little one,
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.240]   and I love, but this does not have a camera at all.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.920]   One of the reasons it's in my bedroom,
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.120]   it's just basically a slideshow that I could talk to.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.840]   But it's like yesterday, I said,
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.760]   "Set a weekday alarm for 7.30 a.m."
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.560]   And every, I mean, there's little things like that,
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.800]   they're just so useful.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.040]   - Oh yeah, I love having-- - I really like it.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.080]   So, I won't put it in the bedroom 'cause of that,
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:08.960]   but I think of the kitchen,
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.240]   that's a perfect kitchen device.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.080]   And it's a bigger screen so you could watch stuff on it.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.560]   - Yeah, Kevin, Kevin, I know, watches lots of stuff.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.040]   Every now and then, my daughter will come in.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.760]   I only have the Google one in my office
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.560]   because no one in my family uses Google
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.520]   when Madam A is available.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.360]   - Yeah. - But--
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.480]   - I'm thinking of shifting everything to Google.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.280]   I have both, but I think that's why I was thinking
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.640]   maybe I should replace the ring, which works better with Echo.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.080]   - And I will say the doorbell, the Hello Doorbell--
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:38.920]   - Hello, hello.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.720]   - Is awesome on, 'cause you could set it up
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.360]   so when someone rings your doorbell,
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.920]   it just pops up on that screen.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.680]   - That's it, okay.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.560]   - And it's pretty handy. - That's what I want.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.160]   - So I'm thinking, and this is, of course,
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.080]   what Google's hoping we will all think,
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.680]   maybe it's time to become an all Google home.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.960]   - Yes, I wish I wish I could be all one or all the other.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.600]   My brain would like that.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.400]   - Doesn't everything, I mean,
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.080]   the Lillutrons would work with Google or no.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.440]   You have to have Echo for a lot.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.360]   - No, everything works with Amazon.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.080]   - No, Lillutron works with both.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.960]   Hue lights work with both.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.120]   Almost everything.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.080]   June Oven does not work with Google.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.840]   - Wait a minute, you can command your toaster oven
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.640]   with your Amazon Echo.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.480]   - You don't.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.800]   - Yeah, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.040]   Why would you not do that?
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.120]   - I didn't know I could to be honest.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.680]   - Oh, okay, I was like, it's really handy.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.640]   - Okay, so there you go.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:37.920]   There's one thing I can't use with an all Google house.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   But that's crazy, 'cause--
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.160]   - You're apparently not doing it anyway, so.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.760]   - Yeah, irony of it is the June Oven's running Android.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.960]   - Yeah, I don't.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.120]   I'm trying to see if they, maybe they have it now.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.200]   - So here is the video.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.320]   I think this is two or three years old of Project Soli.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.360]   I've forgotten we saw this, we talked about it.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.200]   - I love that.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.760]   - Look at the size of the chip.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.600]   Remember, yeah, I remember you were very excited, Stacey.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.040]   Look at the size of this original chip.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.720]   The idea is it's bouncing radar waves off of this hand
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.960]   and I don't know what it's doing.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.880]   Oh, so now gestures, it can interpret--
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.840]   - That's the Carsten puppet, Josh.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.960]   - It's almost like a wave form
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.200]   that it can interpret like sound.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.880]   So you can see the value of it.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.920]   You can see how, oh, well, I understand sound waves.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.360]   This is just another kind of wave.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.120]   - Yep. - Very interesting.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.480]   Oh, I'm excited.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.720]   I wanna get this thing. - Good.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.280]   - Yeah.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.200]   And then I guess I have to get more Nest cameras.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.880]   A hello doorbell.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.720]   What else is it?
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.240]   - The Nest by Yale lock.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.280]   - Nest by Yale. - Yell by Nest lock.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.760]   - See, I really have misgivings,
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.120]   especially we just learned now
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.840]   there's a new Bluetooth attack called knob
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.800]   that makes Bluetooth supremely hackable
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:56.000]   because you can command Bluetooth to have a password
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   of one byte, which means there's only 256 choices, period,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.560]   which means it's easy to brute force.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.320]   And I worry about having a Bluetooth enabled door lock
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.000]   for that reason.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.400]   - So here's the deal.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.760]   - Bluetooth is not very secure.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.600]   - Here's my philosophy on door locks.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.520]   - Okay. - If you have like a quick set
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.800]   or some of the lower end door locks out there today,
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.960]   you can open it with a screwdriver.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.400]   (laughing)
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.720]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.600]   - A lock is really only a serving suggestion anyway.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.880]   Any idiot could get in by kicking a door in
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.800]   or going around back or breaking the glass.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.280]   So you require a minimal bit of connector.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.320]   - The lock is merely a suggestion,
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.400]   please don't go in my house.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.480]   It's more a social thing.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.320]   - That's one.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.400]   - Now there are places where connected locks don't make sense.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.840]   And actually hotels are one because you can,
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.840]   there's a huge motivation to easily hack into it
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.600]   'cause your pay offs much higher
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.440]   than coming into like a single house.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.760]   - So it's like honestly, yeah.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.840]   - If I could replace a deadbolt with this lock.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.520]   - It's a nice lock.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.640]   - Is it?
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.280]   - I have had that lock installed in my house.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.680]   It is a nice lock.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.520]   - Somewhat concerned about the spousal acceptance factor
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.680]   on this, but the advantage is if we're not home,
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.520]   we can open it.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.760]   So for instance, we had to put off the plumber
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.440]   the other day 'cause nobody was home.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.960]   But if I had, I could have just said,
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.640]   oh yeah, I'll open the door for you, go on in.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.080]   - Yeah, and then you have your cameras monitoring him
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.560]   to make sure he doesn't do anything weird.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.680]   I guess he's-- - No, we like this guy.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.000]   He's distressed with it.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.880]   - Well then the guess.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.080]   - Wow, okay, that's tempting.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.600]   But then you have to also have a Nest Connect
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.760]   or a Nest Guard.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.960]   - So with the lock, because it's Bluetooth,
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.440]   it needs Wi-Fi back out if you wanna have remote control
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.840]   and that's what that device does.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.240]   You plug it in. - Okay.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.240]   - And it also-- - It's on my Wi-Fi, right?
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.200]   - It's on my Wi-Fi.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.320]   - It's on your Wi-Fi and then it talks to the Bluetooth.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.800]   - Okay, the other thing is it has batteries.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.480]   - The lock does, yes. - Yeah.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.840]   Of course it does.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.040]   How do it get charged?
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.280]   - The nice thing about a doorbell is most doorbells have power.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.240]   - If you want a Wi-Fi doorbell that does solar charged,
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.440]   Hampton's-- - No, solar--
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.480]   - Hampton-- - Yeah, they have a solar--
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.800]   Yeah, yeah, if this exists.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.720]   - It's not a big solar panel.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.160]   - It's a little big, but it's not as big as you think it is.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.640]   And it's auxiliary.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:33.640]   So it's Hampton products and it is called the Array Lock.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.480]   - They are on-- - They are on, if they--
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:39.720]   - If the battery dies, how do you get in your house?
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.720]   - It depends on the lock.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.480]   Some locks, if you take a nine volt battery, it'll--
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.320]   - Yeah, that's what they say.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.040]   You could charge it up with a nine volt battery.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.240]   Or use a screwdriver.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.840]   There's the solar, that's not that big.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.760]   That's not that big at all.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   - Yes, see, there you go.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:00.640]   - Yeah, 'cause it doesn't need a lot of juice.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.720]   I would like a lock like that that has a keyhole.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.080]   See, it doesn't look like the Yale has a keyhole.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:06.920]   - It does not.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:07.760]   - That's the override.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.400]   If you can't get in, you use a keyhole.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.440]   But this one doesn't have that.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.960]   - So maybe you should go for the Array Lock.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:23.920]   - I love having an IOT/5G/Qalcom chip guru on the show.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.800]   Don't you, Jeff?
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.640]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.120]   - Jeff, yes.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.440]   - Yeah.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.280]   - Okay.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.200]   - Well, now we can talk about other things.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.480]   - Let's take a break and we will talk about other things.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.120]   But first, a word from Monday.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:42.160]   I know it's Wednesday, but Monday.com
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:46.200]   is gonna turn every day into a great day in your office.
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.720]   We just started using Monday.com
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.080]   for a show planning for iOS today.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.320]   And Micah and I are just going,
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.280]   this is great, this is great.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.440]   Monday.com helps teams manage work and meet deadlines,
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.400]   but also they like to call it a culture builds,
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.680]   a culture of transparency.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.080]   Because everything is known.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.680]   So when you're working on a team,
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.240]   a lot of times there's stuff you don't know,
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.000]   you're not sure about, but with Monday,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.480]   you'll be motivated to put everything
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.440]   in the Monday dashboard.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.800]   You can manage all your core business activities
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:18.880]   in one place.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.640]   I mean, everything, they have all kinds of 10 plates,
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.440]   but you can create your own as well.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.800]   High level roadmaps down a specific day-to-day,
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.160]   even hour-to-hour tasks.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.720]   Monday.com is so cool.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.360]   Tailor, any template to your team's workflow,
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.640]   automate them with reminders, notifications.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.200]   Of course, you can use Dropbox or Google Drive
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.880]   for the file upload directly from your computer.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:47.000]   65,000 teams are now using Monday.com
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.320]   to get things done.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.120]   I asked them, why do you call it Monday?
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.240]   'Cause we want Mondays to be a good day.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:56.200]   The day you're going in to work is a good day.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.360]   The discovery uses it, that's pretty cool.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.800]   We just started using it, I'm loving it.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.360]   It's great for big teams and little,
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.800]   and you can think from two freelancers
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.040]   working together to thousands,
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.240]   collaborating across the globe.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.840]   It replaces a lot of stuff, excel files and whiteboards,
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.000]   and most importantly, from my point of view,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.600]   long meetings.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.120]   There's accountability, you could say,
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.960]   who's in charge of what, whose job this is?
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.560]   There's My Week, which is a great way
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.720]   to see what you need to do.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.040]   You'll never miss another deadline.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.560]   It's kind of almost a personal assistant for you and your team.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.120]   Stay in control anywhere you go
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.160]   with a Monday.com mobile app too.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.040]   You've got a web-based dashboard,
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.600]   you've got a Monday mobile app on your phone.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.440]   I just think this is so cool.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.760]   Mike and I, we're using, believe it or not,
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.440]   Google Spreadsheets to manage the show.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.240]   This is not only more pretty, it's much more effective.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.360]   It just gets the job done.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.400]   To learn more and start your 14-day free trial,
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.760]   go to monday, m-o-n-d-a-y.com/twig,

[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.800]   By the way, I do know a lot of households
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.320]   and families that use Mondays, not just for work,
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.400]   although it's intended for work.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.240]   Turns out, sometimes running a household's
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.160]   kind of like work too.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.320]   monday.com/twig, try it free for two weeks,
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.360]   you're gonna love it.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:22.000]   And we thank Monday for supporting this week.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:22.840]   And Google.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:30.400]   - I guess we could do a little. - You can do a little.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.560]   - Yeah, go ahead.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.480]   - Is the MIT Media Lab story?
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.320]   - Yeah.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.840]   I don't know what to think about this.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.640]   In fact, we have booked Joey Ito for triangulation
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.280]   for an interview with Denise Howell.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.120]   And I've just been reading all this.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.240]   So, summarize, Jeff, what's the deal?
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.680]   - So, Joey Ito, who's very well known.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.760]   - And by the way, a great guy, I know him.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.480]   I have a lot of respect for him.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.840]   - He is, he was one of the pioneers of social,
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.280]   what we would now think of as social media
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.840]   going way back, and he became, without a graduate degree,
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.000]   he became director of the MIT Media Lab.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.960]   - And everybody who knows MIT Media Lab knows
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.960]   how important that is to everything we do these days.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.720]   It all came in the Media Lab.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:25.720]   - After Epstein killed himself, allegedly.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:29.600]   You know, had to come out with an apology saying that
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   five years after Epstein was, or was he?
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.520]   - He was convicted.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.160]   - He was convicted.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:42.760]   - And convicted sex offender for sex of minors.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.880]   - Of children, of children.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:49.520]   Five years after that, Ito went to events with him.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.200]   Raised money for the school from him,
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   and even raised money for the companies in which
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.760]   Ito and his fund invest.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.360]   - And visited several of Epstein's residences,
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.640]   and of course-- - Yes.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.320]   - The residences are where these things happened.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.120]   - There was also a story that,
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.400]   the founder of the MIT Media Lab, Marvin Minsky,
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.840]   who's now departed, in one set of allegations,
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   was the received, I don't know how to say this,
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:27.880]   allegedly had sex with minors under the ages of Epstein.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.080]   So all this is roiling around.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.720]   So Joy Eater writes an apology.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.280]   It doesn't say how much money he got from the school.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.560]   It doesn't say how much money he got for his companies.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.040]   - He does say, let me read what he says,
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.240]   'cause it's important.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.280]   I want you to know in all my interactions with Epstein,
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.720]   I was never involved in, never heard him talk about,
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.320]   never saw any evidence of the horrific acts
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.320]   that he was accused of.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.040]   That said, I take full responsibility for my error
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.320]   and judgment, I'm deeply sorry to the survivors,
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.560]   to the Media Lab, and the MIT community
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.400]   for bringing such a person into our network.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.760]   - And people are, I think you can take that
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.920]   at face value and believe that,
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.000]   but it's still why were you having any association
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   whatsoever with the child molester?
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.440]   - He was a convicted sex offender,
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.120]   child molester. - He was a child molester.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.120]   He was convicted. - So last night,
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.240]   Ethan Zuckerman, who heads one of the centers
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:19.120]   at the Media Lab, had sent a letter of apology
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.360]   to people he was involved with about this
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.760]   and said that he was going to leave at the end of this term,
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.040]   see through his work this year,
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.320]   and then leaked out to the Washington Globe.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.840]   And so he has resigned in protest,
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.840]   another scholar there who's also associated
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.160]   with the associate with Cornell,
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.840]   has resigned and is taking his work out.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:41.680]   Edo is also on the boards of the MacArthur Foundation,
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.920]   the Knight Foundation, and the New York Times.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.760]   So this is a story that's just roiling right now in my world.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.520]   - And it was the Boston Globe that broke this, by the way,
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.360]   not the New York Times, I should point out.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.800]   - No, no, the New York Times did write a story
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:00.400]   about his apology, but I complained that the headline said,
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.920]   MIT Media Director, First and College,
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.560]   I was representing the connections.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.800]   It didn't say New York Times Board Director.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   Some people, some people, some trolls came after me
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.400]   and about that, but you can bet the New York Post said,
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.920]   New York Times. - They sure did.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.200]   - Yeah, apologize. - Yeah, it's in the headline.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.560]   - New York Times Board member apologizes
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.040]   for Epstein-Ties on the Post.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.840]   - This is all around us, it's a big story,
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.400]   and my world is a story in media and technology world.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.360]   Stacy, you were trying to say it.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.360]   - No, I was just gonna point out that there are plenty
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.280]   of convicted sex offenders.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:35.760]   It's hard, like, I'm not excusing Epstein,
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.600]   I am not excusing the Media Lab.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.360]   I will say that there are probably people you interact with
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.760]   on a daily basis that may have had similar problems
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.960]   that you just haven't looked up.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.960]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.520]   Everybody knew what Epstein had been doing.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.360]   - Everybody knew what Epstein had been doing.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:56.520]   - And that's the, I mean, did everyone know?
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.320]   - Absolutely.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.920]   Yeah, let me say this.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.880]   The I Have Sympathy, if you've,
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.400]   we had a case where we gave an honor to Charlie Rose.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.000]   - Yeah, you didn't know of that, the Me Too Show.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:09.840]   - And we didn't know about it,
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.680]   and we withdrew it when the news came out, right?
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.040]   We had no knowledge.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.920]   I have sympathy for those who accept money
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.240]   or give honors to those who later turn out
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.000]   to have had something bad in their past.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.280]   In this case, oh yeah, and I also know
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.040]   that when giving honors and accepting money,
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.200]   you do a background check on people.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.520]   That's what happens.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.280]   And so that is standard process.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.960]   - And I should point out, there are people convicted,
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.280]   convicted sex offenders for peeing in public.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.760]   But when you do the background research
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.160]   and you find out he was convicted for pedophilia.
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.880]   - Right.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.240]   - And that his, that the press had nicknamed
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:48.080]   his private jet the Lolita Express.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:53.280]   Are you so desperate for money that you say, oh well, you know.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:57.360]   - And Ethan Zuckerman, in 2014, Ethan said,
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.000]   I have a great deal of respect for Ethan
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.880]   and I complimented him last night on his principles on this.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:06.680]   Joey tried to get Ethan to meet Epstein in 2014.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.240]   Ethan refused.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.080]   - Yeah, Ethan knew.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.000]   - And Joey, you should not meet him.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.160]   So Joey knew too.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.440]   - Okay.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.400]   Well then that's yet, then that's very different.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.240]   I have this--
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.080]   - Full disclosure.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:20.760]   - I knew Galen Maxwell.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.920]   I worked for her father.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:23.760]   - She was the--
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.600]   - Well, Maxwell is an enabler.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.680]   - An enabler of all this.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:27.520]   - Right.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.360]   - So just full disclosure there,
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.200]   I had very little contacts with her.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.000]   So one thing that's becoming rapidly,
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.080]   becoming very, very clear is that Epstein
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.600]   was very active after his conviction
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:42.600]   in spreading philanthropy and getting to know people
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:48.360]   and the connections to Epstein are everywhere.
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:52.800]   So, and this was his MO, I believe.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.960]   That was part of the deal, was this is how I rehabilitate
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.140]   my reputation.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.600]   - So, what would you do, Jeff?
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.520]   We have an interview scheduled with Joey.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.240]   I was surprised the Media Lab has not canceled it.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.080]   The Media Lab is very much our beat.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.280]   It's something we wanna cover.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.120]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.360]   - Did all this videos will do the interview.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:16.200]   I told Denise, I'm gonna leave this up to you,
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.120]   but you absolutely have to bring it up.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:22.760]   It could be, but now this interview
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.920]   is a whole different story.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:25.760]   - It's true.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.600]   - And that's okay.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:27.440]   I mean, you can't--
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.280]   - Yeah, that's not bad, that's true.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.120]   - That's true, is it?
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.680]   - Yeah.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.920]   (sighs)
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:38.480]   - What would I do?
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.440]   - If you ask him about, I mean, I would bring him on
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.600]   and ask him about it and--
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.920]   - You have to do that much anyway.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.480]   - You have to have him talk about it.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.320]   - It's fine to do that.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.440]   I don't have a problem with that.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.200]   I mean, but you also--
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.560]   - I think that's similar to all these points.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:51.560]   There are these things that he has not said before.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:52.880]   - That's what I told Denise.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.800]   I said, of course, we should bring him on,
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.480]   but if you do, now you are,
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:02.800]   and nobody here at Twit is anxious to play the role
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.600]   of Mike Wallace and ask the hard questions.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.520]   It's not what we do, it's not what we need to do.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.960]   Well, it is if I'm asking Microsoft or,
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.960]   you know, if I see you tell why--
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.960]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but in terms of personal--
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.040]   - But this kind of thing--
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.000]   - That's a news story, not a tech story.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.160]   - Triangulation is not--
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.840]   - That's not the venue for it.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.840]   - No, not the hard news.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.400]   - And I don't want to put Denise in that position,
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.400]   so I'm leaving it up to her.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.200]   - Yeah, I do believe that if we interview him,
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.680]   we have to ask the tough questions.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.160]   - I also would do some, like we're beforehand,
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:33.920]   I mean, I would talk to Jenny Jordan,
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.560]   who has talked about this a lot on Twitter,
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.760]   and is angry about this.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.320]   I would talk to some folks beforehand
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:42.600]   to get the perspective,
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.440]   and let them know that that perspective
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.600]   is gonna be represented.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.440]   - Good.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.520]   - The other thing that happened around this,
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.000]   the whole Epstein story is,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.520]   'cause it's a bit up our alley.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.640]   I don't know if you saw there was a picture
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.000]   of the Lenmax well, the Unabler, or the Legend of Neighbor.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.720]   Supposedly, in that burger, in LA,
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.440]   and then it came out this week that the photo was faked.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:11.040]   And it was fed to the New York Post by an Epstein lawyer.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.920]   This whole thing is just deep fakes a little bit.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.480]   - So this is a fake picture.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.040]   - If you look at the, well, if you look at the back,
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.040]   the bus shelter there, for some reason,
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:24.840]   they changed the movie being advertised in that bus shelter.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.760]   - Wow.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.360]   - It's the lawyer's dog.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:30.960]   They were trying to act like it was her dog.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.920]   - So it's, wow.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.240]   - Yeah, it's all just.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:38.040]   - Wow.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.280]   - Speaking of deep fakes, and don't worry, Carson,
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.000]   I'm not going there.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.760]   My friend, Claire Wardle, who heads First Draft,
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.400]   which is an amazing organization that brings together
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:52.080]   newsrooms to deal with misinformation, disinformation.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:55.120]   She did a great video on deep fakes with the New York Times,
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.320]   because it's not a YouTube video,
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.720]   it's on the bottom of the rundown.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.160]   I actually think you'd enjoy watching it for a minute,
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:03.200]   because it's also not techno panicky.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.880]   And here it is.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.520]   - Talking to you about a new technology
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.560]   that's affecting famous people.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.680]   Remember when Obama called Trump a dick?
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.760]   - Complete dick.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.440]   - Or a time he had actually unwrapped.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:18.280]   - 'Cause I'm always that naked.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.560]   - Or when Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonated himself.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.080]   - The back of this, the bombing deal.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.080]   - The back of this.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.000]   - Deep fake?
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:24.960]   Deep fake?
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:25.800]   Deep fake.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.080]   - Gotta be kidding.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.240]   - That's my favorite, by the way.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.080]   - It's a deep fake too.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:29.920]   - I have paused that for a minute.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.400]   - I'm not a Dell, but I am an internet man.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.440]   In online minute, people like--
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.280]   - Isn't that great?
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.560]   - Wait a minute, I thought that was a Dell.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:37.640]   - Oh, it was.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.200]   - It was, it was Claire Wardle.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.680]   (gasps)
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.360]   Okay, so we've been preparing the world for this
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.720]   for some time now.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:46.560]   - Yeah.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.400]   - And Photoshop fakes like that.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.240]   - Exactly.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.000]   - But Maxwell, this has been going on for decades.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.920]   People's so dumb that, well, I don't know
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.800]   what we're gonna do.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.480]   We just can't believe your eyes anymore.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.600]   No video. - That's hard.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:04.880]   Every part of our brain trusts what we see.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:05.720]   - Yeah.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.560]   - I mean, it's--
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.560]   - Well, we believe-- - It's what
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.400]   mirages work.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.560]   - People believe everything they read on the internet, right?
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.000]   - Well, no, that's, I feel like people,
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.760]   I will say my daughter has already learned how to spot
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:21.760]   Photoshop fakes and in ways that are highly sophisticated.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.720]   Like she looks for like--
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.560]   - Oh, that's really good.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.880]   - Cinching in and like-- - Yeah, good.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.160]   - Weird misalignments.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.680]   - She takes pleasure in that, right?
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.000]   In Finc-- - Yeah, and it's instinctive
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.080]   in a way that--
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.800]   - And for now, deep fakes are, you look at them,
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.800]   there's something a little odd about them,
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.360]   but that's not gonna last long.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.360]   - So the question is-- - And if you're not being--
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.920]   - Yeah, can you, can we find things that as humans,
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.480]   we can see and say, oh, but the other thing is,
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.840]   even though we know things are fake,
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.760]   they still have the power to influence us and that's,
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.040]   that's just part of being human.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.120]   It's kind of like funky smells, right?
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:04.040]   There is a visceral reaction to visual stimuli that really--
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.200]   - Our lizard range-- - Can change.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.840]   - Can change. - Yes, I just saw that.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.040]   I saw it with my own eyes. - So I'm--
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.320]   - That's a phrase. - I'm listening to--
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.400]   Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow."
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.160]   - Yeah, what a good book. - Mm-hmm.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:19.640]   - It is, it's dense, but yeah, it's that instantaneous
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:24.520]   instinctual brain, system one-- - I saw it with my own eyes.
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:26.720]   - And it just reacts like that.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.480]   That's how we do this quickly.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:30.160]   That's how we defend ourselves, doing all kinds of stuff,
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.880]   but yeah, it doesn't bother to think things through.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:36.080]   That has to be triggered as a separate system.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:38.720]   And so, I wonder how you'd remake media
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.240]   and including journalism with that in mind.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:43.960]   With knowing that there's a--
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.320]   'Cause what are the propaganda story?
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.200]   What are the bad guys doing?
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.560]   They're going to that instinctual thing.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:52.040]   They're trying to get the oxytocin, oxytocin,
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.880]   flowing. - Yes, oxytocin.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.560]   - It feels good to be angry, I'm angry.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.960]   And I can make you angry.
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.320]   And actually, that didn't feel good.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.120]   - No, that's dopamine.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:02.840]   - Oh yeah.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.080]   Oxytocin's the love, Greg.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.080]   - Oxytocin's what you get when you hug a kid
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.160]   or you just hit a baby or you pick a dog.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.200]   - And you hug that last longer than--
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.160]   - By the way, did you see Keanu Reeves
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.200]   stopped this robbery at a 7-Eleven?
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.320]   This is kind of amazing.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.920]   He's signing an autograph.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.720]   - An amazing man.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.320]   - Yeah, I mean, Keanu is got--
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.560]   Oh my God, did you see that?
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.680]   The guy pulled out a gun?
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.840]   Keanu, what are you gonna do?
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.080]   Keanu, this isn't a movie.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.120]   There's no bullet time.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.360]   Ooh boy.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.120]   This is some guy in the alley in the aisles
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.320]   is shooting this with his camera phone.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.320]   You could tell 'cause it's a vertical video.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.520]   Keanu is talking to the guy now.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.680]   - And he switched perspective completely with no problem?
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.320]   - I think he crossed the line.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.080]   Watch this, watch this, watch this.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.000]   Keanu is so good.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.080]   He's gonna give the man a dollar.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:56.480]   Well, that's a bunch of Franklin's.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.320]   Anyway, that's a deep fake, by the way.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.800]   And I think if you look at it,
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.200]   it's pretty obviously a deep fake.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.760]   Although I have to say,
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.160]   kudos to the people who crafted this video
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.920]   'cause it's pretty good.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.120]   It's pretty good, you know?
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.120]   But they just pace it.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.920]   - Somehow it's a two camera shoot.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.640]   - Yeah, somehow we got a two camera shoot.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.480]   I don't know.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.480]   You can't really cross the line with one camera,
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.320]   I don't think.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.400]   - And manage to edit it on the fly.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.360]   It's very impressive what these phones can do.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.800]   It must be a Samsung Note 10.
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.400]   - But honestly, if you showed this to a relative
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.520]   who's not wise in the ways of the world,
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.120]   do you think they would believe it?
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.440]   - No.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.440]   (laughing)
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.640]   - That's a little much.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.680]   - Okay, I guess.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.120]   - Yeah, you're right.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.920]   - So I don't think education's gonna,
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.920]   I think that's the point you were making, right, Stacey?
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.880]   Is that because?
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.920]   - Well, no, I just, I think that
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.200]   some people will become more sophisticated.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.120]   I was making two points.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.600]   One, we're already becoming more sophisticated.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.200]   It's spotting manipulation.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.520]   I think the youngs are better than the olds.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.280]   - At least they know it can be manipulated.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.120]   - Well, yeah.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.560]   And two, it's still going to have an effect
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.240]   because our brains aren't that smart.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.680]   We're gonna see something
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.080]   and it's gonna color our opinions,
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.320]   our reactions to things,
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.680]   even if we intellectually know they're not true.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.040]   So if I see, if someone made a deep fake of me
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.000]   kicking puppy dogs and I explained how that was not true,
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.080]   you're still gonna be like, when you see me,
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.880]   you're gonna, your brain's gonna call up me
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.240]   kicking a puppy dog and you're gonna be like,
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.200]   that person is not a good person.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.000]   Even though I am a very good person.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:27.840]   - Well.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.680]   - Here's the other piece.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.520]   Here's the other piece.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.880]   I wanna go to an experiment seriously about this.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.080]   So, so, the Kahneman also talks about
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:36.040]   how you can prime the brain, right?
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.400]   But if you see a bunch of happy things
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.000]   and then you see a news item,
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.120]   you're more likely to judge it positively
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.520]   than if you see gruesome things, right?
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.560]   And what does media do all the time?
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.840]   It shows you gruesome things.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.360]   I wanna do a little experiment,
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.600]   but however, what does the internet show you all the time?
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.040]   Kittens and puppies.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:56.880]   Why are we so angry?
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.600]   When we see kittens and puppies?
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.160]   I wonder.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.680]   I actually wanna do a simple little dumb experiment
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.680]   where you show one group, kittens and puppies,
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.360]   and then the same headlines that you show,
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.800]   somebody else gruesome and crap,
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.640]   and then you show them the same headlines.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.560]   What their reaction to those headlines is.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.160]   Ah.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.200]   - I avoid all gruesome crap on the internet.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.040]   I only look at, I only consume kittens.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.400]   - I increasingly, I bet you this is a nationwide phenomenon.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.720]   I'm watching the lot less news.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.160]   I'm just, I'm burying myself in,
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.480]   I don't think it's even escapism.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.320]   I just not focusing on that anymore.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.240]   - I also look, you got a brief shot of a puppy.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.360]   But then she moves on her puppy.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.200]   - Aww.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.560]   - Oh, she's stacy asleep.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.480]   - Yeah, she's stacy's--
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.320]   - Ready, here we go.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.600]   - Blood pressure is 100 points lower than ours.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.440]   - Aww.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.600]   - Just 'cause of that.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.440]   - Yay.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.280]   - That fuzzy brown thing.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.120]   - Up.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.360]   - On the ground there.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.760]   - And as you can see, I have not kicked her at all.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:01.360]   - Sometimes, she's over there in the corner scared of you,
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.880]   trying to be as far away from you as she can.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.960]   - Rubby the against the wall.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.560]   - Sometimes though. - Never.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.160]   - Sometimes though.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.360]   It's a good thing when somebody's angry.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.000]   I love Scott Galloway.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.120]   I don't know, how do you feel about Professor Galloway?
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.360]   'Cause he's kind of, I know him.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.400]   - I'm impressed, I've been at conference with him a lot.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:24.200]   I think this is, I think he's turned into pure showbiz.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.320]   I think this is awful.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.880]   - It is showbiz.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.120]   - Yeah, it's pure.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.840]   And he's, it's sorry, I'm gonna say it, gotta say it.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.840]   He is, he's going toward techno panic to try to sell books.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.600]   He's a nice guy, but I think he's gone over the edge
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.200]   where you compare that to a Stretatury's analysis,
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.160]   which is wise and mature and fact-filled.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.000]   - Aye, that's interesting.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.060]   - It's the same, by the way, the same bottom line result.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:54.800]   We're talking about, both we're talking about we work.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.800]   Scott calls it we, what, we WTF.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.360]   Both point out that there are some, they're doing an IPO.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:05.840]   Both point out there's some serious issues
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.400]   in the financials that anybody considering we work
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.440]   as an investment should consider.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.600]   Ben's more balanced 'cause he kind of gives the,
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.320]   we works point of view on this,
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.280]   but ultimately concludes the same thing,
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.000]   which is, he says Ben Thompson says,
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.920]   in short, there's a case that we work
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.000]   is both a symptom of software eating the world
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.800]   as well as an enabler and driver of the same,
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.360]   which would mean the company would still have access
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.480]   to the capital needs even in a recession.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.880]   See, this is the fear is that we work going
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.760]   into a recession has a mismatch of commitments.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:42.360]   It has long term, as long as 15 year leases,
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:46.960]   but if there's a recession, its income could change in a--
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.480]   - But as Ben also points out, in a recession
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.720]   is when companies will more want to save money
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.000]   on things like office space
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.240]   and they may end up getting more business as a result.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.440]   - The problem is you just don't point out how is it?
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.760]   - You don't, but it's an AWS model.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.920]   What he really points out is the real thing
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.880]   that's letting we work perhaps skate through this
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.640]   is they can just walk away from those leases
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.800]   and nobody's gonna do anything.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.000]   - Exactly.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.320]   Which of course-- - Of course,
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.880]   things that others complain about,
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.000]   like how the company's structured
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.240]   so you can't get to the leases is--
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.120]   - Yeah, there's an LLC for each one,
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.400]   a separate LLC for each one
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.560]   and they can't get to the big corporate.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.400]   Now that's not--
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.720]   - That is how we built big internet infrastructure
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.080]   back in the aughts.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.680]   I mean, bankruptcy helped lower the costs of things
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.400]   like Akamai for everyone.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.440]   So in some ways-- - In the end, Ben's--
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.680]   - Yeah. - Conclusion is,
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.920]   the real concerns about duration mismatch
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.720]   in a recession is a very good reason to stay away.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.880]   That and the sky-- - But that's like
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.800]   a last sentence-- - But he does go back
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.640]   through it. - And he does.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.640]   Meanwhile, Scott-- - He acknowledges
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:52.120]   the sense behind the model. - Yeah.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.120]   - And as opposed to others who just dismiss it
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.520]   and make fun of it,
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.560]   he delves in and understands it.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:02.520]   - Scott is very much the Jim Kramer now of this stuff.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.480]   - Oh, the clown costume on.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:09.480]   - Well, but it was a fun read. - He does brilliant presentations.
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.320]   - Yeah. - But it's all service.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.200]   He's gotten kind of over the edge.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.200]   - And I mean, there's some self-dealing
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.880]   in the we work, I mean-- - Oh, there's big self-dealing.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.160]   - I'm like, "Good Lord, this thing nasty and nasty."
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.160]   - Sold the we trade mark to we work for $5.9 million.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:35.160]   He also took $700 million in stock off the table
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:40.160]   before the IPO, which as Scott says,
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.840]   "Is 700 million red flags a spell?
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:46.360]   Words on the football field at halftime saying,
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.600]   'Get me the hell out of this stock, but you should buy some.'"
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.920]   (laughing)
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.680]   I don't know, I enjoyed it, it's funny.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.280]   - It's funny, but is it not wrong?
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.840]   - It's not wrong either.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.760]   - Oh, yeah, no, because it is--
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.520]   - You enjoyed reading Ben Thompson's three times longer
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.560]   because of the exact piece-- - Sought piece.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.320]   - Okay. - He just dismiss,
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.520]   there's something to understand here.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.280]   And Ben realizes that-- - Yes.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.600]   - And explains it and does journalism.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.560]   Scott just makes fun of him. - No, Scott's not doing journalism.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.280]   - Which is, Scott's doing plenty of-- - Scott's doing plenty of tree.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:21.560]   - Well, yeah, but that should include some facts
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.520]   and some sense to it.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.600]   He's just exploiting it for the yachts.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.680]   If we're pure comedy, but that's not what he does,
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.600]   that's not what he sells himself.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.880]   He sells himself as a business analyst.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.960]   - I think it's a matter, honestly, of just taste.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:36.160]   Like some people prefer one, some people prefer the other.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.760]   - I think it's a matter of substance and Scott's laxant.
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.800]   - Yeah, I'm with Jeff on this.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.400]   - There's some substance in here.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:43.240]   - Not very much.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.320]   And what it is-- - There's also cartoons,
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.240]   which I like.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.760]   (laughing)
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.640]   - So I have a very serious, very, very,
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.360]   I have a very serious question.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.440]   No, I do have a, I don't know if it's a policy question,
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.080]   but this model, the AWS,
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:05.080]   the, someone sent me the server for certification of everything.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.000]   - Servification, I like that word.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.880]   - Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.600]   But this idea that we're turning our capital,
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.320]   basically all of our capital as a business,
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:20.080]   even as like an individual, into an operational expense.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.640]   So we're renting everything.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.440]   Because in our country, historically,
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.440]   wealth generation has accrued to people
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:32.600]   who have capital investments, like a home or less so a car,
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.600]   but you can buy a car and make money off of it,
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.440]   for example, if you want.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:41.840]   It feels like a huge societal shift that we're undergoing.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.760]   And I really wish we had more,
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.960]   I wanna read more books, I wanna understand
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.440]   where economists think how that's gonna affect
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:52.040]   our wide and gap in wealth,
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.080]   how it's gonna affect assets over time.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.320]   And I feel like nobody's really talking very smartly about this.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.680]   So I throw this out there,
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.240]   I would love to learn more about this.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.680]   I wanna know who's thinking about this, send me,
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:05.840]   'cause I'm thinking about it.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.400]   And I'm not smart enough to know what it's gonna mean.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.520]   - So I just realized, what's really going on in this show
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:17.520]   is the tension between my Scott Galloway-esque antics
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.080]   and you two's thoughtful measures.
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.920]   - It works better Leo when you have people here.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.280]   - Fact-based.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.320]   - Journalist.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.840]   - Well-animated eyebrows.
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:31.680]   - Yeah.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.520]   - I kinda like that.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.160]   - There was, I was like,
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.560]   - I would juggle during this show if I could.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.400]   - Oh, you guys sitting in front of a giant Mylar 3,
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:40.920]   I mean come on. - You've got
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:42.200]   the voicemakers right in front of you,
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.160]   you go ahead, do it.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.280]   Where's the noise, no, in front of you,
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.320]   there's the noise makers, do it.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.480]   - Oh, this is the show all about Google.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.800]   You know what, the problem with modern noise makers?
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.280]   (laughing)
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.480]   They make no noise.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.360]   - That was really sad, you're right.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.480]   (laughing)
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.280]   - Stacey, since you're being serious,
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.240]   I'll be serious, we'll ignore the clown.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.500]   (laughing)
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:13.920]   - So Stacey.
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.180]   (laughing)
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:18.340]   - Go ahead.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.460]   - I dare you.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:21.660]   - Try to make an important point, just try.
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:22.980]   I dare you.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.340]   - I got confused.
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:25.900]   And I'm not afraid to use him.
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:28.740]   (laughing)
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:30.100]   - So, okay.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.860]   - Guys, I'm gonna take a nap.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:32.860]   - Go ahead, it's all yours.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.580]   - So somebody tweeted, I can't remember who.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:39.980]   The CEOs who all got together last week and said supposedly,
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:41.380]   and we will take this with a grain of salt
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:45.460]   the size of Utah, that the shareholders are an older,
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:48.180]   the shareholder return is no longer their primary value.
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.100]   They deal with all these constituencies
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.100]   of which shareholders are one.
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:53.980]   And we can read that as the (beep)
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:56.620]   BS, sorry, 'cause whoever has to cut that out,
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.380]   that probably is.
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.540]   But, somebody pointed out that there's,
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.820]   to your point, Stacey, there's a big transition going on now.
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.100]   And you go from the industrial,
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.820]   from the time of guilds to corporations,
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:11.460]   whoever it was said, now we're in the age of networks,
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.300]   and you have to operate differently
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.580]   with all these constituencies.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.180]   I think that might be stretching it.
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:19.300]   But your spidey sense here, I think is quite right.
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:21.700]   We're in a fundamental economic shift
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:24.180]   in a structural shift in how things are done.
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.340]   And we don't really understand it at all yet.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.820]   I agree.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.580]   Now you can get the moisture.
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.860]   - We can call it (beep)
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:33.820]   paradigm shift.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:35.660]   - Oh, don't, if you use that as a word,
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.380]   I'm gonna write it.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.020]   - Five dollars in the jar.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:42.460]   - I'm like, well, how many for moral panic
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.660]   did you have to shake?
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:44.500]   - Wait a minute.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.340]   What's going on here?
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.060]   - That's important to the world.
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:48.900]   They're stealing the cupcakes.
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:49.740]   (laughing)
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:50.580]   - Oh.
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.300]   - The four staff.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.140]   - The forever.
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:55.180]   - The four staff has been sitting here,
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:56.860]   staring at all the sweets
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.660]   arrayed in front of me,
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.180]   and they can't touch them.
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.020]   I was trying to feed you, I think.
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:01.940]   - What about a show guest?
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:02.900]   Are they getting any?
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:05.700]   - Would you guys like cupcakes or macarons or cookies?
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:06.540]   - Oh, cool.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.380]   - Please, no, no, come on.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.220]   - Dana's gonna do it.
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:10.980]   I know she's been sitting through this.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:11.900]   She's no, she's.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:13.060]   - All right, there we go.
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:13.900]   - There you go.
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:14.740]   Come on.
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.580]   - No, you don't have to use the hand.
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:17.580]   (laughing)
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.020]   No, Jie, come on.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:19.860]   Come on.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.460]   - You're already on camera.
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:22.820]   Ramon have some.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:24.940]   Ramon's taking pictures, of course.
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.540]   Gotta get that on your Instagram.
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.300]   Are you an influencer?
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.180]   No, okay.
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:30.020]   Oh, he's gonna take the--
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:32.260]   - I like how they're still hesitant as they walk up.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:34.100]   They're like reaping up.
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.580]   - I know, we can see you.
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:37.580]   - You're on camera.
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:38.420]   - You're on camera.
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:40.980]   - We see everything.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:41.820]   Everything.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.860]   - Now, I want my cupcake.
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.020]   Are you gonna send it in the mail?
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:46.860]   Like you did the rookies.
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.700]   - Yeah, give me an envelope.
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:48.700]   I'll FedEx it to you.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:52.020]   So I asked where did the Rode maker go?
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:53.340]   'Cause it's not in the kitchen anymore.
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:54.340]   Oh yeah.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:55.620]   We're supervising producer.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.220]   Took it home.
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.460]   - Oh, but did you buy it?
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:13:59.900]   - It's in her kitchen.
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:00.740]   - I don't know.
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.580]   I don't think so.
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.100]   - You can't eat Rode.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.500]   - No, but I think it should be returned to Rodematic
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.380]   if we're not gonna use it.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.220]   - All right, I'm--
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.100]   - We sent us a lunch today.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:12.300]   What was for lunch on lunch Wednesday?
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.060]   - We had Lily Kai Chinese.
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:14.900]   It was very good.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:16.820]   It's lunch Wednesday.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:17.660]   - You know that's--
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:18.820]   - You see, Jeff now knows he was here.
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:19.660]   - Lunch.
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:20.500]   - Yeah.
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.940]   - Oh speaking of lunch,
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:25.580]   I just had the Chipotle queso recently thinking
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:26.420]   that they had changed it,
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:29.020]   but they didn't, so everybody do not be fooled.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:29.860]   It's still bad.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:30.700]   Okay.
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:31.700]   - Is there any other source of queso
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.540]   in the Great Pacific Northwest?
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.260]   - Yeah, I can make it myself.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:36.860]   - Trader Joe's has decent queso.
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:38.420]   - In a jar.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:39.700]   - For jar queso, it's okay.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.700]   - Oh no, that is no.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.180]   - Oh, I've got another one for you.
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:48.140]   - Have you had the Burger King Impossible Whopper?
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:48.980]   - I have.
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.700]   - I have actually, I had it in an airport.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:51.700]   - A review please.
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:52.700]   - What did you think?
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:55.740]   - I mean, I thought it was good.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:58.820]   - So this is the new pseudo meat
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:01.820]   that ironically for me,
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:03.980]   because I'm on a ketogenic diet,
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:06.820]   I can't eat, I can eat meat meat,
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.380]   but I can't eat pseudo meat,
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.500]   'cause it's got a lot of carbs in it.
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.340]   - Yeah.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:13.700]   - Yeah, Andrew can't eat it either.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:17.180]   - Does it taste like a hamburger?
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.460]   - It has the texture of a hamburger.
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:22.180]   It does not taste like a hamburger.
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.840]   - Well, here's, I had my first possible
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.180]   at, was it called, umani?
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.020]   - Umami burger.
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.180]   - Umami, yeah.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:30.340]   - It was very good.
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.180]   - Yeah.
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.100]   - It was very good.
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:34.220]   And then I went, then two days later,
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.060]   I was at the, um--
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:37.660]   - You wouldn't expect burger king to make it
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.060]   as well as umami burger.
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.260]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:41.100]   No, it is not.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.140]   It has a slight weird taste of burger king,
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.900]   and umami was not, it was burger.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:45.900]   It was very good.
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:50.260]   - I honestly, as somebody, 'cause I'm on keto,
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.060]   I eat a lot of meat because I can't eat any carbs,
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:52.980]   zero carbs.
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:56.300]   But I don't wanna be a meat eater,
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.460]   I'd rather be a vegetarian,
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.660]   and when they can come up with that raised muscle matter,
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.100]   or whatever it's gonna be,
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:02.940]   but that's not what this is.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:03.980]   - Chicken nubs.
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:04.940]   - Yeah.
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:05.940]   That's not what this is.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:06.780]   - It's chicken nubs.
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:07.940]   - This is not actual meat.
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:10.180]   Chicken nubs, are they meat?
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.820]   - Chicken nubs are,
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:13.860]   Margaret Atwood wrote about them in Perks and Cranks.
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:14.860]   - Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:15.700]   It's not real.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:16.540]   - It was a back grown chicken.
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:17.380]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.060]   - Back grown chicken.
[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:21.140]   That's what I'm ready for anytime.
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:21.980]   Because I will--
[01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:22.820]   - We had guests.
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:23.900]   - The nutritional value of meat
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:27.500]   without the sad fact that you have to kill an animal
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.620]   to get it.
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:30.740]   - We had guests the other day who were,
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.660]   we had to go meet 'em in the city of a restaurant,
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:34.780]   we had to find a restaurant where they're on keto
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:36.420]   and they're vegetarian.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:37.620]   - That's hard.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.900]   - That's really-- - That's really awesome.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:40.740]   - That's really-- - But not.
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:42.740]   - You cannot impossible, but very difficult.
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:45.900]   - We found a place that had pizza made with cauliflower.
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.780]   - Bingo.
[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:49.420]   - No, there you go.
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:50.260]   That worked.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.780]   - Yeah, my husband's on a weird diet,
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:54.580]   Anna was a vegetarian, and I just,
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:55.780]   I literally gave up.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:57.940]   We started eating bowls every night,
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:59.260]   which was basically-- - Yeah, you get a bowl
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:00.660]   and you get a bowl and you get a bowl.
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:02.380]   There are three different bowls.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:03.460]   (laughs)
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:07.260]   - You basically do a base layer and then pour whatever you want.
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:08.980]   - Customize, yeah.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:14.860]   The Stadia Founders Edition is sold out.
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:19.060]   I don't like those stories 'cause we don't know
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.580]   how many they had.
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:21.420]   - Yeah.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:22.260]   - Almost sold out.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:25.780]   In some countries, they could have sold five of 'em.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:26.620]   We don't know.
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:30.340]   November is when Google's streaming gaming service
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:32.660]   comes and video's been making a lot of noise saying,
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:34.700]   you know, we've had GeForce now for years.
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.900]   We've been doing this for years.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.380]   Really, this is not new.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:40.460]   We're doing it too.
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:44.580]   Let me do, let's see.
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.620]   Oh, I'm sad.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:47.460]   I'm sad.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:51.700]   This San Francisco webcam has been up and running
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:55.340]   since before just-- - Oh, yeah, this is sad.
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:57.380]   - The San Francisco fog cam,
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.100]   it's the world's oldest public webcam
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:01.420]   and went up in 1995.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.420]   They were inspired by a webcam.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:07.300]   You and I remember, which wasn't a streaming camera.
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:08.380]   It wasn't public.
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:11.420]   The Cambridge Coffee Cam.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.260]   - Right.
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:15.620]   - The Cambridge Trojan Room Coffee Cam.
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:19.180]   I wonder if it's, I see a link, is it still there now?
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:21.820]   It was, it would upload an image of a coffee pot
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:23.100]   three times a minute.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:29.140]   This was one of the, this was the very first cam.
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:32.740]   The fog cam was on the roof at San Francisco State University
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:36.460]   for many, many years,
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:39.460]   but they're taking it down.
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:41.980]   It's time to say goodbye.
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.540]   I think these are ads.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:44.620]   I'm sorry.
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.700]   - I don't know what this slideshow has to do with anything.
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.460]   It's just random.
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:52.620]   It's the most random slideshow I've ever seen.
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:55.380]   This is just, this is just--
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:57.300]   - It's the perfect slideshow for twins.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:02.300]   - It's like a r- a r- a- a r- a- a r- a- a- a r- a- a- a- a- a.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:03.140]   - What is going on?
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:08.140]   - I don't know what's going on.
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:12.700]   - Yeah, can you, can you say the name of each thing
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.060]   as it goes by?
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:15.060]   - Please.
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:17.460]   - No, that's a Ramos Fizz, the San Francisco drink
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:18.300]   invented.
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.140]   - No, no, no, no, no, that's, that's the Irish coffee down.
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:22.300]   What's the Irish coffee for the Buena Vista?
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:23.140]   Okay, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:23.980]   - Buena Vista, yeah.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:24.820]   - Tourist trap.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:25.940]   - Yeah.
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:28.300]   - Here's a guy named Maurice Campbell,
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:32.260]   a San Francisco guy who invented so-called Swedish Sky vodka.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:36.660]   Tofu was not discovered in the Bay Area, but it was--
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:37.740]   - I just well have been.
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:41.980]   - It was the antioxidant properties we discovered
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.100]   by a Berkeley scientist.
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.940]   I guess this is a San Francisco slideshow.
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:48.740]   Vitamin K discovered in basil,
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:52.940]   the element C Borgium was discovered.
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:54.420]   What is this slideshow?
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:55.260]   - What is this?
[01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:56.300]   - Oh, I think the San Francisco--
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.140]   - But cranes these things.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:57.980]   - But cranes these things together.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:02.980]   - It's all birdies. - I think it's educational.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:05.580]   - Yeah.
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.980]   - So I'm back to the fog game.
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:08.540]   - It started with fog cam.
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:12.260]   - That's the fog cam, which is the name of the story.
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:14.940]   But the slideshow has nothing to do with it.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.860]   - Maybe, well, here.
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:17.260]   - Not sure if look.
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:19.100]   - It got me to click, no kidding.
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:21.700]   Here's a Rube Goldmerg machine.
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:24.700]   Here's some, a woman staring at some computer screens.
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.420]   A lot of computer screens.
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:30.500]   - Oh, it tells you what it's doing.
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.340]   - Yeah, but why?
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:33.060]   - It's the 911 center. - Why?
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.620]   - Yeah, and there's a deep sea diving--
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:35.620]   - What are these three things?
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.140]   - One thing to do another.
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.980]   - Here's a guy watching off his suit.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:41.340]   - Is that how you--
[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:42.780]   - That's Dev Nell's wetsuit.
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:43.620]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:44.580]   We finally got it.
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:46.260]   - Got the hose in it.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:48.220]   - Yeah, I never had a hose in mind.
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:49.980]   Here's a cable modem.
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:54.140]   Here is a synthesis.
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.340]   Oh, this is the OP1.
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:56.180]   - That's the OP1.
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:59.300]   - That's the OP1 synthesizer by Teenage Engineering
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:00.140]   of Sweden.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:02.500]   I know, I do too there.
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.740]   It's sort of, they're sold out.
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.420]   Here's the guy who invented the floppy disk,
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:06.420]   Alan Schugart.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:08.220]   - Aw.
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:09.060]   - Here's the--
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:09.900]   - Finally!
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:10.740]   - The fog cam.
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:11.580]   - The fog cam.
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:12.740]   - Got all the way around.
[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:13.860]   - Thank God, we're free.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.620]   - So you know, after fog cam, you know what I created?
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:17.700]   - What?
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.700]   - Berbo cam.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.940]   - Oh. - In Berbo and Street,
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.300]   in New Orleans.
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:25.460]   - You did the first Bourbon Street webcam?
[01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:30.460]   - The cam, we did that and were you at the Good Nola Observer?
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:32.820]   - I could get back and lose people's jobs.
[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:33.660]   - Yeah.
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.500]   - Yeah.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.340]   - We know what happens.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:37.020]   - No, yeah, there was a lot of that.
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.100]   - On Bourbon Street.
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.820]   So you weren't above pandering is what you say.
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:43.740]   - Oh no, oh no.
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:44.740]   Click for clicks.
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:45.780]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:49.220]   - That's like the pre-Mugshot,
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:51.420]   you know, the Mugshot websites.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:53.140]   This is like before the Mugshots.
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:54.820]   - The Bourbon Street. - You're there.
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.060]   - And with facial recognition,
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:58.220]   you can actually create a timeline for people
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:21:59.060]   to do that. - Would you create that
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:21:59.900]   for the Nola Observer?
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:01.820]   - Or for advance, which owned at the time,
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:02.900]   the Times Picky Eon.
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:03.740]   - Oh, the time.
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:06.460]   - Or Nola.com, which is since Times Picky Eon.
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:07.900]   - This is actually a timely story.
[01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:09.980]   The Times Picky Eon is gone.
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:11.540]   - Yep, yep.
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.980]   - One of the great local papers in New Orleans papers.
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:19.660]   And by the way, they had a really credible digital strategy
[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:20.900]   with Nola.com.
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:23.500]   - Mm-hmm. - What happened?
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.020]   - They got caught.
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.420]   - When they reduced frequency of delivery,
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:32.220]   the Baton Rouge paper took advantage
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:36.180]   of New Orleans anger at this
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:39.340]   and came in and competed with them uneconomically.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.500]   But it finally became uneconomical
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:42.340]   for the Times Picky Eon.
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:43.780]   They keep going, they sold the paper
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:46.060]   and the advocate laid off the entire newsroom.
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.260]   - They sold the paper to one of those free weekly papers.
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.620]   - Oh no, they're advocate.
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.980]   - No, no, they're advocate was a real paper
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:53.940]   from the Baton Rouge.
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:55.220]   - Oh, okay, oh, okay.
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.420]   I thought it was one of the weeklies that bought them.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.940]   - No, it wasn't like the examiner in San Francisco.
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.660]   - That did happen in San Francisco, yeah.
[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:02.500]   - No, I saw it.
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.140]   - I would tell people, I used to work on the examiner
[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:05.300]   when it was a real paper.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:08.860]   - It was absorbed by the advocate.
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:09.700]   Isn't that sad?
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.380]   That happened in July.
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.740]   Yet another daily gone.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:16.060]   - Yep.
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.700]   - And the whole staff is, no,
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:20.060]   only a third of the staff is left.
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:21.820]   Two thirds of the staff were gone.
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:26.260]   - Should we do a change this?
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:29.540]   - Let's play the, pay the timponies here.
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:31.540]   - All right, I wanted to talk.
[01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:32.420]   - I wanted to talk, I actually,
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:34.100]   - No, okay, before that.
[01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:35.580]   - Before that, I wanted to talk.
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:36.740]   - Produce, Carsten.
[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:39.580]   - One story that's actually related
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:42.660]   to what we were just talking about.
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:44.140]   - Yes.
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:49.140]   - The fact that we just hit the era of,
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:53.780]   Google searches that result in no clicks.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.660]   - Google, another paradise.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:59.300]   - Another sense traffic to anyone.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.140]   - What?
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.220]   - Yeah, over 50% of Google searches
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:05.340]   don't result in clicks to search results.
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:06.460]   - Oh, people do this search
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:08.500]   and then go get a hot dog.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:10.700]   - No, they do this search and they get the,
[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:12.100]   - I need the blurb.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.220]   - Oh. - And say.
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.860]   - This is not good, this is living,
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:17.420]   this is evidence of the snippet war.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:18.820]   - This is the snippet war.
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.620]   - This has been one.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:21.460]   - Why?
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.540]   - Yeah, and this is actually good because this,
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:25.140]   well, as long as we can figure out,
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:27.580]   or Google can figure out how to monetize this,
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:31.060]   it's okay because they needed a strategy
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:33.420]   for dealing with things like voice
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:37.100]   and a world where screens are smaller or non-existent.
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.900]   And they're still serving their audience.
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:43.020]   The question is, how does that affect their revenue?
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:43.860]   Actually, the question is,
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.020]   how does it affect their profits?
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.580]   - So this is, - Again, publishers are gonna
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:49.460]   play that affects their profits.
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:50.300]   - This came up. - Oh yeah,
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.540]   publishers always complain.
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:53.820]   - Exactly. - With Google's announcements
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:58.780]   about Project Owl or no, this is something new.
[01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:01.380]   So they had announced this before,
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:04.820]   it's only, by the way, I miss heard you say 50,
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.780]   it's 15, one five.
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:12.940]   - Less than half of Google searches now result in a click.
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:14.020]   So it is 50.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:15.980]   - 50. - If you click five zero.
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:18.180]   - This is not a Google of--
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.180]   - Yeah, this isn't a Google number, this is a--
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:22.140]   - A study from-- - Random software company
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:24.820]   SparkToro. - Oh, come on.
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:26.300]   - SparkToro. - SparkToro.
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:29.300]   - A majority of all browser-based Google searches
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:32.740]   resulted in zero, kind of SparkToro now.
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:36.700]   - I'm calling the authorities.
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:41.900]   - SparkToro, that sounds made up.
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:45.960]   - Speaking of-- - All companies sound
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.100]   made up. - Yeah, that's true.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.620]   All the good names are taken.
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:53.580]   Speaking of made up stories, apparently,
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:58.140]   did you hear Google manipulated millions of votes
[01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:00.980]   and swayed the election?
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:02.060]   Did you hear that?
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:03.460]   - All their fault. - Yeah, yeah,
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:05.180]   they're just, they just have it out for conservatives.
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:06.500]   That's what they do all the time, right?
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.620]   - Millions of votes. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:10.280]   - Oh yeah. - This, just we should
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.980]   debunk it actually, I have to say.
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:13.580]   - But the irony label around those people.
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:17.200]   - Yeah, Devin Coldway at TechCrunch did a really,
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:21.160]   I thought, very quality job of debunking it.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.160]   He starts with the president's tweet,
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.880]   coincidentally, Fox News had just mentioned that
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.560]   about five minutes earlier.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:33.000]   The report that Fox was talking about came out in 2017.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.080]   It was a study of 95 people,
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.680]   95 people over the 25 days preceding the election.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:46.680]   And even if, even the results from the 95 people
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.420]   didn't prove or demonstrate anything like the report,
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:54.260]   there's no abstract, no introduction,
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:57.060]   no methods section to show the statistics work
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:59.540]   and definition of terms, no discussion, no references.
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:02.300]   It was not reviewed by any peers.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:07.340]   In fact, it was the creation of a guy
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:10.320]   who was written apparently many, many opinion pieces.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:14.760]   Against Google on outlets like the Epic Times,
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:19.760]   which is of course Falun Gong's bizarre news source
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.320]   and the Daily Caller, as well as USA Today
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.480]   in Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:27.360]   Siting math, he does not describe,
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.440]   he declared there was a pro-Clinton bias
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:30.440]   in Google search results.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:33.000]   No, he said it would over time,
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.240]   shift at least 2.6 million votes to Clinton.
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.480]   We don't know how much time or how.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.880]   So it was bogus.
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:42.960]   And I don't even know why I'm spending any energy on this.
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:43.800]   Another tweet.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.760]   - When you debunk things, you end up spreading message.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.600]   - Yeah, right.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.440]   - Trapped.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.400]   - Trapped, you can't win.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.240]   - Trapped.
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.160]   Trapped.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.040]   That's why I don't watch the news anymore.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.920]   I'm just trapped.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.200]   - Here, quick.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.760]   - Trapped, have a cookie.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.600]   - Puppy cam.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.440]   - Oh, puppy cam.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.920]   - Oh, puppy, yo, puppy wakes up.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:03.760]   You call?
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.480]   - She knows she knows she knows she knows she knows she knows.
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.560]   - What is she, a quirky?
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.920]   - No, she is a mutt.
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.520]   A mutt, quirky.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.920]   - There's a quirky in there somewhere.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.080]   - That's what I tell my daughter,
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.280]   but she doesn't believe me.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.120]   - Oh, man.
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.720]   - Did you see in the midst of the whole Portland
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:22.040]   and Tifa is gonna go against the Proud Boys, blah, blah, blah?
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.480]   There was a parade of corkeys.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.360]   - Again, solution to everything is a parade of corkeys.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.640]   - Corkeys are the solution to everything indeed.
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.400]   - Now, I got a quick question for you, Stacey.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.320]   - Before, before, real quick.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.560]   IKEA says they're gonna go heavy into IOT.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.000]   - Oh, yeah, your standards.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   - Let us talk about this, yes.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.520]   Is that a standards hell or does,
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.920]   if you're a fifth party like that,
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.080]   how do you get it and make everybody happy?
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.640]   - So IKEA has been doing this for a while,
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:53.920]   and what they've done is created a separate business unit.
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:56.240]   This isn't that weird because what I learned,
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.320]   what I visited IKEA a couple of years ago
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.960]   is everything's a separate business unit in IKEA.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.960]   So that's one.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.840]   - I also learned that Swedish meatballs
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.360]   and Lingonberry Jam are an amazing combination.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.240]   - So, in the contrary to what you'd think,
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.240]   are you kidding me? - They are.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.600]   - Because they have-- - Meatballs are really good.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.160]   - They are really good.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.200]   - Like the corporate IKEA meatballs
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.280]   are way better than the store IKEA meatballs.
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.640]   - Oh, you had the corporate IKEA meatballs.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:21.320]   - Yes, I went because they promised me moose meatballs,
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:24.800]   but apparently it was not hunting season,
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.080]   so they did not have moose in the cafeteria.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.080]   This was their excuse.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.720]   - Probably why they were so good.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:33.120]   - But still, delicious meatballs.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.480]   The point here is,
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.920]   (laughing)
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.080]   not meatballs.
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.760]   - They were making-- - For instance,
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:40.960]   they were making coffee tables
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.000]   with built-in wireless Qi charging.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.120]   They've done it for a couple of years,
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:44.960]   they've been doing that.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.960]   I think that's really cool.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.680]   I wish I could get it from restoration hardware,
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:50.000]   though not IKEA.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.240]   (laughing)
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.840]   - Oh, you're so not really that fancy.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.560]   - I don't wanna put, I have had flat paper.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.640]   - No, it's room and board.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.040]   It's nicer than restoration.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.560]   - I don't like putting it all together.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:02.360]   - I used to, I used to, when we got married,
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.880]   the first IKEA was in Philadelphia.
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.320]   We drove by little Honda down.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.240]   We furnished almost our entire house.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:08.320]   - Cheap, yeah.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.320]   - Out of, out of, out of--
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.400]   - Oh, I've done that.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.760]   - Great dining room, son.
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.320]   - I thought this was so amazing.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:18.280]   I said, we've gotta go to where this happens.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:21.280]   And we went on vacation to Sweden because of IKEA.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.120]   - Wow.
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:22.960]   - Wow.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:23.800]   - That's nutty.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:25.400]   - No, but I think IKEA has done a lot
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.920]   for the reputation of the Swedes.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.120]   I set a place that has,
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.120]   it has a special box of dishes
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:34.160]   for 20 year old single people in an apartment.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.080]   I, that's like socialism and dishes.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.040]   I love that.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:37.880]   - Yeah.
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:38.720]   - So we went.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.040]   - Okay, so on the smart home front,
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.960]   with the creation of this business seems like,
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.240]   let's get it happen.
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.440]   Since you asked, I will try to answer.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.400]   They work, IKEA has created, they've done two things.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:51.160]   One, they're very focused on creating products
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:55.400]   that make sense for people, like mainstream consumers.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.320]   So they do things that are a little different.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.960]   So like they're Chod Few Light bulbs,
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.240]   those will work with their hub
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:04.600]   in their own wireless protocols, right?
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.080]   So you have to have that.
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.680]   - Oh, it doesn't support a standard.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.480]   - Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:11.320]   - I'm holding.
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:16.320]   - They do support Google Assistant, Amazon, Echo
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.640]   and for some products, Apple's HomeKit.
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.800]   So what they're doing is they're creating
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:26.440]   what they feel is an optimal solution for everybody.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:29.920]   But if you're really fancy and you wanna work outside the box,
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.240]   they're creating links to do so.
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:36.160]   So that is the strategy.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:39.160]   - It's not a completely terrible idea.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.800]   - It's not, I like the Chod Free bulbs.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:45.800]   They're actually, once everything got working like it should,
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.680]   they were actually really good.
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:52.360]   They're friendly in the sense that you don't have to have
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:54.440]   an echo, you don't have to know you're doing a smart home,
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:55.840]   you can just screw these bulbs in,
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:58.600]   plug this device in and boom, you have smart lights.
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.600]   There's a lot of value in that.
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:05.520]   And they're relatively inexpensive
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:09.200]   and they're doing products that people want
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.120]   and they have a sustainability angle associated with them too.
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:12.960]   - What's that?
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:16.120]   - So they don't create a connected product
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:19.880]   if it doesn't have a shelf life of a certain number of years.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:22.520]   So they're not gonna do some stupid one-off product.
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.280]   - How about the security angle?
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:28.120]   - How about the security angle?
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.200]   - They've done the pen testing.
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.120]   They're not, I mean, nothing's ever happened.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:32.960]   - Are they over the year,
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:34.040]   are theyatable and all of that?
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.200]   - Oh yeah, they totally are, yes.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:40.360]   To be fair, IKEA does have a hub, you guys.
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.200]   It has the Chod Free hub.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.600]   So you have this tiny little hub.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.080]   - Oh, it's a little hub.
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:46.440]   It's never gonna sell in America
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:49.440]   if they don't come up with names that don't sound like you're--
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:50.360]   - Puteur.
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.200]   - Hocking a loo.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:52.040]   - Chod Free.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:54.160]   I did a whole episode, I've done two episodes actually
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:56.360]   with a guy who's heading this group up.
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.320]   And in one of them, he's trying to teach me
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:00.120]   how to say Chod Free properly.
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:02.320]   - Well, you do apparently.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:04.040]   - Sometimes, Chod Free.
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:05.160]   - Chod Free.
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.000]   - The only guy I learned was your scooby,
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.960]   your har and omelette.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.880]   - I would like an omelette.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.840]   - Well, I actually don't like them, but I learned that.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.720]   - Hey, the best thing about Sweden is Fika.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.760]   That's what I have, oh, oh, ready you guys?
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.800]   We're gonna go full circle, watch it, watch it.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:22.200]   - Uh oh, yeah.
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.880]   - Is the three o'clock cake break.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.880]   - Oh, look at that.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.880]   - I'm being done, this is a tiny cake.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.360]   - Oh, look at that.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.440]   - I am going to make that the title of this show,
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.200]   the three o'clock cake break.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.040]   - Cake break.
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:35.320]   (laughing)
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.160]   - Now.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.000]   - Make it easy, I wanted that.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:37.840]   - Now we can do something.
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:41.680]   - Can we please the Google change log?
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:44.200]   (dramatic music)
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.280]   - There's nothing.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:46.640]   - Nothing.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.480]   Nothing.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:50.720]   Nothing in the Google change log.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:54.200]   - Well, I managed to update my Android auto.
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:55.400]   I didn't know that I could.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.720]   - You could force it to settings.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.320]   - Thanks to Life Hacker, we now know you can force it.
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:01.120]   - Well, it's very easy, it's actually,
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.000]   they want you to, it just says, "Try it."
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:03.840]   - Oh.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.840]   - And it's good, the only complaint I have,
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.120]   because now when you have your audio up,
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.720]   it gives you the directions at the bottom.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.040]   It keeps that on the screen.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:11.880]   - Nice.
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:13.440]   - Which is very nice, you can go to more applications,
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.760]   more easily, which is very nice.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.040]   The UI is pretty good,
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.120]   the one complaint remains, Google, are you listening?
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:20.960]   - Yeah.
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:24.160]   - In ways, you cannot get,
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.240]   any of the UI sucks,
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:27.520]   you can't tell if a button is hot or not to push it,
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.560]   'cause the colors aren't different enough,
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:31.680]   and it's really stupid UI design, that's one.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.320]   Be more irritating, I can't get text
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.280]   turned by turn directions in ways.
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:39.960]   - Oh.
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.280]   - I don't know if that's because they think,
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.600]   you shouldn't be reading now,
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.880]   but I don't know where I'm going next.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:45.720]   - Yeah.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:46.560]   - I like to get that.
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.400]   - It's a good difference.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:48.240]   - In text, I do like that.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.080]   - I like that.
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:49.920]   - Yeah.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:53.040]   - I can't get that, but you got the pop-up that said,
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:53.880]   would you like to try it?
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:55.680]   And you said yes, if you don't get that.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:57.640]   - No, I want to leave Life Hacker.
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:00.120]   - Yeah, Life Hacker says, "Go into the settings,"
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.040]   and there should be now a setting that says,
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.360]   "Try the new Android Auto."
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.200]   Here, show my screen.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.040]   - First thing.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.520]   - Show my screen cards, there you go.
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.520]   - Yes.
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:11.040]   - There, try the new Android Auto.
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.240]   So if you switch that on,
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:13.640]   then you'll get the little pop-up,
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:14.560]   and you'll be able to try it.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.320]   Do you like the dark mode?
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:18.160]   - No.
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.000]   - Okay.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:19.840]   - I don't.
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:20.680]   - Just checking.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:25.440]   - Scares me.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.200]   - It's so dark.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.040]   Too dark.
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:29.720]   - Wow.
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.680]   - Google is killing YouTube messages.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.300]   I didn't even know YouTube had messages.
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:36.840]   It's a hidden messaging client,
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.160]   it's built into the tube.
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.160]   - It's one of Google's seven messaging clients.
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:43.640]   - That if you're counting,
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.880]   it's going away after September 18th, 2019,
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:48.160]   and then there were six.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.520]   - It hardly knew you.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.360]   - And then there were six.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.480]   - Wait, when is Hangout's gonna be fully deprecated?
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.320]   What's happening there?
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:54.480]   - Please, say that out loud.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:56.040]   - Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:56.880]   It's okay.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.840]   It's not going away, at least,
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.040]   at least for Google, for G Suite people,
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:04.600]   at least until next summer.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.120]   - Well, I'm a five person,
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:07.400]   and I also have it.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:10.680]   But the problem is like the new Samsung phones,
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:12.600]   I can't choose it as a default messaging app.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.440]   I have to use either Android messages
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:16.740]   or Samsung messages.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:19.480]   But I don't want to,
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:21.360]   but if somebody sends a message to my phone
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.600]   by that phone's number,
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.640]   it'll go in there and I won't see it.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.120]   But if they send it to my Google voice number,
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.520]   which is the number I give everybody,
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.320]   it will still go in Hangouts.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:32.160]   So that's, I just use Hangouts,
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.800]   'cause I'll see it if they use my proper Google voice number.
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.640]   - But Hangouts' video phone calls still continues,
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:40.960]   right, I don't care about that so much.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.160]   There's plenty of video.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:46.240]   I care about the fact that I wanna be able to see messages
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.560]   on Android iOS and the desktop.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.280]   And right now, the desktop solution
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.600]   is not great for Android messages.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.880]   There is no Mac solution as far as I know.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.840]   So I just, I want them to keep Hangouts
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.160]   or something like it.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.000]   Hangouts is not-- - Hangouts is not--
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000]   - It's just-- - If you don't,
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.840]   if I tell Google, no, I understand,
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.520]   it's not an SMS messaging app.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.920]   It's like, what's app?
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.840]   It's a messaging app.
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:14.920]   Just keep that around.
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:18.040]   I'll be happy, as long as if I can send messages to it,
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:18.880]   I'll be happy.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.320]   Mobile C.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:26.920]   So there were seven, now there are six messaging apps.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:31.480]   - And Hangouts is apparently-- - Why did you ask to do--
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:33.200]   - The change logic is more. - It's really nice.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:35.600]   Okay, so now you can download-- - This was your choice.
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.120]   - Well, I'm just trying to move this show on,
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:38.400]   'cause we got K-K-4. - Yeah, I know.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.240]   You could have skipped it.
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.280]   - Well, no, I can't skip it.
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.840]   People say, where was the change log?
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:43.760]   - Oh. - Just 'cause you have a big
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:45.800]   while our three behind you doesn't mean you don't get to do
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:47.160]   not do the change log.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:51.560]   - We didn't do the change log for like two or three years.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.360]   - No, I know, but now once I've resurrected it,
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.240]   I can't kill it again.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.680]   - We resurrected the change, now we're slaves to it.
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:01.680]   - Google Go is a mere seven megabytes.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.760]   It's the light version of the Google search app
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.320]   intended for the Google Go operating system,
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:08.880]   but you can now download it.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.200]   If you want, on any Android phone in the US,
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.360]   it's in the Play Store.
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.680]   Or anywhere in the world.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.120]   - Light, it's light.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:17.920]   - But it's-- - But it remembers
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:20.240]   if you lose connectivity or remembers your searches.
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:22.640]   - Yeah, in fact, I don't know why anybody wouldn't use it.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.840]   Is there anything missing from it?
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.680]   Seven megabytes, it keeps your phones--
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.640]   - I use whatever in, sometimes I use--
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.440]   - Sometimes the clouds are probably not a standalone search app.
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:36.280]   - Well, yeah, but in Chrome, there's also a mobile
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:38.920]   or a data saving thing, and I turned all those on,
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.600]   and it's quite nice, actually.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:41.440]   - Yes.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.120]   I appreciate that.
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:46.520]   You can now, you'll appreciate this,
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:47.800]   now that you have a 13-year-old,
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:52.160]   you can assign reminders to family and friends
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:55.360]   from Google Assistant.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:59.160]   So you could say, "Hey, Google, remind Stacey
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.000]   "to take out the trash."
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.880]   - Oh, God, that would be so terrible.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.200]   My husband will abuse this.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.640]   No one tell him.
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:06.200]   No one. (laughs)
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.200]   - What's worse is you'll get a notification
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:10.920]   on your smart display speaker and phone.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.840]   - Ugh.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.680]   - Yeah, already I tell my husband.
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.320]   - And he will, Andrew will get notified
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:21.320]   at the exact time you asked your assistant to remind him,
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.440]   you can see which reminders you've assigned to your husband,
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:27.600]   or he can see which ones he's assigned to you, more like.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:30.240]   You can even say, "Hey, you know who,
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.280]   "what are my reminders for Stacey?"
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.040]   I like this, they'll be location-based reminders.
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:40.040]   So he can say, "Remind Stacey when she's at Chipotle,
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:45.040]   "not to eat the queso, that will pop up on your phone."
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:48.520]   - So those are actually, I did one of those.
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:51.880]   Well, I did an ifed reminder, it would send me a text
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:54.400]   anytime my husband passed the grocery store.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:55.240]   - Perfect.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.240]   - And well, no, it wasn't.
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:59.040]   In execution, the text was-
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:39:59.880]   - 'Cause by the time it was-
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.800]   - I'm by the grocery store, yeah.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:02.640]   - He was already gone.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:04.760]   - His privacy was majorly violent.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:06.400]   - Yes, well, I told him I was doing it.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:07.240]   And he was-
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.240]   - The grocery store.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.440]   Which is the name of the strip club in Seattle.
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.800]   You can-
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:17.880]   - You don't have to go to-
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.200]   - What do you guys hit the old-
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.040]   - I just want you to know.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.880]   - Please, let's sneak out of the table.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:26.400]   - Every town has a bar called The Office.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.240]   So that husbands, wayward husbands could say,
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:30.000]   "I'm going to the office."
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.320]   To protect your privacy, you can send and receive your mind.
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.960]   I tell you, I'm the guy.
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:37.800]   I'm the guy.
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:38.880]   (laughing)
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.800]   With the buttons.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:41.640]   You can-
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:43.240]   (laughing)
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.840]   You can send and receive reminders.
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:45.680]   - Oh, look, smoother!
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:46.520]   Yeah!
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:48.440]   - Your access a punch Leo button.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.560]   Thanks.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:51.600]   Okay.
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.160]   - You can send and receive reminders
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.160]   only from people who are in your Google family group
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:56.720]   or those who have their accounts linked
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.840]   to the same smart display as speakers you are
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.680]   and are voice matched.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:01.800]   So it's not going to be misused.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:04.000]   They also have to be in your Google contacts.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.920]   For parents who want to give their kids access
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.840]   to the assistant on Google Home,
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.200]   you can create account for kids under 13 through family link.
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:14.560]   And you can also block anyone
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.480]   from sending you reminders at any time.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:18.280]   So you could do that.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:19.120]   - Noted.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.120]   - Noted.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:20.960]   - Noted.
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:26.280]   I don't.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.680]   (laughing)
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:28.520]   - I'm not.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:31.040]   (laughing)
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.720]   - Carsten, I'm making an executive decision.
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:35.800]   (laughing)
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.000]   I'm the producer.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.520]   I just produced.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.240]   - Our show today brought to you back.
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.960]   I'm rapidly running out of steam.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.480]   I need some case I want to jar.
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:47.720]   Our show today rapidly brought to you by Kaptera.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.280]   You want to go there because it is the number one.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:53.320]   Number one, free online resource
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.560]   to help you find software for your business.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:58.240]   So many businesses are using old out of the date software
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.680]   or pencil and paper.
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:01.520]   No matter what you're doing,
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:03.160]   if you're running a hair salon,
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.960]   if you're looking for sales software,
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.560]   if you need project management software,
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:07.720]   email marketing software,
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.520]   if you're using software in business,
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.000]   Kaptera is a directory of the best.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.380]   You can search in 700 categories.
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:18.000]   You can narrow it down.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.720]   You can say, I only want to see you the ones
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.400]   with the five star ratings.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.800]   I only want to see them.
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:24.800]   If it does this or that.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:27.360]   And you can then,
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.240]   and this is the best part about Kaptera.
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.960]   You could, actually, before you do that,
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:34.360]   you can make a chart, a comparison chart
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.360]   up to four different apps.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:36.480]   But then you can do the best part,
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.120]   which is read the reviews.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:39.960]   Read the reviews.
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:44.240]   There's 975,000 actual reviews
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:46.040]   from real people using the software.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.840]   They've read it very carefully.
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:50.520]   So you are now going to be able to see what's out there
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.760]   and see what people were actually using it think.
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:54.960]   This is what you need.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:57.320]   No matter what kind of software your business needs,
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:00.800]   Kaptera makes it easy to discover the right solution fast.
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.520]   The reason there's 1,000 reviews every day
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.040]   is because millions of people use Kaptera
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:05.040]   every month.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.280]   And it's free.
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.320]   There's no charge.
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:09.760]   In fact, the only thing I'd suggest,
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.880]   if you try some software and you think well of it
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:14.280]   or poorly, relieve a review
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:16.120]   so that the next person knows,
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:19.560]   Kaptera believes software makes the world a better place
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.960]   'cause software can help every organization
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:25.960]   become a more efficient, effective version of itself.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:29.760]   Visit kaptera.com/tweig for free to free.
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:32.520]   Not freemium, not like we'll pay you pay later or anything.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.520]   No, it's just free.
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:36.640]   Get all the tools you need to make an informed decision
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:38.040]   for your business, Kaptera,
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:43.040]   C-A-P-T-E-W-R-A.com/tweig.
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:46.040]   Thank you, Kaptera for supporting Twig.
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:47.560]   Thank you, Twig listeners,
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:50.840]   for supporting us by using Kaptera.com/twig.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:54.640]   Kaptera is software selection simplified.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:44:00.000]   Stacey, you needn't, but you can, you may, if you wish.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.920]   Share something with us.
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:03.120]   Oh, I have something.
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:03.960]   Thank you.
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:06.520]   And it's not a picture of my dog.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:10.680]   It is the Fin, a newly launched product today
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:13.360]   called the Fin Smart Water Assistant.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.960]   This is interesting because Fin, a couple years ago,
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:21.400]   actually launched a water monitoring system with Upenor,
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:22.560]   which is a plumbing company.
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.400]   Spelting 500.
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.120]   P-H-Y-N.
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:27.600]   Oh, yes, P-H-Y-N.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:32.600]   And the fancy one turns off your water valve.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.400]   And it's actually really cool.
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:36.840]   I wanted it, but it's like $699.
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:38.280]   And it just felt like,
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:40.280]   if Plumber has to install it, it's too much.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.480]   It does that if there's a leak.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.840]   Right, if it detects a leak, it can auto shut off.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:45.680]   Nice.
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:47.120]   So this new product that was announced today
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.280]   and will be available in September
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.400]   is only $299.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.720]   It fits under your sink.
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:56.480]   It monitors all of your water
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.920]   so it can detect leaks that are like a sudden outflow
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:01.240]   of water from something.
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:03.000]   It can detect slow leaks.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.720]   It also can detect on a device by device,
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:08.080]   faucet by faucet or toilet by toilet basis.
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:09.960]   Oh, this is incredible. Who's using water?
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:11.360]   Oh my gosh.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.760]   You can self install it.
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:16.240]   And for $300, that sort of leak detection,
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:19.080]   'cause a lot of the point leak sensors,
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:21.240]   they cost between $30 and $40
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:23.440]   for like the type of leak sensors
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:24.640]   you might stick under your sink.
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:25.840]   And you have to put them everywhere.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:29.720]   This one is one unit that does it for the whole house.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:30.560]   Yes.
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:31.920]   Wow. How does it know?
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:36.920]   It algorithms, it measures the water flow.
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:39.080]   It understands water flow.
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:40.440]   And it also can detect actually,
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:43.120]   this is interesting because it is measuring water flow.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:44.920]   If your pipes start to freeze,
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.280]   it will actually send you an alert
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.320]   because that's gonna also impact water flow.
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:51.080]   This is a really good example of how software
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:53.840]   can make stuff do pretty amazing things.
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:54.800]   Is it AI? It is pretty.
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.880]   Is it trained? How does it...
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:02.600]   Yeah, I mean, they've trained a model on...
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.240]   Yes. But do we call that...
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.320]   I call that AI.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:07.160]   No, no, no.
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.280]   So if you think about it,
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.840]   knowing this unit that's one place in your house
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:14.480]   could tell how much water is coming out of that faucet,
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:18.240]   how would it know unless you set up a system
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:19.760]   and you gave it a lot of data
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:22.120]   and you said this is what it looks like, right?
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.960]   Yes. I mean, that's what they have done.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:24.960]   Yes, they have tons of...
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:25.800]   It's rules based, but the...
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:26.920]   So that's what I call AI.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:27.760]   If it's a rules based,
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:30.640]   but not because some programmer said if this than that,
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.080]   but because a model was created by training.
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:36.960]   I think that's AI.
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:39.320]   No, not AI.
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:42.240]   Okay, I mean, that's how you come up with...
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:44.480]   That's how you come up with all kinds of algorithms, right?
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:49.080]   Does AI have to learn going forward too to make it AI?
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:52.200]   That's a really philosophical question
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:53.800]   I don't have the answer to.
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.800]   Okay, Burke says it's not AI, so...
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:56.800]   Okay, never mind.
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:01.360]   I'm like, I don't think of it as AI.
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:04.280]   I just think of it as like a nominally detection.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:05.440]   Here's why I call it AI,
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:09.040]   because until recently, this was a hard...
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:10.280]   This isn't something you could say,
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:12.360]   "Oh, I can write the code that will know
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:15.680]   if that faucet down 100 feet away is leaking."
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:18.240]   You had to have some much more sophisticated techniques
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.360]   to figure that out.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:20.360]   This is where...
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:22.320]   This is what I mean by software is changing,
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.240]   is gonna change things.
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:25.680]   That's amazing if it works.
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:27.600]   Yeah, no, this is a very cool product.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.680]   I'm getting a review unit.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:30.760]   You will have to have...
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:33.640]   So to install it, you have to put it under your kitchen sink,
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:35.640]   and you'll have to install a little sensor
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.920]   on your hot water line and your cold water line,
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:40.160]   and you need an outlet to plug it in under your sink,
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.760]   which most people will have if they have
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.280]   a garbage disposal or a dishwasher.
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:45.400]   Here's what they say.
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:49.040]   Developed over a decade by machine learning researchers
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.040]   at the University of Washington and Belkin.
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:52.360]   I was Belkin.
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.200]   Finns...
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:54.280]   Oh, yeah, Finn, yeah.
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:56.560]   Finns proprietary leak detection technology
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.360]   utilizes high definition ultrasonic sensors
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:03.240]   to sample the pressure in your plumbing system 240 times
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.880]   every second.
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:06.560]   This produces an unparalleled view
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:10.080]   of the unique signatures of each fixture in your home.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.120]   So it doesn't put sensors all over your house, right?
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:14.600]   But it's listening and it knows,
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:16.880]   oh, that faucet sounds like...
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:18.920]   And that faucet sounds like...
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:21.480]   And though it knows that way.
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:23.880]   Yes.
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:24.720]   Oh.
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:27.960]   I call it AI.
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:31.360]   But you might just call it amazing.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.280]   Oh, Lord.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:34.680]   (laughs)
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:36.880]   If fingerprints your fixtures,
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:38.280]   when you run a bath, wash your hands,
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:39.400]   or water your lawn,
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:40.880]   the pressure in your system changes.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:41.720]   Yes.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.080]   Burke points out, you can put your ear to the pipe.
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:44.160]   You know somebody's running the water.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:45.000]   Yes.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.440]   But Finn measures these microscopic changes
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:49.520]   in water pressure to fingerprint
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:52.920]   the unique pressure profile of each fixture in your home.
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:57.040]   Well, a friend of mine did a business
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:59.600]   where he did that through all of your electric sockets
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.320]   and everything that was plugged into them.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.160]   They all have unique...
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.440]   There's a company called Sense does that?
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:04.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.680]   I actually had a box you could put there that says that's...
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:07.360]   So all these things have...
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.080]   They have signatures.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.760]   Yeah, they're all unique.
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.640]   Google+, I think, is doing something with that.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:16.560]   He's installed with the memory
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:19.480]   of hundreds of thousands of toilet flushes.
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:24.000]   Laundry loads and pike leaks from the real homes of beta testers,
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.680]   which serve as a baseline
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:27.240]   for when something's routine or something's wrong.
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:29.200]   From there, Finn starts to learn
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:32.000]   how water is uniquely used in your home,
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.480]   asking occasional questions to improve accuracy over the time.
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:37.880]   Was that you flushing or were you in the hot tub?
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:40.760]   I think that's AI.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.120]   Okay, that is AI.
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:43.520]   Okay, thank you.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:44.360]   That is AI.
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:46.320]   I did not understand that was what it was doing.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:48.160]   It is definitely AI.
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.000]   I win.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.560]   'Cause it's running a model and it's updating that model.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:52.920]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.160]   You do not win a cupcake.
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.920]   (laughing)
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:56.760]   Okay.
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:00.120]   Anyway, so this is for three hundred bucks.
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:01.280]   This is amazing.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.120]   I am.
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:02.960]   It's very exciting.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:03.800]   Oh, that is amazing.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:05.680]   So I'm gonna test it out.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:06.520]   Okay.
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:07.360]   I'll let you know how it works.
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:08.360]   I'll have to create a leak.
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:10.640]   So if you want to automatically shut off...
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:11.960]   If you want to automatically shut off,
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.120]   you need the $700 model.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:13.960]   But if you don't mind,
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.360]   if you just get a pop up on your phone,
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:16.640]   you could use the $300 model.
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:18.720]   Yes, and if you buy the more expensive model,
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.240]   you need a plumber to come install it
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:22.000]   because you're gonna install it on your main water line
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:22.840]   outside your house.
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.000]   You also need Wi-Fi access outside your house.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.400]   You'll be the only person in Seattle
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.160]   that actually has one 'cause it doesn't freeze there.
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.000]   No.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.960]   'Cause yeah, that's a big thing.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:31.840]   No, no, no, I mean, this is...
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:34.680]   In, you know, Bedminster, that's huge.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:36.520]   There's lots of comedy.
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:39.160]   I mean, my old house had a bunch of slow leaks.
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:41.360]   I mean, this is a water leak survey.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:43.120]   Slow leaks are an issue.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:46.720]   My mom found out that she, her studio,
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:48.120]   which was outside the house,
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:52.080]   had been leaking gallons a minute for months.
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:53.080]   She should have hit a water bill.
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:54.400]   Yeah, that's actually really common.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:58.160]   When I was in college,
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:00.080]   we left a toilet running in the basement.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:00.920]   We didn't know.
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:04.240]   We were never down there and the landlady wasn't happy.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:05.080]   It's very easy.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:06.760]   That can happen easily.
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.600]   You know, you flush it,
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:09.440]   but it doesn't quite come up in a continuously run.
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:10.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.320]   I think this is good.
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:14.120]   This is gonna save water and we need water.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:16.040]   We need more water.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.360]   It's the Internet of toilets.
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:19.760]   Thank you.
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:21.760]   Thank you.
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:22.400]   I think it's a toilet.
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:23.560]   I thought that was okay.
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:28.120]   Would you like Jeff Jarvis to give us a number?
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:30.760]   Please not, please.
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:35.080]   So I'm just in Silicon Valley.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:37.360]   And whenever I drive up the 101,
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:40.600]   I love seeing the hangar one.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:41.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:42.600]   From the former off the field.
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:44.880]   Yeah, it is cool to see it's built.
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:47.560]   So Google has controlled this,
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:48.760]   not quite owned but controlled it
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:50.760]   because they can not land their jets on the left and field
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:53.520]   next to their offices, near their offices.
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:59.160]   And the Navy was never knew what to do with this huge, huge hangar.
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:01.440]   And now Google says they have a plan to clean it up.
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:02.280]   They don't know what it's gonna go in.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:04.480]   It was built in 1933.
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:07.320]   The floor alone covers eight acres
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:11.000]   can accommodate six American football fields.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.400]   You could build entire buildings within it.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:19.240]   It gets fog near the ceiling at times.
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:23.000]   So they're gonna do something with this amazing thing.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.520]   And you see it every day you go by on 101.
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:28.240]   So I think it could be Google's biggest ad.
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:29.000]   It could be something else.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.320]   Could be some kind of research center.
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:31.160]   I don't know what it will be,
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:31.960]   but they're gonna clean it up
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:34.160]   and they're gonna make it into something.
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.040]   What a toxic waste to get rid of.
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:39.800]   That's not the hangar where Sir Gabrine was building his blimps.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:42.160]   And don't think so.
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:45.400]   'Cause those are all those old blimp hangers.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:49.760]   And he actually has a company to bring back blimps.
[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:50.600]   Derigibles.
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:51.440]   Derigibles.
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:53.120]   This time--
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:54.280]   Is it derigibles?
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.520]   There's a distinction between a blimp and a derigible.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:58.560]   I can't remember what it is.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.640]   But this time, let's not use hydrogen.
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:01.800]   Okay, I'm just saying.
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:04.960]   I think Carson was gonna bring us a bit of--
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:05.960]   All blimp, all blimp.
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:06.800]   All blimp, all blimp.
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:07.640]   All blimp, all blimp, all blimp.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:09.720]   But not all, all derigibles.
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:10.840]   A syllogism.
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:15.680]   All blimps are derigibles, but not all derigibles are blimps.
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:17.360]   Homers, uplands.
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:18.760]   Some are siblings.
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:21.000]   (laughing)
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:26.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Harvard education
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:27.160]   in a nutshell.
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:30.320]   Congratulations to Taylor Lawrence,
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:31.720]   who is moving from the Atlantic
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:34.360]   where she did such great reporting to the New York Times,
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:36.320]   where she will continue to do great reporting,
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:37.600]   including this tweet.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:40.600]   You've seen this, we've seen this over and over again.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:42.720]   Instagram is about to take over
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:45.600]   and all of your stuff will belong to them.
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:49.520]   And then so people respond to it with a tweet
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:50.520]   or an Instagram post.
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:52.360]   I do not give Instagram or any entities
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:53.520]   associated with Instagram permission
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:55.520]   to use my pictures, information or pictures.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.240]   With this statement, I give notice to Instagram.
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:53:58.280]   It's strictly forbidden.
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:01.560]   This has been making the rounds again.
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:02.640]   It's not gonna happen.
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:03.480]   It's a hoax.
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.320]   Look who fell for it.
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:07.660]   Judd Apatow, Julianne Moore, Julia Roberts,
[01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:10.080]   Deborah Messing, Tara G. P. Henson,
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:14.480]   Beyonce's mother, Waka Waka Flame,
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:19.320]   and the Secretary of Energy,
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:20.720]   Governor Rick Perry.
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:23.520]   - Oh no.
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:26.160]   - The man in charge of our nuclear weapons program.
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:28.420]   (laughing)
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:33.920]   So I just, a little reminder.
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:37.080]   You don't have to post something that says Instagram
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:39.720]   doesn't have permission to share my messages or posts.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:41.080]   - You don't have to.
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:43.440]   That's from 2012, that thing.
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:44.600]   It just doesn't die.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.120]   Here's the Rick Perry's post.
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:49.720]   Don't forget, tomorrow starts the new Instagram rule.
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:52.000]   Don't forget.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.340]   (laughing)
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:58.720]   And the channel 13 news that everybody quotes.
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.940]   No, that's made up.
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:03.080]   That's made up.
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:05.160]   Somebody somewhere is just chortling.
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:06.240]   - Oh God.
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:10.760]   - I think Carston has something to show you now.
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:11.600]   - I do.
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:16.440]   I have a new, what I'd like to make a--
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:18.480]   - Do we need to explain it first, Carston?
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:23.120]   - This is Carston's fan video of the week.
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:26.440]   A couple weeks ago, we had a fan,
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:28.200]   a fan found a video,
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:31.440]   well a studio crew found a video,
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:36.280]   with Jeff Jarvis apparently causing a car crash.
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.040]   Oh yes, that was good, yes.
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:38.880]   - That was good, yes.
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:41.000]   - This one, okay, the car crash was not good.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.440]   - He wasn't in the car.
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.440]   Somebody was listening to--
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:45.440]   - To Howard Stern.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:47.080]   - To Howard Stern on Jeff.
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:49.400]   And that incidental audio was on the video
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:51.240]   of getting him getting rear ended.
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:53.200]   Anyway, so we watched that a couple of weeks ago.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:54.680]   - And they used this to make fun of Jeff
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:55.640]   going over bridges.
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:56.480]   - Yes.
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:57.960]   - 'Cause they could want to go bridge to get there.
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:02.960]   - Last week, we wanted to show a video of Bill and I
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:05.960]   talking about Chromebooks.
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:07.760]   - Yes, 'cause he's a big Chromebook fan now, right?
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:09.560]   - And he did a three minute video.
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:12.840]   - Yes, but I didn't want to show the video
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.680]   because I didn't want us getting taken down.
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:19.080]   - There is lately YouTube's been doing a lot of takedowns.
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:21.160]   I thought other people's behest,
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.280]   I don't think YouTube does it on a map,
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:24.080]   but it's the content detection.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:27.000]   And so it hurts us a lot because when we,
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.640]   a lot of people watch our shows on YouTube
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:30.200]   and when the show's taken down
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.560]   and usually it's a fairly lengthy like six week takedown,
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:34.680]   we lose all that revenue.
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:39.200]   - So, Jeff was good enough to watch the video
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:41.640]   and narrate for us.
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:43.600]   - I know, I didn't just narrate.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.080]   I dramatized it.
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:48.280]   - You dramatized it, yes.
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:49.920]   - So instead of watching the video,
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:52.400]   we're now gonna do an audio reenactment.
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.320]   - But it gets better.
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:58.680]   - But there's now a twig listener viewer
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:03.680]   has created a deep fake video of Jeff Jarvis
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:05.440]   as Bill Nye.
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:07.520]   - And this, we have the rights to use.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.440]   - This, they could probably take us down
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:11.720]   because we're using their video.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:14.760]   I don't know, it's this is, this is.
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:16.360]   - So it's given credit to the first two.
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:17.200]   - But it's dirted.
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:18.040]   - This is worth it.
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:18.880]   - Who did this?
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:20.680]   - Hi, I'm geeky Bill Nye.
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:22.040]   Trust me, 'cause I'm the video.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:22.880]   - We need the video.
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:23.880]   - I'm gonna have a,
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:24.720]   - Wow.
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:27.600]   - Dorton, and things are gonna move behind me regularly.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:29.840]   And I'm gonna talk about what's the topic here.
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:32.480]   Oh, windows and how slow windows is.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:33.760]   And I'm gonna go to this car.
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:34.960]   This really beat up car,
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:36.920]   which has a funny windows license plate on it.
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:39.400]   And I'm gonna say, but I love this car.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:40.920]   I don't wanna leave this car.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.160]   Even though the car is out of date,
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:43.800]   it's a mess and it's got tape all over it.
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:44.720]   Oh, there it goes.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:45.800]   The part of it falls off.
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:47.040]   I put the tape back on.
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.040]   I get in the car.
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:49.480]   It explodes.
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:50.320]   - This is nice.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:52.240]   - You shouldn't be on old things like windows.
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:53.160]   You should get a nice--
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:55.040]   - Is this an ad paid for by Google?
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.360]   - This is a Chromebook ad.
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:57.600]   - Oh, this is me.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:58.920]   - The Chromebook is already born.
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:57:59.760]   - I know it's you.
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.280]   - Now I'm gonna pull on a Hawaiian shirt
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:03.360]   and there's gonna be a scene from why behind me.
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:04.800]   And I can't remember why--
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:06.760]   - Look at your hair is actually ruffling.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:07.840]   - I'm trying to teach you, but it doesn't matter.
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:10.160]   All I'm gonna do is take real time to buy a Chromebook.
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:13.520]   - And who did that?
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:14.440]   - That was--
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.280]   - That was--
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:16.640]   - Ziv Zoolander.
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:19.160]   - Ziv Zoolander, that can't be his real name.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:21.920]   (laughing)
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:26.280]   - Ziv Zoolander taking footage from Twig
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:29.680]   and putting it on top of a Google Chromebook.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.560]   - But I'm telling you, what's the software?
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:32.400]   How did he do that?
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:33.680]   - The lip sync was good.
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:35.600]   He's be apologized on-- - He apologized on--
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:38.480]   - On YouTube for being his first deep fake.
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:39.600]   I was very impressed.
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:41.400]   - Yes, he says first deep fake video,
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:43.520]   so excuse the poor quality.
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:45.800]   Also I didn't have time to run more iterations
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:48.080]   or run properly and I'm not that experienced
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:49.840]   with editing or premiere.
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:53.040]   Done for the This Week in Google podcast on the Twig--
[01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:53.880]   - Twig--
[01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:54.720]   - Yeah, he's a--
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:56.480]   - So I thought they pulled that deep fake software,
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:58.160]   but I guess either he has it.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000]   - His video in our show notes.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.720]   - Oh, here's-- - So everyone can--
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:10.200]   - Here's how GitHub is a tool called deep face lab
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:13.440]   that is available for download for free
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:16.640]   that utilizes machine learning to replace faces in video.
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:18.440]   I wonder if you use that. - But I don't understand.
[01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:20.080]   He got it, I mean, the hair blue,
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:21.440]   but he also got angles.
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:23.040]   - No, the hair blowing-- - You don't hear the show.
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:25.040]   - The hair blowing-- - Was Bill Nye's hair.

[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:49.960]   I feel like that's a good test.
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:50.800]   - That's a perfect test.
