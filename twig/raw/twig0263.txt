[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.960]   It's got to bring wash them today. That was the beginning of the school year
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.260]   That's exciting
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260]   Gina you have new art behind you. Oh
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.200]   Yeah, I'm in the other conference room that has wired internet because I wanted Skype to behave so yeah, I guess
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:12.240]   My whiteboards looking a little yellow though, so I don't know wait a minute look who else is here Mike Elgin our news director from
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.240]   I was just using the table
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.520]   I was sitting at the table in the show broke out Mike is here actually because you were writing a little bit about trolls yes and
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.120]   Jeff wanted to I think was Jeff wanted to talk about your I said well
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.860]   Let's get Mike on the show he is just across the way and I think I think Jeff and I both probably
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.040]   I'm guessing on Jeff's part, but I know on my part that we want to talk about the troll right to be forgotten
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.560]   Terrorist video Nexus
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.980]   Oh God, so he's so this is gonna be a depressing show
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:55.420]   Before we do that let's start let's just get a little device catch up because before the show Gina was wondering
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.720]   Jeff how the experiment is going to experiments Jeff's engaged in one no computer Chromebook only and
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.360]   That's still in effect right
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.040]   That's still doing fine. I was fearing ten minutes ago that I was gonna have to go out and get an apple because we had no sound
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.320]   And then I realized I hadn't played my kids. Oh, that does help
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.240]   Good so he's able to use a level of my expertise here folks
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.240]   So if you judge my experience accordingly
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.600]   He's able to use a Chromebook to do everything in a tablet and and a smartphone and the smartphone is still a one plus one
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.080]   It is indeed you didn't return it and it's it's no
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.440]   I did not it's it's it's going all of Sun Jake sitting here makes fun of it because he thinks it's like a you know
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.680]   That my weekly reader of phones. He thinks it's too big
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.560]   Always be too big, but I make fun of his little tiny little tiny apple
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.600]   I think the whole I think the whole company is a publicity stunt. I can't figure it out
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.920]   They still are not selling this you still have to get an invite
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.400]   I got one more thanks to one of our fans who said do you still need an invite?
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.020]   I said, you know what I would love one because I stole Jason's one plus one Jason
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.080]   How considering is the host of all about and I probably should have one so we did get thank you today
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.540]   We got our one plus one for Jason. Oh, I got it. I got the update. There was an update automatic update
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.160]   Which I got four four four ticket. Yeah, and then and then it
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.120]   The one thing I can't get it to do now
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.040]   Gina is I how so proud that I had my separate lock screen from my wallpaper screen
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.440]   Yeah, you know, yeah, I lost it
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.280]   Well, you can add third-party lock screen apps
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.280]   I guess but the yeah now the lock screen the way signage and mod works the lock screen is the same as the wallpaper for you
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.040]   But why could I do it fine just before the update?
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.000]   Hmm
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.120]   Could you are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure I showed you last week. I showed you Lenin and then I showed you Marx and Engels. That's right
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.440]   I guess and now if I say
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.640]   Now if I say hold on a second here
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:06.520]   Lock screen custom lock screen. Okay, so now I'm gonna go off and now what it's gonna do is this
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.560]   It gives me that ugly box. Yeah, I don't like that ugly box
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.440]   Right and so then as I as I do the code it's gonna go. Whoa, there's Lenin then it goes to Marx. Yeah
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.160]   Yeah, you can get third party lock screen apps. I'm sure if you watch all about Android the gang over there
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.400]   I'll tell you yeah, let's do it. Yeah, we just plain blaming on communism
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.280]   Yeah spoils everything. Yeah, I don't I don't have the answer to that. Just be glad you didn't have a Trotsky screen
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.560]   You know the two that you know about the double tap to wake and double-tack to sleep, right?
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.080]   Love I love that love that and they fixed that ridiculous
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.660]   But it's like my favorite feature of the phone is that I don't have to search for the power button to unlock it
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.860]   And remember when Jason reviewed it he and you I think even mentioned this the both of you had problems that it would turn itself on in your pocket
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.060]   That's one of the things they fix in the update
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.760]   Is it oh yes, it now has a proxy sex's proximity and says oh, it's in your pocket
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.760]   Well, I'm not gonna turn on that was just a
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:12.160]   Excellent and that applies to the the torch as well. Yep. That's good because the torch was the issue no the flash
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.860]   Leo shining breast
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:26.440]   So Gina you last time we talked we're kind of thinking about giving this thing up sending it back because of your disgust
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:34.420]   Over their plan to market to women. I was I was very frustrated with their ineptitude and the marketing department. Yes
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:40.340]   They for everybody knows the story probably by now, but just if you case you don't they one plus
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.020]   Post to the contest is how you get it you either have to get somebody to give you an invitation
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.060]   Somebody already has when none of us have invitations because we all got it from somebody else
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.100]   But if you know somebody who got it
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:58.900]   You they have invitations more likely though you're gonna participate in a contest the most recent contest posted on the one plus forums was
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:06.220]   Ladies we want you to jump the line take a picture of yourself with the one plus logo on your body
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.500]   And then the forum will rate you all and the top rated
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.020]   Ladies will get an invitation by the phone at full price
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.460]   And no nudity, please
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.980]   But something close to it was a desire. I don't well and then I talked to Tony way
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.980]   I thought maybe this is cultural because remember they're a Chinese company
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.420]   yeah, and
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.340]   China the mainland China is considerably more prudish than the rest of the West
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:42.620]   And I thought and Tony kind of said you know you see people with a company logos on themselves all the time
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.300]   On their hands on their arms on their faces
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.940]   It does not necessarily mean that they thought people would take sexy pictures
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:56.080]   The the marketing wasn't in Mandarin. They're trying to market to English speaking people
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.060]   They should have known better and it was women only
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.740]   I mean if they said post a picture of anybody post a picture of yourself with like creative use of our logo
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.540]   It would have been a totally different story and then reading people on the forum is actually really
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.340]   Rehensing everything this company has done has been sleazy first of all this is
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.900]   First of all, this is Oppo. This is the idea that it's the one plus is a separate company is
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:25.140]   Not true. I've said as much. It's yeah, it's Oppo executives one plus one oddly enough is OPO
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:32.220]   And basically they said oh, we're gonna do a fresh new start where we're going to launch this new company and then it turned out that
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:38.500]   Their domain name is owned by the company. It turned out that the sole owners Oppo and then they said oh no no
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:44.300]   There's two Oppos. There's Oppo the investment company on Oppo the mobile company might be and the inventual
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:49.140]   It's not true, but the investment company supposedly owns both companies or invested in both companies
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:55.620]   But I can't find any evidence for that and there's tons of evidence that in fact it's the same company
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:02.100]   So they pretty much lied about that as far as I can tell then their first big marketing stunt was that they said okay
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:08.180]   Smash your old phone, right and people misunderstood and they started smashing their phones expecting to be put on the list for an invitation
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.980]   That's not how the contest worked you had to get the invitation first and then you had to smash the phone
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:21.580]   It was dangerous environmentally insensitive and just wasteful and horrible then they came out to this with this ladies night essentially
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:27.620]   For invitations where they were trying to what they wanted was what the outcome they wanted was a bunch of of
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:36.220]   Women with the the one plus one or one plus logo on their bodies out there on the internet as a viral campaign and they
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.660]   Specified women they haven't done a single thing that isn't sleazy
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:48.820]   Not one it was true the their marketing department is clearly clearly inept but and I hate to defend them
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:53.060]   But you know I when we talk about bugs and software particularly open soft open-source software, you know
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.460]   I've always said like bugs are gonna happen. It's about how you respond
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.980]   And I do and I do believe that and and to their
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.660]   Credit within hours. They pulled the ladies first contest
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:11.380]   Apologized asked about women and tech organizations now great. I'm still I'm totally with you Mike
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:17.740]   Like their marketing department is completely inept like terrible terrible ideas terrible ideas and certainly I mean, you know
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.940]   Maybe brilliant ideas if they're subscribing to the any presses good press
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:28.580]   Maxim because they're getting us talking about it, but you know look they they they they apologize they pulled it and
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:35.140]   You know look if I had if I returned every device that I had some sort of you know ethical more problem with the way that it was
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:40.660]   Produced I wouldn't have any technology. I feel like so in the end I decided to keep my one plus one
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.260]   And to just be vocal about how bad the contest was
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.380]   Because I actually think it's a really great phone and I love it
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.300]   Sanogen it was interesting to see cyanogen make a statement about the contest
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.500]   because
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.500]   The energy came out straight up came out and said we don't support any contest that objectify people period
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.780]   And that's interesting
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.620]   Sanogen doesn't have the best history of being the most inclusive or sensitive company either
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.060]   But I think when these kinds of things happens
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:14.700]   Conversations happen and I think that's useful and again look I might be a nerd that's just trying to justify because I actually really do like this phone
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.260]   I mean, I think this company actually makes a really good phone
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.860]   Well
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:26.780]   It's probably not better than a number of other flagship phones from other manufacturers, but it's 350 bucks
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:32.860]   It's not better than this what this is is the Oppo find seven. Well, that's what I think and I was running cyanogen
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.860]   This is this is what puzzles me
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:41.260]   What is the what is the strategy to get attention they created the fine
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.060]   They created this whole fiction that there are this innovative new company, right?
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.980]   basically what they did was they created a fiction around an existing product and
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.380]   We're all being pumped
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.060]   Yeah, I got used yeah
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.460]   Yeah, so we could have just gotten got out and bought the fine
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.780]   I guess I'm 7 a maybe the fine 7 isn't as affordable and it doesn't run cyanogen
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.780]   It doesn't have a denim a denim off and in the back
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.580]   I don't know if you'd call it denim
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.100]   I know they do are they are going to be coming out with the denim okay back and they they're gonna have bamboo and stuff like that
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.980]   but so there there are some unique things about it the price is fantastic the phone is great and the
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:23.780]   Cyanogen is great all that stuff is those are the real things but but they could have you know if they would have done just another
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.060]   Oppo phone in the Oppo line with all these features
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.620]   Nobody would be talking about it. So it worked
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:36.060]   but is it all marketing a fiction though on some level I mean you know like I
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.340]   Don't know I don't know
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.220]   Not like this. I mean this is this is it's bad marketing when
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:49.620]   People catch you lying or they catch you doing stuff. That's offensive or you know
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:55.420]   That's not that's bad marketing. So that you know if you're gonna yes publicity stunts are great viral campaigns are great, but don't
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.780]   Blow it like this. I still don't get what the angle is
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:06.700]   publicize who exactly what we've just done we've just talked about yeah, but to what end you still can't
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:15.220]   If they had this for sale at wide widespread for sale, I'd understand yeah, but they don't Jason how will and I were talking about this on tech news today
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.380]   Just say this is the best phone for under $300 and we'll all buy it
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:25.820]   It's it really is the best phone you can get for under $300 as far as I know it is and you don't need to you don't need
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.980]   sexist contests and you know smashing phones and things like that yeah
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:35.420]   But if they're like if they're losing money on it, then they're not gonna come out with this broadly at this price
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.220]   So there's another trick to irritate you probably coming. Yeah
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:47.300]   They say yeah, we don't have any more, but guess what the fine seven is the same. Yeah thing
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:56.380]   That's what I I speculated that a few weeks ago on this show and then I pulled back because I thought that's really uncharitable
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:05.460]   But maybe they deserve it. I don't know I just I don't if you look at the aspect comparison
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.140]   There are differences the screens are different
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:16.100]   Materials ones IPS ones LPTS. There are a few differences signage and mods a huge difference and frankly
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.340]   I'd prefer signage and mod to whatever version of Android
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:25.900]   Oppo is selling I like Oppo's a good company the Oppo Blu-ray player was for years the best Blu-ray player in the market
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.340]   Yeah, they still be I mean I have the feeling and this is just again total guesswork
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.380]   This is not anything based on real information
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:38.220]   But I have the feeling that they really did want to come out with a super innovative phone and said to themselves
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.260]   How can we really drive home the point that this is different? This is completely different
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:48.520]   Cyanogen mod low price all these other features and benefits. How can we do that and then they constructed this?
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.860]   Let's just create a phony baloney startup out of this thing
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:58.380]   But at some point they're gonna need to sell it or there's no then they've get that but then there's no point to any of this
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:03.340]   Yeah, they need to sell it in a widespread fashion. Yeah, and or you could okay
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.940]   Let's go crazy
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:11.900]   If I were Adam Curry, I'd say this is remember Oppo's a Chinese company for all we know could be run by the Chinese government or have
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.020]   Influenced be by the Chinese military. Maybe this is just a great spy
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.780]   Device and we are all using it
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:25.180]   We just want to get into CUNY it could be the only device that the Chinese
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:32.060]   Government isn't using to spy on us. I never know we have just as another fan. Okay. We're gonna do it again
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.040]   Another fan has offered us the new phone from
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.780]   Who was it Jason
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.700]   Shao me
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.420]   Shao me nice to have him right there. So me four
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.380]   So we're gonna get one of those that's that's the company Hugo Barra went to yeah
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:57.700]   Also Chinese government run actually this was actually owned by the military believe yeah, the Chinese government loves Apple
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.740]   Very curious what's going on here?
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:07.420]   It does it's wonderful. It's a great mystery
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:13.380]   But you know what it's also a great phone and now everybody I know has one I want the denim one
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:18.020]   I'm holding out for the denim. I'm holding out. I'll tell you what I'll give you this one when the X plus one comes out
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:25.180]   Okay, September 4th Motorola has an event. I suspect is Motorola's Lenovo does not yet own Motorola. That's correct
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:29.940]   It's still Google right so this is your last chance to get a Google Motorola phone September 4th
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.980]   They'll probably ship the 360 and the X plus one or whatever they call it
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.500]   Yeah, we're announce it and I presume ships soon
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.940]   Yeah, because iPhone comes up five days later. So you better really yeah
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:48.020]   They said that for those who went to Google IO you have until September 5th to send in your address for sending for getting the
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:53.460]   Three so they're probably gonna start shipping on the fifth of the six or something like that for the motor 360. Oh, that's a good little
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.660]   Yeah, yeah, so you're gonna get one right you you're all gonna get one you've all we're
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.860]   Very happy to fill out that form by shipping address. Yes
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.540]   Complaining I didn't notice it until people complained
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:12.420]   About the black bar at the bottom of the well, it's just the screen doesn't they need the screen needs a electronic
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:19.060]   Base to throw up all those pictures. I want to thank you for pointing it out now. I can't appreciate the thing
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.140]   I ruined it for you. Wait wait the black bar at the bottom of what? Oh
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.580]   Screen doesn't go to the bottom see that oh
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.180]   That's now that's all I see it's Algens fault. Sorry
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.180]   You are just raining on our parade
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:41.740]   Now you can see it on all the screens there's uh, how did no one noticed that before well
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.900]   Apparently people did just not because mostly they use this shot which is a black face
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:52.860]   You know, right? I think even there. I think the illusion is close enough and I don't think it's gonna
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.860]   be on the end
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:05.940]   Oh, that's not sure. We're gonna get into the definition of troll. That's not trolling. That's called annoying. It's called telling the truth
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:15.100]   I still won't and actually it might be Gruber that was the one that first brought to my attention because he said it looks like a flat tire
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:21.820]   Now I really can't unsee it of course Gruber's thank you Gruber. Yeah, oh
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.820]   Gruber
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.820]   Flating everybody's time
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:36.340]   But the the unspoken point that Gruber's making is that Apple would never do that and they probably wouldn't oh that's focused it wouldn't they would be so
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:41.100]   You know obsessed with every little detail. They wouldn't have a black bar for
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:46.900]   What are you gonna do? You got some of their limitations in the world you got limitations
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:52.220]   Holding out hoping that when that thing ships that black bar isn't there. It's gonna be there. Why does
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:58.580]   Read an explanation it has something to do with when you have a you can't have a completely
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.540]   Bezel list you have to have some real estate
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.060]   One edge of a screen like this and you need a certain amount
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:10.860]   So they wanted to make this the watch as small as they could and this was the compromise they came to whereas they need the
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:15.060]   Screen electronics needs, you know a bit of it there at the bottom
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.180]   That's a terrible explanation. There's a good explanation out there, but
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:24.540]   It's a it's a technical where the gut is technology. It's where the guts goes. I
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:31.060]   Can't wait until Ron on all about Android talk we talk about this with him because he's been all about the round screen
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:40.500]   So
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.500]   Painful
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:49.540]   Alright alright alright class of course you know this is this is a
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.100]   Luisey K moment
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.100]   Everything is wonderful
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:59.460]   Nobody's happy about the black bar round screens were amazing
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.020]   But everyone's upset about the bar you're wearing a wristwatch
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.900]   It'll tell you your flight is delayed and the traffic's gonna take an extra 10 minutes
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.580]   So relax and you are complaining about a black bar at the bottom
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.780]   Come on
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:21.100]   Mike Elgin who continues to write for what?
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:27.860]   What are you showing? This is a this is the original post that's a close-up showing that in the black mode where it's been enhanced
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:32.500]   It just said enhancing anyway, so you actually posted this at Google plus months ago
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.300]   Four months ago. Yeah
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.900]   Shut up. Yeah
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.900]   That's why that's why my big big
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.660]   That's why everyone hates me because I'm the bearer of bad news
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.300]   So Mike writes for computer world and his spirit is copious free time
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.580]   He has none. I don't know when you would for in the morning. He's writing these articles. I think
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:57.020]   And on August 16th you did a piece called the trouble with trolls and how to beat them
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:03.100]   We all know the trolling problems serious. We've actually spoken about it twice on the last two episodes of this week in Google Gina
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.420]   talked about
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:12.380]   Issues people were having with being harassed on Twitter and the lack of interest Twitter had fixing the problem
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.380]   And until it was a celebrity until it was Zelda Williams Robin Williams daughter and now oh
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.100]   Now it's a problem. Oh
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.500]   But I don't know that I mean they're saying they're making the right noises out of their mouth
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:30.020]   But I don't know if there's an easy fix for this last week. We talked about collaborative filters as a possible
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:37.460]   solution or perhaps adding a feature that you could say I don't want to hear from anybody whose account is less than a month old or whatever
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:45.660]   Twitter is a particularly problematic place because of the nature of Twitter and Jeff you've been bitching about professor
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.700]   Jeff Jarvis you didn't have to say his name did you?
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:54.500]   You know I looked at the account. I don't understand how anybody could think that that was you the guys were
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:59.540]   Because here's the case. Here's the case. No, here's the case. Well, people put up silly pictures on Twitter pictures
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.220]   So these my name I can't imagine you doing that. It shouldn't be your name. I agree
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.780]   It is my name and that is the problem and so
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.820]   Out of nowhere. He went on and attacked
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:16.420]   Nossum-Tallum who is very prominent author and economist. I've met him. I have mutual friends
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.900]   He could attack some now you don't expect
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.060]   Toe-Tallum to have to stop and do it do a textual and
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:30.740]   Diographical analysis of who this is well somebody with his name is coming in and and and is attacking and Tallum goes back
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:36.220]   Adam and everybody laughs because oh he's attacking the troll and he's real right so Tallum thinks it's friggin me
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.020]   he's using my name and
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:44.820]   And I finally had it. I've loved this for two and a half years because oh, you know, I wonder after it was you
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.740]   Oh, J. I was a big funny day. No sense of humor. I lived with two and a few years
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:55.720]   I've guys had his fun enough enough. I might disagree a little bit. I understand. I understand how upset you are
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:02.020]   a troll someone else and that person believes it's me that affects my reputation
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.060]   I've had it
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:09.280]   But I mean the internet does require a little bit of if you go to his site his thing. He's wearing a
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:15.420]   And he's his go to a site his highlight a tweet is the sermon on the mount was the first TED talk
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.420]   It's a it's a jokey parody. So and this is
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.640]   Oh, Leo Leo Leo. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:26.780]   You just did more research than he should have to do in his Twitter feed comes this tweet
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:32.500]   That's what he sees the tweet is calling him horrible things and he responds to that tweet
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.940]   He should not be expected to have to do any further research than that. I hear you
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:42.660]   I understand that point, but on the other hand, I also understand why Twitter might say I mean parody is allowed
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.780]   Twitter is you expect Twitter to delete parody accounts? I
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:51.820]   Label them so that they're clear. I expect you not to be fooled on Google News
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:57.860]   The onion says satire Facebook is gonna do the same with those things so people are not confused
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.500]   Okay, fusion is not a good thing for a platform, but here's the bigger question
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.300]   So that's that's that's trivial compared to what what Robert Williams family went through yeah compared everything
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.300]   I was going on right now trivial as hell what it reveals to me though. So I'll make that clear
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.700]   I'm not comparing myself in this day anything like that and the guy says he's gonna change the name
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.220]   I just wonder when he is a hyperglocal think fluencer
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:24.900]   Clearly parody
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.060]   But Leo Leo, but you're giving him yeah
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.660]   You're giving him more attention than very much be that again requires that you that you go and go to the efforts
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:37.140]   Maybe just attack you what are you gonna do sit back and say let me find out who this no actually what I do is
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.140]   I immediately block immediately block them but
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.380]   What would this guy responded everybody and I do you know what actually women I take it back
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.300]   What somebody attacks me? I do go to their account
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:49.220]   I see how many followers they have how long they've been around whether they have a picture
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.980]   I look to see if it's I actually do do this
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:58.500]   I read previous tweets to see if they if this is a general pattern or if in fact I
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.500]   Don't think that's weird. I think that's called the internet. Welcome to the internet. We don't we say we got to teach
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.500]   Well critical thinking
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.620]   You're you're I think that that puts a to lowest standard
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.580]   But the but the now and now I'll go up in the altitude
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:17.580]   So and this will get to Mike's points zenah tufesky wrote it. We're a really wonderful piece at medium
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.380]   talking about the need for Twitter to be
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.780]   net neutral
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:29.980]   Because that is what allowed people from Ferguson for example to come on very important whatever they want as opposed to Facebook
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:35.100]   Where she saw no Ferguson because Facebook didn't make you interested in violence in a misery town
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.820]   And so a truly neutral platform
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:45.740]   But the bigger question me it is then does a truly new neutral platform have to be a breeding ground for trolls a-holes
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.700]   imposters
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:56.460]   sickos and so on and and that's the question that Twitter has to face right now because it affects Twitter's brand at some point all the stuff going on today about
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.740]   the assassin video and such so so so Twitter came along and and
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.860]   is killing accounts that that that have the horrid
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:10.700]   Foley video of the of the American journalist who is beheaded in Syria. However
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:15.500]   Because we will take down the picture of a deceased person with a family request
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:20.180]   however on the other hand Twitter had our pictures that did have newsworthy value of
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:24.500]   Mr. Brown's body lying on the street for hours in Ferguson, Missouri and
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.700]   And what a company like Twitter wants to do is to make an algorithm to say okay
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:34.340]   This is a rule set and then everything falls where that rule set that's it and they're in a very difficult position right now
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:40.060]   Because on the one hand their openness is a huge benefit to society and enables people to use it on the other hand
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:46.500]   It also brings in a lot of awful things and what is Twitter? What is its brand? What does it mean?
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.580]   That's what Mike was writing about and I think it's a really important discussion
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:57.700]   To look not just at Twitter then and not just at the cases of imposters or or certain videos
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.820]   We can look at the larger question of what do we expect of a tech platform?
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.260]   would it be enough if it said fake Jeff Jarvis or
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:09.100]   Parity account if Twitter said parity help yes. Yes as low as it was clear at plants
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:17.700]   But Twitter has an impersonation policy and they say that people are able to are allowed to you to create parity accounts
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.380]   And they differentiate between impersonation
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.700]   Which is against their terms of service and parity and on their parity account policy
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:29.620]   They list requirements the first is that the avatar shouldn't be a trademark or logo or picture the account subject
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:35.020]   So that check but the account name the name should not be the exact name of the account subject without some other distinguishing words
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:40.460]   Such as not fake or fan fake Steve jobs for instance right the bio should include a statement
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:44.580]   I am in fact a professor and my name is Jeff Jarvis is it Jeff H Jarvis?
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:51.380]   Yeah, there's an age to make a difference okay, and the bio should have this as a parody as a fan page
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.060]   I'd say Jeff
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.860]   I think that you have reason to report this this person like
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.940]   First nation policy I went to an executive at Twitter and I said when this episode happened
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:06.540]   And I said you know I've had it I've had it and they came back to me and they said well you have to fill out four
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:11.060]   And the form by the way says we're gonna chair this with the person and so then I sit back
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.300]   And I say okay, what's gonna happen is exactly what happened to me when I complained about it publicly
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.500]   I get tons of people saying oh you're just a you know stick of the mud asshole
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.980]   And so I end up worse off
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:28.460]   A number of parity or impersonating depending on your point of view accounts of our hosts
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.700]   Do we report them in every case right none of them have ever been taken down
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.420]   Some have
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.180]   It takes a long time yeah
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:46.780]   There's been one there's been one for me for years right, but we've never tried to take that okay
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:52.900]   Yeah, I don't really care everyone we try to take down which successfully okay, okay, so Twitter does respond they slow
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:29:01.820]   Yeah, but the problem is if I get something taken down that I'm gonna more blow back and the question the bigger question is what is Twitter's policy whether I reported or not
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:06.140]   What's their real policy on these things? What's their view so so the same with and again?
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:11.260]   I'm not comparing this little tiny trivial bullshit the S. Sorry with
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:17.300]   The far more serious things going on is this is why I want to get past this different from the right to be forgotten
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.780]   well, oh
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.300]   that's
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.300]   Well, I think impersonation
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.820]   Is is this an entirely different thing?
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.060]   I think the right to be forgotten right forgotten is more a case of if the
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.820]   Holy video was taken down by Twitter, which they've done again and again and again
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:39.940]   Now that's Twitter's right to do under its under its brand it can it can choose to
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.980]   distribute things or not but that's a huge I'm sorry go ahead
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:50.740]   By Twitter doing that you're right that does play to the right to be forgotten question is do we believe this is something people
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:56.860]   Should be able to see or not Matthew Ingram is out there today saying that this the Twitter is absolutely wrong to have taken it down
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.300]   I so the problem to me the problem is that
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.420]   Having Twitter itself go play whack a mole is
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:12.420]   Never going to work because for everything that they whack down they do the high visibility things the things that are in the news the prominent people
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:19.420]   But that's not the real problem real problem isn't your troll Jeff Jarvis and I'm sorry to say that because it is a problem for you
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:24.780]   But you're somebody who can argue anybody under the table and you have a lot of fans and people know who you are and a lot of people
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.500]   Can tell that you know when there's a parody account the real problem is that there are certain
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:34.620]   Okay, it has to be said that the vast majority of people don't have troll troubles right the vast majority of people use Twitter and
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:42.820]   Everything's fine, but there are certain people who are vulnerable to two trolls namely women transgender people who live in conservative societies
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:48.020]   young people people who are in crisis like like Robin Williams daughter and
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:53.220]   Celebrities famous people of any kind like you Jeff and so those are the kinds of people
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:59.380]   But those are the kinds of people have troll trouble and the real problem isn't a fake account like I see somebody and they
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:04.260]   They will mention me with the ad symbol on Twitter and I see it and I go to the site and I say oh
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.140]   They have three followers. I'm the only one seeing this and it's not a problem
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.700]   The real problem is when somebody goes and they want to be a public person. They don't want to hide
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:17.540]   That they want to have they want to become like Jeff. They want to become influential
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:23.980]   They want to become a public intellectual or public whatever they want to become and what's happening is that women and other people are leaving
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:30.000]   Social media all together and it's my point of my column is that it's not a social media problem
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.180]   It's a Twitter problem specifically and it's a structural problem and here's the problem
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.020]   I agree because we don't see this in other places to anywhere
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:42.500]   This is what I want to make other show exactly was this because really good point
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.180]   He's about and it's it's a it's a sudden the mechanics of it are are
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:51.500]   Feels subtle, but I'm just gonna say it very plainly on a site like Google+
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.300]   It's probably the best site for controlling trolls Facebook is pretty good too
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.980]   And you compare that against Twitter on Google+
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:06.300]   You control the conversation that results from your posts you can boot anybody out of that conversation
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.900]   You can block anybody lock them and they won't no longer see and when you block them
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.660]   They can never comment on any of your posts again on Twitter
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.900]   You don't control the conversation that results the conversation is out there. It's a difference
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:26.860]   Between having a cocktail party in your home with invited guests on the one hand and having a big screenfest and shouting match across the street
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:32.980]   And across the neighborhoods on the other in one the one case you can control it the other you can't remember when Google
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.620]   Forced YouTube users to use a Google+ login
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.460]   YouTube community was flipping out and I had a lot of arguments about how great, you know
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.860]   the the troll control was on Google+ and
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:48.380]   I had to make my point I went to the biggest troll I could find on YouTube and I said I
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.500]   Want all the trolls to come to my account and try to troll me on this message
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:59.340]   And and I can promise every single person reading this there will be no trolls on this message board not one and there isn't it's still
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.260]   There are 381 messages you just go through them and block the ones
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.380]   Yeah, nobody even dared because they know I'll just block them. What's the point?
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.100]   I mean and it's so easy to do and then when you block somebody you block them forever
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:14.820]   And that's a structural problem with Twitter and and so it's it's really my message to everybody out there who?
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:19.140]   Feels like you've been trolled to the I mean it can be horrible to be trolled
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:25.500]   Especially if you don't have the scar tissue that we have you know takes years to develop the that kind of
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.540]   Resistance to to this these kinds of attacks
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:34.820]   Don't leave social media just leave Twitter amen because Twitter doesn't have
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:38.660]   This is this is I think this was a really really good point and interestingly
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.700]   Jonathan Zonger who's the architect of Google+ came in and one of the discussions and said that that's
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:50.260]   Absolutely right and a key difference and I've urged him to come in and have to say more about this
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.340]   We've exchanged emails. We haven't had the discussion yet
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:57.580]   But here's question Mike is Twitter doomed by its very architecture
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:03.620]   To be the breeding ground of of trolls and postures bozos, etc
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:08.820]   I don't think so because again the vast majority of users aren't really affected
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:14.660]   They don't care that much Jeanette you agree with that with that proposition because when you've defended women who've been abused on on
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.300]   Twitter
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:22.020]   It's not about famous people. It's about people who maybe have one stock or one one whole person going after them
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.980]   It's not about fame in that case. It's about a platform for abuse, right?
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:33.380]   Yeah, I mean I was just I was just reading about just before the show started Zoe Quinn who's a game designer going through an ugly and bitter
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:38.980]   You know break up with a bitter ex-boyfriend who has you know brought the reddit masses after her
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.740]   They're dawking her they're posting personal photos and personal chats
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.580]   They're they're they're they all these guys are calling her
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:51.740]   you know slut and whore and worse and going to her co-workers and basically tarnishing her professional career, right?
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.420]   And this is somebody who I guess has has a little bit of fame within a sub-community
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:00.860]   But like we're all a little bit famous if we're you know if we speak up within our professional circle
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:06.340]   I mean you kind of have to define you know what famous means and there's a much lower bar now than there was
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:10.780]   And you know she you know it's affecting her professional life because she spoke out
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.780]   You know that she's outspoken on these these networks
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.860]   And I don't think that everybody is but yeah
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:21.260]   I mean this is the thing that annoyed me about Twitter's reaction is like when it's a celebrity complaining
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:27.420]   They immediately you know had a response, but it was regular people whose names weren't recognizable
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.300]   You know pounding that ask ask costalow
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.500]   Hashtag that day he did the CNN sit down after the quarter quarterly earnings report
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:41.500]   There was there was no response. I should say there was no response dick did sweet the next day that he was meeting with his you know
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.500]   his team of
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.540]   You know the folks who take care of these abuse complaints and you know and I get the whack-a-mole argument
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:53.740]   But you know what these companies spend so much time and put so much tech into preventing things like spam
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:36:01.020]   You know and I would just like to see that's that same sort of work and energy and thought go into dealing with abuse
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:05.700]   And you know this question about Twitter is similar to the question that we had about Reddit when
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.900]   violent acres was outed you know that the troll rate that the red the subreddit with the
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.340]   You know and reddit said oh we're just a platform
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.500]   You know you don't police would think of the zone and it's kind of the same the same argument
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:22.140]   Do I think so you asked is the platform doomed like as a consumer product?
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:28.580]   Probably not do no no I don't mean that is it is it is it doomed to have?
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:35.540]   bozos and a holes because of the structure because the architecture yeah because the architect and and and and
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:43.900]   Let's also acknowledge that in Zanebous piece. She argues that Twitter being open and and and giving the publisher
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:51.580]   Control is what allowed Ferguson to bubble up in trend where it couldn't on Facebook and probably couldn't on Google+ would be the arguments
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:56.580]   Well, so so is Twitter's openness which is an important important asset?
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.260]   do bit also be
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:04.100]   Sleezy and scummed up all the time. Let me ask this question
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:08.860]   I mean I think it's Twitter could build in better moderation tools and they haven't right but good good good
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:15.140]   Well, but I think that architecturally it's gonna be very difficult because it's so easy to create another account and leaving Twitter
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.700]   I understand what you am I misunderstanding you're saying?
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.220]   Well, just don't participate on Twitter you can still use Facebook and to Google+
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:26.780]   But it's still gonna happen on Twitter and if other people are reading it. It's like me blocking it on Twitter
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:31.500]   I don't see it, but it doesn't mean it goes away nothing nothing's perfect and just I want to quickly address
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.620]   Gina's point before I address yours. You can't moderate a conversation that isn't yours
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.900]   Right, that's the difference
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.580]   Whereas in Google+ you can moderate it because you own the conversation right
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.980]   To the post on tweets they're not right, but that's just not how Twitter works and never will be it
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:55.860]   But more to your point if you if you want to go from having a small number of people that you influence and that you engage with
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:04.380]   To a large number where do you do that if you do it on Google+ and you're active with the blocking and muting tools and flagging and all the
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:12.100]   Other tools that they have you will grow this big community that is that is very easily 100% troll free and the Twitter will forget about you
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:18.300]   For the most part I can't guarantee that of course people can take things to to Twitter, but they're not going to be
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:23.140]   So when you start a conversation and people are talking about that conversation
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.540]   You don't want trolls to be influencing those other people in that conversation
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:31.300]   That's the big problem whereas on Google+ if the conversation is on Google+
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:37.420]   You control that and they can't influence Jeff's problem would not have gone away
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.860]   I mean
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.500]   Jeff not being on Twitter would not make any difference
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.500]   No in his
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:47.060]   Well, it would have right because the the parody wouldn't be as funny if Jeff wasn't you know
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.580]   The parody is making is supposedly making fun of what Jeff does on Twitter
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.820]   If Jeff wasn't doing anything on Twitter if he didn't have that presence that'd be nothing to make fun of and somewhat
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.460]   I've done since in Sunday or since since Saturday. I all stopped tweeting
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.020]   Should we all just leave Twitter?
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:08.340]   No, and you kind of just well that's the thing. Oh my god. I got 140,000 followers on the other hand
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.060]   I think I used to write for TV guy there 25 million readers, but but
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:16.780]   But Jeff is not the solution. It's like saying, you know, I can't get a lot legally married in
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:21.540]   In the United States, so I should just move to Canada. I don't like paying for health insurance
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.940]   I think someplace and that's crazy that that's not the solution that doesn't mean that the problems
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:31.980]   You know our legitimate and it puts the it puts the onus to change on the person who's been victimized
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:39.300]   Right and that just gives the abusers and the trolls more power with that be a reason to lease would that be a reason to leave Saudi Arabia for example?
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.020]   My point my point is my point is
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:47.260]   My point is for a tiny number of people for whom trolls is a huge huge deal
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.100]   It is a reason to leave Twitter and I don't think anybody really needs to leave Twitter
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.640]   Just don't just start conversation on Twitter
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:57.860]   And let me ask Jeff Jeff has vastly more followers on Google+ than Twitter and yet
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:04.860]   Is there anything like the professor Jarvis trolling on Google+? I guess that there's not well, but wait a minute
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:09.180]   Google+ just changed their real names policy
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:13.600]   So could we not have exactly the same problem soon on on Google+
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.500]   But it's a tree falling in the forest on Google+ if some professor
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:23.860]   Draw fake professor draw me there lots of fake Mike Elkins on Google+ as well, and they just don't there's a non-factor
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:29.100]   They don't spoil anything. I think the key is there regardless of real names or not
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:33.920]   Which is that you control the conversation? So you can I think it is but there's a does mean you have to moderate
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:40.460]   Pretty actively. Yeah, and it's totally worth it and it's fine - aren't there trolls in blog comments? I mean
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.100]   Oh, yeah
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:49.820]   Google+ my Google+ conversations far are far better than any conversations. I have anywhere else, but you control the conversation
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:55.060]   We log even more but but it is coming in as easy. There's more trolling there
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:59.540]   It is architecturally different. I think I want to go back to Jean is question
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.380]   I think Jean is as always raising a really important point here
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:07.900]   So Gina I agree with you that and I said this about advertising this week when when
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:11.420]   Even Zuckerman wrote about this wants to give it a give up because it's ruined the net
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.420]   It was the original sin of the net. I
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.860]   Agree with you that the reflex should not be to just give up on things
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:22.380]   It should be to fix them what I'm asking is is it possible to fix Twitter is it possible?
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:27.700]   You know you've talked about some moderation tools that would help but basically what those tools do is just try to give less
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:33.140]   Attention to the people who are still there, which is Leo's point and those people are still getting attention
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.380]   I blocked probably a hundred people this week is I just said anybody who?
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:40.740]   Retweets or or praises this guy a block it
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:45.140]   I don't care who you are and I blocked somebody from the Wall Street Journal Europe and I don't care
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:51.060]   And I just I just blocked them all yeah, and it's pretty good. It makes your Twitter experience a lot better
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:57.460]   But your point is they're still doing what they're doing. Yeah, it's just you putting your own head in the sand
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:01.100]   I don't know I like Twitter a lot better after having blocked all that stuff
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.140]   I don't see it
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:07.540]   Isn't an impossible problem to solve like in an industry that prides itself on innovation and disruption
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.740]   It's so weird that folks are just so willing to be like oh, you know whackable never gonna win that game
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:18.420]   We can't fix this so I mean, you know, I think like the way the Google+ fixes it is that comments are subordinate to post
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.060]   So let's just let's just get crazy and consider Twitter
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.260]   So now when you view a tweet of mine that has a bunch of replies
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.820]   They all the replies show up on that same page, right?
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:34.660]   So it wouldn't be crazy for Twitter to say if if a tweet is in reply to another post
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:42.340]   Maybe we consider giving the per the original poster rights to delete or mute or you know
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.980]   Downvote or something that reply I know that this is very you know
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:52.420]   This is maybe some people would think that this is a you know a terrible change to the the basis of Twitter's architecture
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:58.260]   But someone could mention me and I wouldn't have any control over they can talk about me
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:03.060]   But if they're talking to me, maybe I have more control over what shows up on the page
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:08.260]   Which I you know of my tweet that's just one one example of saying that this is the solution
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.620]   I just think like that there are there are things that we can think of
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.020]   I mean Twitter is totally changing the timeline right now
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.420]   Because they're the worst advertising
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:21.300]   Advertisers and business value. It's just that they haven't prioritized this problem
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.660]   And that's and that's just that's interesting to me
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.060]   But I would take issue with that Gina because because
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.500]   What you're saying is there's no need to leave Twitter because they could fix this
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.020]   And what I would say is that they're not going to fix it unless you leave
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:38.260]   I mean, they're not going to go. It doesn't matter if they could fix it. They haven't fixed it
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.420]   I mean, there's no evidence that they're going to fix it. If we all bitch in Mona, I mean, eventually
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.220]   I mean dick Costalo is a benign person, right?
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.860]   Tilt they will fix it if we complain enough
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:52.500]   Well, I mean look, you know, I don't stick around anywhere that I think is a complete, you know, it's completely hopeless
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.380]   I mean my issue
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.860]   I just I don't think that telling will all respect to you my guy
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.940]   I don't think that the solution is moved to google plus
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:02.100]   I mean for me my friends just aren't aren't on google plus and it's a different experience
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.300]   It's a different tool
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.900]   It's just a completely different thing
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.420]   I have a solution for that at the end of the show and the tool my tool of the week, so
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.060]   I'll spoil it
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:15.940]   Move all your followers to google plus without their knowledge. You don't even have to it should be awesome
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:19.380]   What is a troll?
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.660]   All right, I love that question because when I've been writing about trolling this week
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.500]   And by the way, I have to say that the reason I wrote that column the reason I've been writing about
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:32.260]   Trolls is because of last week's this week in google got me thinking about it and and that sort of thing
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:36.420]   So that was a really great conversation last week, but a lot of people don't know what a troll is
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.220]   and and essentially
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.220]   People think that somebody who sort of
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:47.220]   Pastors somebody or you know is a troll which I don't believe it is or somebody who's won one troll
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:54.420]   Got I get in a big argument with them on google plus they were saying a troll is anybody who wants to be an influencer
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:45:00.500]   And that's absolutely not true to me and and let's see if you guys agree or disagree with this definition a troll
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.380]   Is somebody who either
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:08.020]   who deliberately creates emotions in the in the in the
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:13.700]   Mines of other people that in a conversation to either hijack the conversation and get attention on themselves
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:18.500]   Or to get a sort of sociopath kind of thrill out of upsetting and disrupting
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:25.300]   Constructive conversation. That's my definition of what a troll is and I think people use the the word troll
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:30.660]   Very broadly and unnecessarily. I think the trolling phenomenon is something very specific and very
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:38.580]   Mike I think that's good. I also I just put a link to a piece of wrote a medium and which I and leo my allowed to say out loud the
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.380]   spelled out a whole word. Yes
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:48.820]   Okay, so because it's a book title so an asshole's a theory which by the way I assigned in a curriculum for our new degree
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.220]   It was that was one of my favorite moments was to assign that book
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:55.940]   Key uh erin james defines
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:59.300]   that person right and any any uh
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.780]   uh
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:07.060]   He talks about the motive so then what I did was that I argued what the distinguishes a troll from a mere asshole
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:12.580]   And I believe it's that he and as I pointed out it's usually men one has a target
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:22.180]   Two seeks to get a response arise out of the target and three believes he is acting out of some ordained moral principle to destroy or to bring down his target
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:26.340]   Okay, that's my definition of a troll. I'm gonna read one from
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.820]   1999 from alt.troll
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.460]   This has been going on for so long
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:36.180]   Yeah in on usenet that they actually have alt.troll
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.100]   and uh
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.780]   This is this is a definition. What is trolling the use of the word trolling
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.820]   Comes from the fishing technique. We're a baited hook
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:48.580]   This actually might be useful to understanding this is drags through the water
[00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:53.620]   And it attempts to attract a catch a fish use net trolling is the act of posting an article or
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:58.660]   troll a use net news group with the intention of attracting the native and
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.860]   inhabitants and
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:04.500]   Provoking an emotional response there at which point they're caught as a fish would be caught
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:12.660]   The phrase was originally coined as trolling for flames. That's the historic origination the poster's intention was to incite a flame war
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.260]   Which I think is actually really more to the point it uh
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:23.140]   We don't we kind of want to impute an intent on a troll except that they get off in some way
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.900]   On the resulting carnage. They've made a difference
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.700]   And this and this by the way the kind of discussion we're having is exactly what a troll wants
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.260]   So here's the definition of troll from alt.troll
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:40.660]   It's convenient that the world troll has multiple meanings aside from the fishing example above trolls also the name obviously a mythical creature
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:46.340]   Uh generally thought of as ugly fat cantankerous work covered smelly and completely unlikable
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:51.620]   That's a troll since trolling is thought of as a detestable and unsavory activity performed by loathsome
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:56.100]   Contemptable hooligans. I think that's another good way. I like sociopaths
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.140]   Yeah, the name troll fits them quite well. They're two troll species
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.700]   Those with overactive minds
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.420]   Constantly seek out new sources of mental stimuli. I say they want negative attention
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:10.100]   I would even go further and say that there are some trolls who don't know that they're trolls
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.980]   Oh at acts many trolls do not know that
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:20.180]   And then there are those who are permanently disgruntled or physically short changed in some way and seek out ways to compensate for their shortcomings
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:24.980]   Through vicious personal attacks against others in order to achieve a mental erection
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.860]   I
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:31.700]   Think
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:40.260]   This is not new to the internet these kinds of flamores and trolling started with use that yeah
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:44.660]   Well, I remember uh, we talked about a study a couple months ago here
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:47.540]   And I put up the link on the rundown chat
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:54.020]   From february, right in which the most succinct definition of a troll you can philosophy find is a status
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.620]   Right. Mm-hmm. It came down to that that ultimately
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:04.740]   They were sadists they they which to to to wit they got pleasure out of causing others pain
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:09.380]   Yeah, and if you look at what happened to zelta williams, that's precisely what happened
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.140]   But the precisely what happened?
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:14.820]   It's somebody got pleasure out of knowing that they were causing
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:21.540]   Extreme pain their only interest in her was that she was vulnerable right to having pain inflicted upon her right?
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.340]   Yes
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:29.140]   It's a really you know interesting problem. I don't know what the answer is google plus
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:35.060]   Your answer to everything is google plus works for me it is
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:40.100]   And and it peaks on me, but but again, I think jeff is a perfect
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:44.660]   You know jeff is so prolific on twitter and yet where is the trolling on google plus?
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:48.340]   So jeff has these amazing conversations of google plus there's plenty of trolling on google plus
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.980]   Yeah, but it doesn't it's not a matter of it and delete it
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.540]   But the people who he's interacting with are not seeing that trolling that's the difference
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:59.460]   Mike saying another point is that is that there are platforms where you don't bother
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:04.420]   That was Mike's real point of time. You know, I have a different experience. I had a troll on google plus
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:10.900]   Uh deleted and blocked the person was able to make new accounts to repost to get others to repost
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:15.860]   It turns out even if you delete and block a post there the link is a permalink
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:20.020]   So he was able to recover that there there if you're persistent
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:24.420]   You probably can now whether they get any traction is another matter. I think you're right
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:30.420]   It's it's difficult to get traction on google plus if someone on google plus writes about you leo not replies
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:35.540]   But writes about you to the way that someone might i'll twitter might mention you you can't control that right?
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.540]   I mean so I mean we're back to the kind of the same
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:44.100]   I mean the the main difference between google plus and twitter and that's correct me if i'm wrong is that you can delete comments on your post
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:48.100]   That's that's what mike's talking about there are several there are four three or four differences
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:53.300]   So one of them is you can delete comments in which case they if they check they can see that the comment was deleted
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:58.180]   You can flag comments in which case the troll thinks that their message is still there, but nobody can see it
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:02.820]   Oh, I like that and they have and they and they have blocking and they have reporting and google
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.700]   tends to be more responsive to reporting
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:11.380]   Than twitter tends to be if you're not famous or a celebrity or if it's not something big in the news and here's another one
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:16.340]   That I never hear anybody talking about if I let's say for example that jeff javis is not
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:22.420]   Following me and I have a troll who's who's targeting me on twitter and I want to contact jeff
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.980]   But he's not following me so I sent a public twitter message
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:28.820]   That's the only way for me to reach jeff on twitter the trolls can see that i'm
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:34.420]   Interacting with jeff and then they can go after jeff pretend to be me do all kinds of trouble like that on google plus
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:39.700]   It's just happened today exactly happened today. I get five mike y'all controls coming after me this afternoon. Really?
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:46.260]   Yeah, me too on twitter. Yeah, I did and I blocked them all. Yeah, so so but on google plus
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:48.180]   I saw the same person. I just I'll point that out
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:55.940]   It's one person but on google plus you can contact anyone including a stranger in totally out of the the eye of of trolls
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:52:00.340]   You simply at mention them they get the private message and
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:06.580]   It's it's a great way to contact people. It's very unless of course they've set it up so that you can't be contacted
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:10.660]   So that's yet another way to do it. But the the sum total of all those
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:13.860]   things on google plus
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.860]   lens itself to
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:21.540]   You cultivating a community with zero trolling in that community in your community
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.340]   We are creating a society online
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:28.340]   And we have to decide and and and we're creating a couple things at once
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:36.260]   Code is law says larry lecig and the code of google of twitter is its law the code of google plus is its law
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:42.900]   We're also creating norms and my argument about the stuff is that every time you egg on a troll you are trolling you are an
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.580]   accessory to the crime
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:49.700]   You are just as bad you say fight fight you're just as bad it's been our experience that the best thing to do is just
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:56.100]   Go, you know give them nothing. I know but then in essence the rules have won the trolls agree
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:59.780]   Because because because well that's that's what everybody said is don't go out for this guy
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:03.860]   Don't do anything nor do they know in essence he then he keeps going and going and going
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.860]   And and you've created a strike stand effect here though, uh, jeff
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:12.020]   I understood that after them, but I think I finally just had it
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:15.460]   I think the norms argument can only be taken so far. I mean
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:19.940]   Uh, look at the lucy k routine where he talks about what a horrible person he is when he's driving
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:23.460]   Compared to when he's in an elevator the situation
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:29.700]   Will always always you know for you know, he's talking about how he's screaming like horrible things that people when he's driving
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:33.300]   But you know when you're standing right next to somebody you'd never do that. I think that we're
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:39.300]   Responsibilities. Yeah, we both have a responsibility and I don't think it's sufficient. I think that's so you're right, Mike
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:47.060]   Uh the the code creates an environment that that brings certain behaviors and discourages others
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.820]   But then we within that environment can choose to behave well or badly
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:57.620]   Yeah, and and so what i'm really asking here and what you know you guys are trying to answer and jeena is trying to answer here is
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:00.580]   Can we create a better society that we're building?
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:07.540]   And or or do we give up or do we just say well, you know, the trolls are going to be there and that's that and people are going to be abused
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.060]   That's that
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:16.420]   One thing we don't want for sure is internet community where there are no women participating because they can't participate safely
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:21.300]   And that would be a horrific effect. No vulnerable people. No vulnerable people of any kind
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:29.380]   Yeah, right and that's that's zaneps point about about fursen and twitter is the fact that it was open the fact that it couldn't be controlled by an algorithm
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.820]   Or the fact that it couldn't be controlled by other people is what let fursen
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:40.500]   Trend up to the point they've gone on media. So i'm fully recognizing the value of twitter being open and i it's a it's a question
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.900]   i'm not answering does that doom it
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:49.860]   To be is that is a social network is it doomed to be anti-social? Yeah, by by the way
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:54.100]   From the definitions we've heard here upwardly could be considered a troll
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:57.780]   Um most radio talk show hosts could be considered a troll
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.340]   Uh, I mean I
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:04.500]   I would disagree with this is link baiting a form of trolling. No, I don't think it is
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:09.060]   No, I don't think it is because the the idea is to disrupt somebody else's conversation
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:14.100]   Not start targeted and vicious if you want to start your own annoying conversation. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:20.180]   Right. It's it's disruption if if some if you set up an entire radio station that's all about screaming
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:26.500]   Political, you know, then you know, that's not you're not disrupting anything you're creating your own
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:34.260]   S pool, right? But if you go into somebody else's constructive conversation you wreck it deliberately. Yeah, that's yeah. Yeah, okay
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:38.900]   So form of vandalism exactly what it is for the same reason as for
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:45.060]   As for you know, the don't feed the trolls policy like in my experience of what i've seen and what i've experienced
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.540]   Do there are a few there are a few different types of trolling scenarios?
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:54.020]   One is the drive-by which is a one or two days one or two or three days of one person just talking crap at you
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:58.260]   That is straight up. Do not feed the trolls block me whatever walk away
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:03.540]   I've had the long term literally it's almost been almost nine years of that one person
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:07.620]   And i've done that like don't feed the trolls don't don't respond to him never mentioned him
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:13.940]   Don't but he keeps going and that's the one i don't have the solution for but then you have this this so equine situation where
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:20.740]   You have, you know a bitter ex-boyfriend, you know awakening that the mass the sleeping giants of reddit jerks
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:27.540]   Who are now doxing or the adriere richer situation or the catheseir situation where you just have this huge mass of people
[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:33.700]   Who are you know creating accounts and using the network effect to attack someone, you know in a concentrated way
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:39.060]   That that those are the situations where i wish that you know that that the victim
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:46.180]   Had better better tools for reporting, you know, i mean blocking one person here there once in a while is one thing
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.500]   Right, but when you have a situation like that
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:56.580]   It just it makes it can make a people person feel so helpless because they are because they don't have the tools and and twitter takes months and months to respond to it
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:00.500]   To report and someone else can't report somebody for you and all the things that we talked about
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:03.380]   And that's where i just feel like if twitter
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:08.980]   You know twitter needs to empower it's empower its users a little bit more i don't have the answers
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:14.020]   Uh, but i do think this is something that has to be that has to be addressed and look i love twitter
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:18.740]   I mean it's definitely my social network of choice. So yeah, i wanted to change and that's why i'm not just saying
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:23.940]   Oh, you know, it's pretty good to go to facebook or google plus because i just i just don't you know for whatever reason
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:29.700]   I just don't feel you know my people aren't there. I don't feel I enjoy you know, I enjoy the community built up on twitter for whatever reason
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.540]   Um, I mean if I thought that they really that there was no chance for change
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:37.780]   You know and that the platform was doomed. I guess I would leave I guess I just i'm just not there
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:43.780]   The other the other thing I observe is that people in the public eye have had to deal with this forever
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.980]   Going back to luie the 14th
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:54.100]   Yeah, we're mad at him because he married his mistress instead of just keeping the mistress separate. Yeah, and uh, poor aleck bald one
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:58.740]   What he's counting everybody who's in the public eye and and you kind of maybe even
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:02.980]   Know you're making that deal you may not know how bad it's going to be but you know you're making that
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:06.100]   The belief is that you deserve anything you get if you're a public
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:11.540]   So what's happened here is just that the public eye is much much broader than it ever was before
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:15.620]   So normal people are now subject to the same kind of public
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:23.140]   Invective and it actually strikes home. I mean if you're a nobody in nowhere and uh, nobody's going to write an article in the national acquire about you
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.540]   And even if they did it probably we're just kind of die
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:29.140]   An instant death, but we're all a little internet famous all of a sudden
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:34.500]   Mm-hmm. And it's but personally, you know, I could be at the park with my daughter and my phone could be blown up with horrible
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:39.620]   Just like it's you know, I could wake up first thing in the morning and that's literally the first thing that I read on my phone
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:44.580]   I get in the Alec Baldwin treatment. Yeah, exactly. We so I don't know what that means
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:51.220]   Uh, I don't want to make this this week in trolls. So, uh, but can we move on a little bit or you can all have one final thought?
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.460]   Why don't why we do that? That's why I was just kind of walking by
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:57.940]   I just want to hear one summary. So so Gina believes that things can get fixed to be better
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:06.340]   On twitter mike you kind of say move to google plus well. I don't say that actually I think that twitter is great for incoming information
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:12.020]   Uh, it's just not a great place for somebody who wants to build a community of people and have great conversations
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:15.860]   Conversations anyway because of the 140 character limitation
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:20.660]   But uh, if you want to do that twitter google plus is much better than twitter, but I would never give up twitter myself
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:22.740]   I mean, I like getting the incoming stream
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:25.140]   Yeah, I'm not I'm not gonna give up either
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:27.860]   but I I guess my one last question is
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:34.100]   Or or point is I I presume this is the case, but I hope they're having discussions just like this there
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:40.820]   And grappling with it because it does in the end it does I think this maybe a reason twitter isn't growing as fast as wall street wants it to grow
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:43.300]   Because people tell me we're scared of it. Yeah
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:46.020]   Yeah, where they're scared of
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:52.020]   Is the bad people it brings out and and twitter doesn't a fine way to deal with that while b
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:58.180]   Still being more open than either facebook or google plus to enable further sense of trend up
[00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:01.620]   That's the magic of twitter. It could be lost
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:08.420]   You know, it becomes a scary place of bozos. It could be long. You know, I bet wall street's actually more scared of is the thing that we most
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.460]   Value twitter for is is things like fergason
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:15.060]   Uh because that isn't not good for commercials
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:21.540]   And uh, really what wall where wall street would like twitter to go is somewhere that is a great place to put advertising
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:26.820]   And and I think I don't know if you did that on purpose, but I think that's the place to talk about the
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:32.580]   Tera six studio. Yeah, which is that do we want is that is the ban on these videos?
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:37.460]   Which by the way, there have been horrible videos on twitter for a long time, but now this is a famous case that involves an american
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:43.220]   Now it's a problem. We're talking about the american journalist who was recently like yesterday beheaded. Yes by isis
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:48.740]   Uh and they posted a video and that those videos have been circulating. I haven't I intention you know, I
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:56.500]   I've not looked at that video for obvious reasons. I don't want to see it, right? And yet it's a horrific story. Yeah, so twitter has been pulling
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:01.700]   Those videos down. No, they've been pulling down the accounts of people who posted the videos
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.780]   They've been suspending people's accounts
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:06.740]   If they posted the video see they're good at that
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:12.660]   This video was posted on youtube and youtube pulled it. So if somebody tweeted a link to the youtube video, right?
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.260]   This is what they're doing
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:18.580]   You couldn't see that even if you expanded the tweet and tried to play the video you couldn't because it's been pulled from
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.780]   It's on all the it's on all the video services is on
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:28.260]   It's on all of them. It's everywhere. Now after sharing a link to a new story about fully alleged killing
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:36.100]   Dic costalo announced this morning that any users who shared images of the supposed execution would have their feeds frozen
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:44.580]   Not deleted. We've been actively suspending accounts as we discover them. Yes related to this graphic imagery images of okay
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:47.220]   So it could be a still
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:51.140]   In fact people are posting stills as I uh, meanwhile in the uk
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:58.500]   The police the government said it is a crime to link to the video. They said it's an act of terrorism
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.140]   It is an act of a link to that is that is
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:07.140]   Matthew recommend going there's a lot of disagreement about that is a pure definition of censorship that is government
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.420]   Forbidding some of speech and I think that even that goes too far
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.500]   Mia pharaoh
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:18.660]   tweeted blackout on group that murdered james foley don't share video give them nothing respect james foley
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.740]   She has a point
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:26.100]   That's appropriate for her to do as a private citizen, but it's not for government agencies to do is that what you're saying?
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:31.140]   Right and twitter was also killing the ices accounts. There's an argument that says that well
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.940]   We should hear what they have to say so we can know how awful they are
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:39.300]   I'm not taking the stand about that necessarily. This is but this is these are tough decisions that twitter
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:45.860]   Twitter has to make and so it can't argue that oh we have to wait for somebody else to report something to us
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:49.140]   Twitter made the decision to take this down to your point jena
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:55.060]   Twitter made that and they didn't wait for people to um to report accounts there during on their own
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:58.580]   So where is twitter's line now is a legitimate question?
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:05.540]   Well, you know, I started getting afraid of this general area back when facebook was caught doing experiments on their users
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:09.460]   If you recall they would did a mood study to find out whether if people's
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:12.020]   Newsfeeds
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.900]   Were negative or positive if they would turn around and
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.620]   Themselves post things that are positive or negative
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.220]   Accordingly and they in fact found that it is contagious mood is contagious
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:26.180]   And I started thinking why are they testing that because they say that all their tests are all about improving this service
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:32.660]   So do they are they contemplating the idea of adding to their algorithm a positivity?
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:40.740]   Filter that weeds out bad news or negative comments by your friends and family by the way, it's just remember that because you'll be happier
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:42.180]   What's wrong with that?
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:47.460]   I am I the only one who who read brave new world? I mean, it's it's um, it's soma
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.780]   Is this is this where they're going?
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.260]   Is is the are we supposed as citizens?
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:04:00.580]   If if twitter and facebook is the new public square are we a citizen supposed to just shut up and enjoy our bread and circuses and not be worried about all that
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:08.260]   More cat negative things and just because it's bad for selling things and you know, or are they do they have responsibilities?
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:12.820]   I'm kind of present reality to a certain extent and also has to be said that there there's a value judgment here
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:16.820]   There are lots of cultures where for example sexual imagery is far more upsetting
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.460]   Than violence
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:23.860]   Uh violent imagery in fact if you even watch the spanish language news in the united states
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:29.140]   And you look at when they show a car accident they just show at all they just you know in they would never do that in the u.
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:31.140]   So there's a cultural difference between
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:36.740]   English speaking americans and spanish speaking americans about how much violence is acceptable in the evening news
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.660]   And so that's a value judgment that's being played there and it's an interesting question
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:44.580]   So are you are you asking whether twitter is just to push this too far?
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:48.980]   But that's what I do is twitter is motivation for taking on the video commercial you bet
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:51.620]   I'll say that is the question of course
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.940]   It is so by the way, this is this is a great lantic note
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:59.860]   Ethan zarkerman wrote this piece in the Atlantic about advertising being the webs original sin. I responded that that it wasn't
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:05.860]   Um, but lived up to the side in it. He told the anecdote that when he was a tripod as one of the early employees
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.420]   Ethan, Ethan
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:13.060]   They had a problem with advertisers not wanting to be in bed. So Ethan said i'm sorry. We had good motives
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:18.980]   But that's when he invented the pop-up because it was it was that way the ad was not actually on the site
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:24.580]   It's why it's why my space got let's let's be clear. This is why my space
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:33.220]   Got beat by facebook because advertisers were very reluctant to advertise in my space because they weren't sure exactly what environment their ads would pop up in
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:38.340]   And so let's also say that my space was for this is this is dana boy's point
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.980]   My space was more urban right facebook was far more wealthy and white
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:47.860]   And uh as a result people were disenfranchised for a while there because of them. Yeah
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.860]   I
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:54.900]   I mean if you're twitter you have a fiduciary risk you're publicly held company of fiduciary
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:06:01.940]   Responsibility to do what's best for the stockholders which is to cultivate a environment that advertisers want to be on
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:09.060]   And a little less cynical view is that twitter is a product and facebook is a product and the product designers at those companies are creating a
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:16.820]   User experience and they want that to be a good user experience right they want they want to be to be happy and be
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:22.100]   Everybody yeah, right right exactly and that's what brings in the advertising dollar
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:27.620]   And that is the slipperiest of slopes one on the other hand. I am perfectly happy not to see images of
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:36.020]   Beheadings in my twitter stream. Yeah. Yeah, well there there is a vast trove of things on twitter right now that are not banned
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:38.260]   Which you don't want to see
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.820]   Actually twitter is very free with uh porn
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:45.540]   Pictures and all sorts of stuff that you could not see on facebook you wouldn't see on instagram
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:48.980]   Um, but you also look at account like brown movers less
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:52.820]   Who's tracking this area and he put up pictures of corpses today
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:59.220]   Yeah, because he's documenting a war and haven't we criticized noos organizations for not showing the bodies in a war
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:05.060]   For sanitizing or footage right? I mean is it are the citizens of a country that?
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:07.860]   supports a military and sends
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:14.980]   People toward not supposed to know the reality is that I mean look at the effect of television on the vietnam war and how that essentially is
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:19.860]   attributed the the anti-war movement to a very large extent to the
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:24.260]   To the fact that we could see the realities of it much more clearly than we could in previous wars
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:29.700]   Are they should should they be mucking around with that sort of that sort of media?
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.060]   uh
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:36.340]   Citizenship, um, you know social movement kind of right which is the connection it was
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:41.300]   But now go to the other end of what we just had the conversation about so now we have
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:45.460]   You know, this is this is i'm gonna trivialize this badly, but i'm doing it for a point
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:51.860]   You know, ices is the ultimate of a troll right to ices is is is is trying to cause pain. That's their goal
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:57.540]   Yeah, and so when you put up ices's picture you serve their end
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:01.460]   When you put up the picture of the neighbor of mr. Brown in Ferguson
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:04.980]   You perhaps serve the Ferguson you know the brown family's ends
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.060]   And so trying to get context and motive in this discussion
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.340]   Only complicated more but is relevant
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:20.260]   That's i think a good distinction. Yeah, but but it's you can't you don't know who's end it is exactly, you know, it could be quite the opposite
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:25.860]   Here's the problem. I'm rereading technopoly right now by Neil postman and i disagree with
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:33.860]   Huge amounts of it, but it's of course beautifully written and and very provocative and he argues essentially that technology has no morals
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:40.340]   And replaces systems of morals. We i'm over-simile fine. Don't get mad at me postman scholars like j rosen
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:49.700]   But but it essence what you see in this case is is google's and twitter's and facebook's are trying to be reductive and reduce life to an algorithm
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:52.020]   algorithmic rule set
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:56.980]   So that they don't have to make individual judgments because any of those judgments are expensive and be they're tricky
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:00.500]   That's the main thing i'm coming away with is how hard this is to do
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:06.580]   I mean we're dealing with primitive machines that aren't anything like actual humans at huge scale. I mean, you know
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:14.660]   I like of course these systems are messed up because the technology isn't there because we try to you know make rules about how humans interact and those are
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:19.860]   Complex and fragile and differ across space and time which in the internet's everywhere. I mean there's a lot of different
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:24.180]   There's a lot of tough decisions here. So do you think that if mike brown's family asks
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:30.100]   twitter to not publish photos of him dead in the street that they wouldn't have done the same thing
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.980]   I don't know
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:39.700]   It's a new policy and and then if if they were taken down at the brown families request
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:44.260]   Or if brown family said we don't want you to put the video up in the store or whatever the case may be
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:48.900]   Then would there be other cases that say well, no, you're trying to sanitize the news in the world
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:53.380]   Same exact the video at the store now that's an interesting that's a different
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:57.220]   So because the beheading video you can argue that's like that's that violates twitter's turn
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:02.580]   You know like in terms of service around violent images, right? But the video at the store is not violent
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:07.700]   You know, so so that's kind of a different thing. Yeah, and to me like the video with the heading
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:14.340]   Is is a lot more violent than a still of a body? I realize that these are extremely subjective fuzzy lines
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.900]   um, but but it's
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:21.540]   I you know for what it's worth. I mean, I found the whole Ferguson thing has been so fascinating on twitter
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:24.180]   I found that if I had you know, if I had been gunned down hashtag
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:30.420]   Amazing, I saw media outlets changing the photos that they were using of brown as a result of that
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:34.020]   I mean it was it was really incredible. I just I didn't even turn on the tv at all
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:38.340]   I was just watching twitter and wag screens by the way, that's how it should be handled
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.340]   I feel very strongly that
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:46.340]   No organizations should censor in any way, but should give individuals the tools. Yes to self
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:51.460]   Sensor just protect themselves if it's a checkbox. It says I don't want to see beheading videos
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:55.700]   There should be a checkbox you can do that and that's much more effective
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:01.460]   You have control you just you just showed that control Gina by saying well, I'm not gonna watch the tv news
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:06.340]   I'm gonna watch that was and that's cheetah's point back to back to twitter and trying to give better controls to the
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:12.180]   Just need that give the users the tools don't try to do it for us. No, we don't need censorship
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:17.380]   We need tools. That's exactly right now when when the when the news of the existence of the video hit
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:20.580]   I did a breaking news thing on google plus and
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.620]   vast majority of people
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:28.420]   Talked about the news and talked about how horrible it was and there was a big conversation about Islam and all that kind of stuff
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:34.260]   But there was a minority of people who said I don't want to even know about this you're helping the terrorists by even posting this information
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:37.700]   I didn't put a video there or a graphic picture of any kind
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:41.620]   But the fact that I was reporting the news some people felt that I was
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:46.420]   Helping the terrorists and I was even blocked by a couple of people and that's how it should work
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.340]   Right anybody who's they get to choose
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:54.340]   That's right people should block me if they don't want to see the kinds of our posts where the platform has to intervene
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.620]   Hmm, I don't know who I disagree
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.140]   Which I disagree
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.820]   I think that's what tv does and needs to do because it's a single channel
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:07.700]   But that's what's so different about twitter and all of our digital technologies
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:11.540]   They can do that they can they can have the tools to do that
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:16.100]   Twitter has a rule about and austra accounts and says you could have them, but here's the rules
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:21.540]   That's an intervention by the platform an intervention in order to make it clear
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:26.260]   But they're not blocking those accounts. They're just saying you have to label it in such a way, right?
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.980]   If the account refused to change they'd block it
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:38.260]   You don't think that's inappropriate. I think that's saying you have to you have to do these things so that people then can make an appropriate judgment
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.700]   You want to empower the users ultimately you want to empower the users
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.060]   That's personal one. I agree with that principle one
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:47.940]   Yeah, origin
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.060]   No, no, go ahead. Jeff. That's how I was gonna say
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:51.060]   I mean, I think the helplessness issue is is war
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:55.140]   I mean that that's the kind of the worst part of it when you're when you're the victim of this this situation
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:58.500]   Not not only that there's you know, there's a threat or there's you know
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:03.140]   Something that that that makes you feel bad. It's the feeling that you can't do anything about it
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:07.380]   So empowerment is step one. So go ahead. Jeff. What's the next from there?
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:11.220]   So I agree first principle is that give their user more control
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.180]   Absolutely agree
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:16.100]   but then
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.100]   at some level
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.060]   the
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:21.540]   I guess we're trying to say the the brand
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:27.540]   Does intervene it does care about things. It's got to have a transparency about that and say what its rules are
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:33.620]   Right, so facebook will let you put up nude pictures. That means it won't let you put up pictures of women breastfeeding their baby
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:36.340]   I think that's where they that's a slippery slope, but that's where they get in trouble
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:40.580]   Exactly exactly but facebook decided that it wanted the forts commercial reasons
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.380]   You just said a minute ago. They have to have a fiduciary responsibility
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.820]   So they decided to breast-surveyed business, but then cutting out
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:47.620]   Since when?
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.540]   Inside the business. They're very wrong. I
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.540]   I well I
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:54.820]   Just try to make an illustration here. Yes
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:57.540]   And so
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:01.060]   But the problem there is that is that facebook tried to make an algorithm
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:07.940]   Bress equal no if I were a programmer I'd find a way a clever programming way to say that if breast then like
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:10.180]   Right, but that doesn't work
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:14.820]   Because you have to make human judgment you have to you have to come in and you do have to intervene in that case and say no
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:18.100]   No, no you fool owl who rhythm writer breast feedings fine
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:22.420]   Now I would also say breasts are fine, but put that aside because it doesn't roll with the human body
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:28.020]   But facebook made a decision and and that's their right to do and they said they don't want breasts
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:33.220]   I think a better way to do it is to enforce you do have to have rules what you enforce as a taxonomy rule
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:39.300]   That things are clearly labeled and they're not misrepresented that if it's a beheading video or a breast
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:45.780]   It's clear what it is and then the user's given the tools to filter and that's that's exactly how it should be
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:48.420]   This should be proper taxonomy that you can enforce
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:53.780]   But leo you're still a slippery slope you still a slippery slope because I remember I had a huge argument with with ed marquee
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:58.020]   Representative marky on a tv show many years ago when the v chip came in
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:05.540]   to cable boxes because the belief was of course violence on cable and sex on cable was going to corrupt all of our use because they're all a
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.540]   bunch of idiots and they're easily
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:12.180]   susceptible to this horrible influence by the way that's called the v chip has been implemented
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:18.980]   Do you know that it has been implemented and and it works really great. That's fine. I can change my cable settings so that kids don't see
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:27.140]   various things issue who decides what gets this carlit letter? Yeah, and that alone is
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:29.940]   a decision that can affect
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:32.820]   Again, it's an attempt to algorithmical
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:40.500]   Right. I think I think we're dismissing the idea that if you give enough control to users to block people or stop following people or whatever
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:46.180]   That's plenty. That's plenty people don't follow that many people on google plus for example the max is 5,000
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:47.540]   I know what it is on facebook twitter
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:51.620]   It's probably unlimited or it's dependent on how many people you're following or something like that
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:55.620]   But it's good enough as soon as somebody posts something offensive you
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:16:02.100]   Unfollow them or you block them or whatever and over time you end up with exactly the content you want to see I think
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:06.900]   Mike no no because what you're giving up there is the examples you gave
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:14.100]   And Gina gave of around you a thousand people are attacking you and yeah, you may not see them
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:19.620]   But you have this horrible life around you that actually you know somewhere out there is causing you misery and people are talking about
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:23.060]   But overtarns is bliss. Yeah
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:28.260]   There's there's somewhere between ignorance and is bliss and actually affecting things
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:32.660]   I mean basically if you create a cult a community within your social network, whatever it is
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:38.980]   Not just google plus and you thrive and live in that community and every time somebody does something like that you block them eventually
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:43.060]   They're just outside kind of fog in the window of your life of your of your
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:46.820]   I think in a lot of cases you're right, but there are cases where that is not true
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:53.380]   They can they can cause vulnerable people get attacked and attacked and attacked and just saying if they don't hear it
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:57.060]   It's okay to do this. That's not a good norm for our society right
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:59.380]   yeah
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:03.460]   And we should point out that all of these are privately held companies that could do any damn thing
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:07.860]   They please yeah, there's no first amendment right when it comes to privately held companies. So
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:09.860]   um
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:12.020]   It's twitter gets to do whatever it wants
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:14.740]   So but we can aren't we can I think reasonably argue that
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:22.580]   A good solution would be to censor less and and give users more power. Yes. I think that is the first principle and I think that works
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:26.020]   Yes, I think that's that but but there will be exceptions that yes that
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:31.060]   Responsible humans will probably have to deal with and that's my point of intervention. Yes. Okay good
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:35.380]   We've solved this. We're gonna take a break and come back with the properly formed
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:39.860]   Change log we got a run. We're almost at a time here in a trip any
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:42.820]   Shine up your change log shoes
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:44.820]   But first
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:46.100]   This is this is fun stuff
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:51.700]   And I I think one of the things about twig that is unique of all the shows we do is very philosophical and we get into these deep
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.100]   Dives and I hope this hasn't you know
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:58.340]   Turned you all off at home because I think these are important topics
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.260]   This has this has been a great conversation
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:05.940]   And and the reason why I'm glad we're talking about it is because I think the solution is for people like us commentators who have an audience
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:08.740]   Thanks to you Leo and thanks to twig is to raise these questions
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:12.100]   We don't necessarily have answers, but I'm just really glad that we're talking about it
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:17.780]   Uh because I think it's important easy. I also think that we have to acknowledge that this trolling thing
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:23.940]   Which started out on the usenet and so on and has been sort of a geek problem is now as a very recently
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.020]   A big public mainstream problem
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:31.060]   And so it's also that's another good reason why it's good that we're talking about this right now because this is now
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:35.780]   Totally mainstream like so many technology topics the New York Times wrote an article about it. It must be a big story. Yep
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:38.500]   Are you they're on it
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:42.420]   There are trolls on the internet and the New York Times is on it
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:47.300]   Are you sure today?
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:50.100]   That was that was a great time. That's a parody site
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.780]   You might if you were the New York Times be deeply hurt by that brutally
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:57.780]   Times will go days. They do cease and assist you if you use their logo
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:01.940]   They go after you in a flash even when it's an obvious parody, right?
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:04.980]   Parity is protected though by the law is that not right?
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:07.860]   Fair comment is protected
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:10.340]   Nobody's gonna ever sue weird al yankovic

[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:57.540]   If google detects that your flight is delayed or cancelled google now
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:02.420]   Will suggest alternate routes or flights from other airlines that will eventually get you where you need to go

[01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:59.620]   Yep
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:04.980]   Uh got some good news for spread sheet power users who love charts in google sheets
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:09.700]   Trendlines and you know that this tip is for you if you know what trendlines are
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:16.660]   Those are now available in scatter plot bar column and line graphs. This is in google sheets, which is their spreadsheet project
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:24.260]   Product and both exponential and linear trendlines you can see I think that's I believe that's a scattered chart in the screenshot there
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:27.700]   You can uh, you can automatically have a trendline show there
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.060]   And you can now copy and paste charts from one sheet
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:35.460]   Or one shed spreadsheet to another inside google sheets. So that's pretty cool
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:41.940]   Finally a new street view tour got added to google maps and this one is of iceland

[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:12.020]   Little shorter

[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.380]   We had kevin on triangulation a couple of weeks ago
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:16.260]   He kind of intimated that he wanted to get back to the designing projects
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:20.660]   I guess he's going to consult google ventures, but he's got a new texas startup called north
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:23.220]   It's all about moving to iceland
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:25.860]   I
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:28.340]   Don't know it's mobile. He's really into mobile apps

[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:39.860]   um
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:46.900]   But yeah, it just shows that sam song wants to have a product that will compete in the home automation space with google and apple
[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:48.900]   Because both are moving into that big time
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:52.900]   And they they were a kickstarter start they were yeah
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:59.060]   They were they were I mean that's another now to see that. Uh, there's a couple now. Yeah, uh, oculus rift
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:04.340]   rose money raised money on kickstarter then sold for billions to uh,
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:06.980]   Facebook and now 200 million

[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:21.620]   Cable companies there a little flip happened in the last month
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:24.420]   cable companies, uh
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:28.820]   Starting to make slightly more money on internet access than on cable tv
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:32.580]   Oh, that's that's a mild stone. That's a shift
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:36.340]   That's a shift to peter kafka writing for recode
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:41.860]   The cable guys have become the internet guys. This is a from liketman research group
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:50.660]   49,915,000 internet subscribers compared to 49,910,000 tv subscribers
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.580]   I don't know what that means. I don't think they want to be the internet guys
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:56.260]   I think they like to being the tv guys
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:58.820]   They loved it because there's a lot of money a lot of free money in there
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:01.300]   And I remember talking 10 years ago to cable vision
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:06.420]   Which was of all the internet all the cable companies the most forward thinking they're in long island in New York
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:11.300]   And they said our financial model does not work selling, uh wholesale bits
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:15.940]   Yeah, we got to sell the premium retail bits. Yep, but I think they want to see them trying to go against it
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:18.740]   Then neutrality, but but you know they seem the margin on the wall
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:23.300]   Yeah, the margins in the cable business are in the internet access business are phenomenal
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:28.740]   Well, and if you look in those intervening 10 years what the cable companies did is they raised the cost of internet
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:33.780]   Uh considerably so that people were paying as much for their internet as they were off their tv
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:35.940]   Oh good now. We're okay now. We're happy
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:40.260]   We're the turns out we can't we don't lose money on the internet anymore
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:44.660]   You know, it's a really interesting story that came out this week is that google's coming out with
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:47.460]   a under 13 year old
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:54.500]   Uh sign up, which is so that's parental controls. Yeah parental controls and so on so the the just to summarize the story
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:56.980]   the good news is that
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:59.860]   Google will enable parental controls and have
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:06.260]   a version of uh youtube and gmail and probably some other properties that don't collect data
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:12.100]   They don't collect private data, which is against a law in any event and they'll hopefully be converting people who are
[01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:17.140]   Under the age of 13 who are using these services by lying about their age
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.980]   Right and which is so that's the yeah, that's the right fun facebook
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:22.980]   I don't know if it happens on google plots, but it would
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:27.220]   I probably happens every it does happen on google plus i've seen a kid show up my stream
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:29.700]   I always sort of block them and delete them and stuff like that
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:34.500]   But it's and then the downside of course is that they're targeting kids
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:40.260]   They would be targeting children for a kind of ronald mcdonald's style marketing of kids
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:43.780]   So that they they sort of develop their brand preferences for youtube
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:45.620]   Kids
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:49.460]   You will be a google plus right i don't know that they're going to come out with their own clown
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:53.380]   But um, they that would be great plus see the clown that's right
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:57.300]   I'd work for google
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:00.740]   You can do balloon animals in the shape of a g listen
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:05.380]   Got the hair
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:11.940]   So that's plus see the clown so is this is this a benefit to mankind or is this a terrible thing?
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:15.380]   What do we think?
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:18.020]   I think it's a good thing and
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:24.820]   Who was it who also thought who wrote a piece that put in the rundown up top? I mean you gotta recognize that kids are doing it anyway
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:27.700]   Yeah, exactly. It's never it's not illegal for that
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:32.660]   It's just that parents have to approve it most companies don't want to go through the problem of proving that the parent is approved
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:36.020]   But will the kids who are currently doing it by lying about their age saying finally?
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:42.100]   I can now have a parental controlled version and no so no but parent but I think larry maggot
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:50.660]   Who writes ad forms and works for me at cbs station does a lot of things about kids and and he argues today that it's a good thing that
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:56.100]   Millions lie anyway. We need free speech. He's he's saying that
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:58.580]   Well actually he's saying they should admit
[01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:02.340]   So we're under 13 anyway. I think no very few kids under 13
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:07.300]   Plus they all want to use facebook, but the youtube is the big one so so yeah
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:10.420]   That's right so they had to do it so that they could comment on youtube
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:15.780]   There's some pretty horrible stuff on youtube and so that you know a kid-friendly version of youtube would be would be nice
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:21.700]   There were rumors that the youtube was looking at that. Yeah, yes, right and including special programming
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:23.860]   You also have the story on tnt
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:27.460]   That google there is a new google slash youtube music
[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:32.500]   Effort if that hasn't launched yet what a show of tnt is that all this news just incredible
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.740]   You would not ever
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:39.780]   10am pacific you'd never be out of the loop. That's right. That's right. That's right for people want to be in the loop
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:46.100]   That's right. So yeah, they're looking at a music service and it's weird because the 999 that you would pay
[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:52.740]   Would get you both the youtube music service and also google play music. Yes, you already play pay for play. Yeah
[01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.980]   So i'm just gonna get youtube. Yeah
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:32:00.100]   Anyway, yeah, but you get this new well you get a you get an offline mode you get an audio
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.940]   Only mode you get other benefits like that
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:07.700]   But you also have lots of content and music from concerts and stuff that would never showed up in an album or you know
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:12.820]   This extra music for super super fans. It sounds pretty good, but I don't think they're gonna change the world with this thing
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:14.820]   It's not out yet, right? No
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:20.260]   It's not they haven't even announced I can't stop watching the Taylor Swift video over and over and over
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:23.060]   Shake it up
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:23.940]   I
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:26.980]   You see it jina. I can tell by your lap. I actually
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:30.260]   I saw it
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:33.620]   And I saw that I am aware of it, but I have not watched it yet
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:36.180]   I saw that I saw the animated just of it
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:38.980]   The animated no
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:42.820]   That's for you to this you define me to know and you to find out
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:45.460]   said mother
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:51.460]   It'll be called youtube music music key. I like the name key. It's like the key
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:54.580]   to your music
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:55.780]   um
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.780]   in fact all
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:01.380]   Stuff all the google play stuff will be renamed key or no just a music no no
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:09.700]   So far of what we believe we know from somebody's anonymous sources is that music key is one service google plays music will
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:16.340]   Continue as it is. Oh, okay. The monthly subscription of nine and I'll get you both got it, which is you know again. That's weird
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:25.300]   What did you think about this jeff javis time magazine rating its writers not only for the quality of writing the impact of stories their newsworthiness
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:31.780]   But also that how well they produce content that's beneficial to the advertiser relationship
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:39.060]   You know, I keep rooting for these big old companies to survive somehow, but they keep shooting themselves in the foot. Oh horrific
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:42.580]   I showed this to lisa. She said that's a good idea
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:46.580]   No
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:51.380]   At least but it's very you know she does sales right it's very tempting for the sales departments to say
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:56.020]   Hey mike if you could just tone down that story a little bit about smart things. We'd appreciate it
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:57.780]   I've had I know places
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:02.340]   We don't I don't places that have taken the traffic of a given writer and tried to calculate the the
[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:05.460]   CPW the cost per writer
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:07.300]   Well, that's normal
[01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:12.980]   Devorek tells that all that's not the story all the time about how they would measure, you know, which column you were an editor
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:20.340]   And you know about what it was a windows windows windows magazine and other publications and i've had the conversation where the the basically the
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:24.820]   What happens is the publisher what the publisher usually is eventual
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:30.420]   You know all publishing publishing companies like tech startups. They have an visionary founder who's usually editorial
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:36.020]   Right and then what happens is eventually a sales person rises in the ranks to become the publisher
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:40.340]   So the publisher is like a super salesman even though they're in charge of sales editorial circulation and so on
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:43.140]   And so you always have that conversation. Can you not do that?
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:48.340]   Can you like you know, can you and it's almost always about the headline because because publishers don't read they don't read
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:50.500]   They see the headline doesn't sound like
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:55.780]   The sound on so it's all about your hair. So it's a constant. It's a constant battle in publishing
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:59.380]   And I take it back. I I really maligned Lisa. She did not
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:01.780]   Save it
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:03.780]   All right, I I'm we
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:05.380]   The correction the correction is noted
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:08.500]   Unburied there that was unfair to Lisa
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:11.620]   She understand actually that's one of the things that we've done
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:18.100]   I think really well here is we've really made that clear to everybody that you know, you you tell the story
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:22.100]   That's what's important and we make it clear to advertisers too. You're not going to get favored treatment and I think
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:28.100]   It's nice to be in a medium where you're a little bit more in control of this
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:33.620]   Yeah, right where you do where you advertisers have the expected understand that and from upfront
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:37.860]   Yeah, look you're not gonna get special treatment. You're buying an ad. Yeah, exactly
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:42.420]   But I can understand how that gets to be a slippery slope. Yeah, when I was the tv-critical people
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:47.380]   I called hallmark hall of fame again and again and again the horrid treacle that it was
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:50.260]   And
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:53.460]   They pulled all their advertising people magazine a lot of money
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:57.780]   Well, de Voir tells a story. I think it was de Voir. It might have been Bill McRone
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:03.060]   Microsoft at one point pulled all its advertising for pc magazine for one app one week
[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:10.740]   Yeah, and then said whoops, and they put it right back. Yeah, right. It's nice to be in a position where you have to advertise right? That's right
[01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:16.980]   I think we are done
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:23.380]   I can't see anything else really important. We can nothing we can't say for next week. It's a great conversation
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:25.700]   This is a good show so much
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:30.260]   Mike Mike, I'm so glad you were able to join us because I don't know you work there
[01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:36.420]   Thank you for dragging me and I walked I walked all the way over from right over there. It was so good
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:39.460]   We are so thrilled that Mike joined the team and
[01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:42.100]   TNT has become
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:45.700]   I think what our tent really was the journal of record for tech news. Yeah
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:49.620]   Well, you go there. You know, you're you know, you're seeing you're gonna see Peter Kafka
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:53.380]   You're gonna see all the people who are writing these stories come and talk about what they what they know
[01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:58.900]   It's really really fun to get all these great journalists in and have them talk about the stories they wrote. So I really like it
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:04.820]   Uh, let's because you're our guest. Let's let you kick things off with you're a tool of the week
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:10.500]   I'm gonna make us all want to move from twitter. I consider twitter to be a feature of google plus
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:13.780]   That's how I like that. That's how I use it. I don't think it's a separate service
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:20.660]   And what I do is I have I have a tweet a twitter bot tweet tweet bot. What's it called? My the desktop
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:24.980]   Third party version of that shows me twitter. Yeah
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:31.300]   Tapbox and it's great because it just streams in with no intervention on my part and I can see breaking news and all kinds of things
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:38.500]   And when professor Jarvis post something I get it right away. No, I'm just kidding. I'm I'm this is I'm using it right now
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:40.740]   So I show this there's tweet but on the man
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:47.700]   That's an input and I have several streams and so on and when I post I use the service and this is the tool of the week called friends plus me
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:52.740]   So if you go to friends plus the word plus dot me you can download this free tool
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:58.100]   And what it does it automatically posts your google plus posts on twitter and other sites now
[01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:04.580]   There's a controversial point people say don't never never do that. Yeah, I used to do that with twitter to facebook and I saw yeah
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:06.740]   Yeah, and it often doesn't work
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:11.380]   And I personally don't think it works from google plus to facebook because my family doesn't want to see
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:15.780]   Right all the stuff that I post on google plus and that's mowlin mainly who i'm concerned about on facebook
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:21.540]   But for twitter it's perfect because what happens is it takes the first line of whatever your google plus post is
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:25.860]   It posts that as the tweet on twitter and puts a simple link back to google plus
[01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:31.220]   We can have a civilized conversation that you control about that topic and it works fantastic
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:35.540]   It looks beautiful the tweet is indistinguishable from an ordinary tweet
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:43.060]   But the beautiful thing is you get all your google plus community and all your twitter community together in one conversation talking to each other
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:46.980]   And it's a troll free thing that happens on google plus rather than on twitter
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:52.980]   Yes, people can go off and talk about on twitter and they do but for the most part it brings a huge critical mass back to google plus
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:55.140]   Now they also support
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:56.820]   LinkedIn
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:58.340]   tumblr
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:01.540]   app dot net if anybody's using app dot net and
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:06.820]   You know private blogs so a single tweet can go out to all of those you can schedule them
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:12.100]   You can say okay when I post something on google google plus posted on twitter on hour after you posted on google plus
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:14.500]   You can do all kinds of flexible things like that and again
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:17.940]   The it's a it's a freemium service
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:21.220]   So you you know the the basic service is free and you can do just about everything
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:24.100]   I just described with a free version and then you can upgrade
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:28.180]   For team support and things like that, but I recommend that everybody at least try it again
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:30.500]   It's free and just try to see how it
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:33.540]   What it does for your twitter feed it's essentially
[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:40.980]   Dragoon's twitter into your google plus orbit and that's a great way to use twitter. I think i'm signing up right now for zero dollars
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:46.740]   Up to five accounts free right well that's zero. That's everything. I just want to use it for yourself
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:49.940]   Yeah, very cool jina trapani your tool
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:53.700]   My tool my tip this week is actually kind of a late addition

[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:35.780]   Uh, most talk we talked about it last week was the 10 year anniversary of the google ipo
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:43.700]   But today we have 10 there's only 10 that's 10 more than 10 or the google ipo. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:45.700]   Kind of long
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.220]   Yeah, yeah
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:51.620]   And if you invested ten thousand dollars at the time i think you'd have a hundred three thousand dollars
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:58.980]   And but there are still there are 10 stocks that have done better only 10 but 10 have gotten better and you actually know some of them
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:01.780]   Uh greek kore green mountain
[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:08.580]   What oh there those are the choffee pods. Yeah, the courage beverage. Yeah, i'm on spice line apple

[01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:23.540]   Yeah
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:27.620]   My a tool i just got i this is looks like a lot of fun. It's a game. It's a board game
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:32.740]   I got it on amazon called query the game a board game where fun is auto completed
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:40.260]   Yes, isn't this a great idea? This is very appropriate to the show
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:44.260]   You guys i want you to play it on all about it or maybe we'll play it next week query the game
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:47.460]   Uh the the idea is you've got a query master
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:53.620]   And in each round you have to you get little pens and you and you have to write a query ending
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:56.580]   It's kind of like family feud with autocomplete
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:03.220]   Does that make sense? You're going to predict what the auto complete are okay, so here's a here's a card
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:07.300]   So
[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:11.780]   Uh, I guess the question is why do you type this into your autocomplete?
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:15.860]   Don't do it at home. Why do b a r and then you you see you were saying?
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:22.500]   What would that what would be the completion of why do b a r? Why do baristas always have beards there you go
[01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:29.460]   Why do why do barthlin sis reoccur? Why do barristers wear wigs? We did that on
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:34.180]   Twitter on sunday why do bars close at 2 a.m?
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:41.140]   Why do barbershops close on monday you want to do all changed don't they i don't get it. Is this changes?
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:47.380]   Yeah, so it's a game said so there's a upgrade model there so you have to buy it every year by the new query
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:51.060]   How can I make sure?
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:54.180]   Oh boy
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:57.300]   That i'm not pregnant

[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:12.980]   Jow

[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:28.420]   Pretty much they're all related. How can I make sure I neither have a girl nor a boy?
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:30.900]   This was uh, what is it 30 bucks? I can't remember
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:34.180]   It started it was a kickstarter. It is now out as a game
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:36.660]   You get little aquari pieces
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:43.620]   And uh, and the query game and the master scoring sheet so you have the query master and then you can uh
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:49.860]   Oh, so you at no point you used your computer in this game. It's at no point are you allowed to use your computer?
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:52.500]   Oh, you have to guess
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:54.580]   That's impossible. I'll just wear my glass

[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:01.380]   I think we should do it like they do world poker tours. You have a little pocket cam
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:04.100]   And you can you hold up your assignment
[01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:08.340]   And then so the people at home have to know right what you are
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:10.980]   Yeah, they will from just watching the games
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:16.420]   From the night time right that's right. Do we want to cut out at night or do we want the viewers to know and then
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:18.420]   Yours should know everything
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:20.500]   All right. Well now all right. I'll talk to you
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:27.140]   We'll get Harper and some others to play with us
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:29.940]   All right, all right
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:32.820]   One condition one condition. What's that gg
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:35.620]   Algens kind of make pizza and is pretty common
[01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:40.100]   Well, what we're trying to do is we're having each host do something that's completely out of character
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:43.620]   Some secret hobby or or passion, right?
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:49.220]   So last year we had Alex Lindsay show us how to do mixed drinks. We had Mary Jo Foley show us how to do a beer tasting
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:53.700]   Steve Gibson make coffee. So whatever your passion is I think wear wolf for Gina for sure
[01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:57.060]   Yeah, well, this I was kind of stuck on that like oh, what's my
[01:48:57.060 --> 01:49:05.540]   Maybe I think it just figured it out. What's my secret passion too? I love work and they're not telling me a lot of the things
[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:07.380]   We're doing it's all gonna be a surprise for me
