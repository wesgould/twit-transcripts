[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.720]   I thought I was ready for the Snowconeverse.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.720]   I had lots of opinions about that.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720]   Did I not say the Snowconeverse?
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.720]   Well I know and I have opinions to share about the Snowcone.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.720]   That's why I mentioned it.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.720]   We have Snowcone News and Fed-a-News today.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.720]   Both.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.720]   Katya Peppi made with Veda Cheese.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.720]   Ritro-adleos intros.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.720]   Stacey on IOT.com is the website.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.720]   Hello Stacey.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.720]   Oh hello.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.720]   Hello.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.720]   I love your Pajmina.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.720]   You have the best shawls and stuff.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.720]   That's beautiful.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   It's because I'm an old shawl lady now.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.720]   Because I live in a cold climate.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.720]   My mom, who's 88 and really is an old lady.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.720]   And by the way, mom's getting the vaccine on Friday.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   I'm very excited.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   Yay!
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.720]   She's thrilled.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   She's in Rhode Island.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   Are you getting yours sometime soon, old guy?
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.720]   I'm encouraged because apparently we just bought 600 million doses.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.720]   So I feel like, you know, I'll be getting, I'm in group three in California.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   We're in group two right now.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720]   That's all right.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.720]   I feel like in next month or two, yeah.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   That's fine.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.720]   I get dose two on Tuesday.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   Good man.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   I'm so excited.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   Yay!
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.720]   See what I mean?
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720]   There's a light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   There's something happening.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   There's a future.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.720]   We can't get through these intros, but you know, good things are happening.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   My mom, the reason I brought her up is she's well beyond shawls.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   She's now wearing mob caps.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.720]   She calls them mob caps.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   I think this is what they were called in the Revolutionary War.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   They're hats on your head.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   Like a toke?
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.720]   No, they're tighter than that.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.720]   They're, I don't know, they hold your hair and they keep your head warm.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.720]   Anyway, she, they're like, if you Google it, around gathered and depleted cloth bonnet.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.720]   Interesting.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.720]   They're kind of more revolutionary war.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   Oh my.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.720]   She's all into the mob.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.720]   She's all into the mob caps and she's sending me some.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   So, I will be wearing a mob cap.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.720]   Hey, John, I'm not getting the stream is you got to put the stream in the monitors.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.720]   So, because I can't tell what you're taking a picture of, but I gather from the laughter.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   You're, you're seeing this simple American bonnet and portrait by Benjamin Greenleaf 1805, which is, ironically, the, the, the house I grew up in was built.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.720]   So, maybe that's where she got the mob caps.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.720]   Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.720]   Let me get the script.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   Oh, the Leonard town professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.720]   Our graduate school of journalism city.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.720]   University of New York.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.720]   Thank you.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.720]   Hello.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.720]   Hello.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.720]   Hello.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   Vaccine two on its way.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720]   That's good news.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.720]   That's I really.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.720]   So I got a, I got a two week delayed reaction to vaccine one.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.720]   So yeah, you last Monday.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.720]   I got a two week reaction.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.720]   Right.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.720]   I, I saw it was 13 days afterward afterward.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   I suddenly got a fever and a aches and headache and all that.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   And, and, and I thought, oh, I got it.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   So I went in to get a test and it was negative.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   I just think it was a delayed reaction.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.720]   My arm got sore two weeks later.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   Randall Monroe explains this in his XKCD webcomic from a few days ago.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   If you could actually show this.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.720]   The vaccine, it's an explanation.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   Contains mRNA instructions for making the virus spike protein.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.720]   Weird.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   So the vaccine's just blueprints.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   Your body reads the mRNA makes the proteins and has an immune reaction to them.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   Why would my body attack something it made itself?
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   Well, and so here's a little story.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   Here are the death star plans.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   Thank you, princess.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.720]   These blueprints are from Princess Leia.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   She's always giving us projects.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.720]   Here, take these blueprints to your construction crew.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.720]   Affirmative.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   What is it?
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   No idea.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.720]   Something.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   The princess wants.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   Copy that.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   Soon.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   Hi, Commander.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   Construction crew B here.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.720]   We finished building the princess's big metal orb thing.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.720]   Do you know if she wants us to park it somewhere or ahh, ahh, ahh.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   Is everything okay?
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   Ahh.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   Imperial Station.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   Battle.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720]   Battle.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.720]   Red alert.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.720]   Get the fighters in the air.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   Kill it.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.720]   Kill it.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   Get it.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   Keep firing.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   Can everybody please chill?
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   We don't even have that laser thing wired up.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   Hey, boom.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   I said we, we kick it through.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   We're running out of proton torpedoes.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   Send every crew to build more torpedoes.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   There aren't enough ships to build more ships.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   The thing is just sitting there.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   Are you sure we keep building ships?
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.720]   Build ships forever.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   Destroy the orb.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   What is wrong with you people says the orb?
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   Definitely feeling a little sore.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.720]   Yeah, they said you might have some side effects.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720]   You lie down.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   I'll get you some hot tea and a blanket.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   Meanwhile.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.720]   They're trying to kill the Death Star thing.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.720]   I hate you all so much says the guy in the Death Star.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.720]   What's that?
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.720]   It looks like a thermal exhaust port.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.720]   I'm going in.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.720]   Pew pew pew.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   And it blows up.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   The poor folks in audio this made no effing sense.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   You can read it on XKCD.com.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.720]   I'm not done.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.720]   I'm not done.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.720]   I'm a little upset.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.720]   I'm not done.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   Don't interrupt.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.720]   Hold on.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.720]   Okay.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.720]   This is for you Jeff.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   Okay.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.720]   Now.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   Okay.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:39.720]   So it was the yeah well you'll understand once we so now back to lay as she says good work even though you know they're a little frazzled and the patient back here on earth.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   I'm feeling better today.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   That's great.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   A few months later.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.720]   Cough, Cough.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.720]   We have reached the rebel system Lord Vader.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.720]   Now they shall witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational thermal exhaust port.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:00.720]   And then they blow it up immediately and that's the idea of an MRA vaccine children.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.720]   All of which we want to thank this moment.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.720]   Dr. Kizmikaya Corbett.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.720]   Yes.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   She.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.720]   Kizzy PhD.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.720]   She pushed.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:17.720]   She in a weekend worked on what is the vaccine that went into my arm and when Biden met her he said a weekend she said yeah weekend.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   And now was she the one who was originally.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.720]   Was she the one talking about MRA vaccines 20 years ago and got funding with her a little too young for that.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.720]   Okay.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.720]   So that was the that was the woman by out by a Gary and woman.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.720]   Yeah researcher working at a university who you know came up with the idea.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:43.720]   But see the thing about Kizzy is interesting is and they did this back what a year ago right in April or something in March.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.720]   Yep.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.720]   They were able to sequence it very very quickly.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.720]   Literally weekend.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.720]   So Kizzy PhD is her account.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.720]   She's just she's my hero.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   I mean she's literally my hero.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.720]   She it's because of her work.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.720]   That's how we got the vaccine.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   And she's really something.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   So she.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:07.720]   We would have had the vaccine sooner but after they invented it.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.720]   They had to test it for like nine months.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   Oh, he's not.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.720]   We.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   I was like we're not going to actually argue against that.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.720]   You do have to.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720]   No, that's a good idea.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   No, that's a good thing.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.

[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.

[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:41.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   Well, we saved the problem here of paying for links.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   We're not paying for links.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.720]   We're paying for news and they're shutting up about the political stuff and that's that.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   Still, I think it's a terrible precedent because it was blackmail.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   It was bribery, pure and simple.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   Google just said, "We don't really care.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   Nobody's going to read this news.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.720]   We got the showcase who cares.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.720]   But fine.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.720]   Here's a bucket of backsheesh money.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.720]   Here, will you shut up now?
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.720]   Here's a little more.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.720]   Will you shut up now?
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.720]   Okay, now you'll shut up."
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.720]   It sets a precedent around the structure of the web still.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.720]   It means that media blackmail works.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:45.720]   Journalists and media use their political capital with politicians without ever acknowledging
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   the conflict of interest here.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   Google did not, to my mind, sufficiently defend the internet.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.720]   It finally just said, "I had a hack with it and did this."
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.600]   The money I don't think is going to go to journalism.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.680]   It's going to go to Murdoch's pocket or it's going to hedge funds pockets.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.920]   I was upset and angry.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.920]   That was most of the day.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.320]   Twitter going crazy about this is I'm pontificating about this and where it's going to hit next
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.360]   in Canada and Europe and so on.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.760]   Then Facebook, I announced this out.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.600]   Before you go to Facebook, let's finish this story because I know you have the final word
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.720]   but I just like to interpose a little bit of a word in between.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.720]   Please, because Stacey made...
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.720]   We do.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   We do.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   We do.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   We stretch things out.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   I'm not sure.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   We may be able to recap that but you should have a opinion about this.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.720]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.720]   I don't need to be hamburger help.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   I was joking.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720]   I was joking.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.720]   Am I the...
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.120]   Matt Mcironi?
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.800]   I think this is actually exactly the way the world works, Jeff.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:51.160]   I know you'd like to be a purist but what happens is we have competing interests, one
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.280]   you like, one you don't like.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.040]   They have opposing points of view.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.840]   One of them threatens and other threatens back.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   That's happened.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.480]   A lot of saber rattling.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.600]   And eventually a little diplomacy happens and they come to a mutual agreement and they
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   resolve it.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.160]   I think this is far better than any of the other possible consequences.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.760]   No, the problems I have in that.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.320]   The problem is I have to stop, Jeff.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   Go ahead, Stacey.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.320]   Stacey, go ahead.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.520]   No, I was going to say this is at least done as part of a legislative process and I know
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.120]   that doesn't make it...
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.880]   I guess holier than that but it does make it maybe a little bit more transparent.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.480]   You can see this and if citizens really hate it, they can not vote.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.960]   I know how you feel about this, Jeff.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.480]   I really don't have strong feelings either way about it because I'm a little with Leo's
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.920]   real politics but it could be worse.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.240]   I kind of like the idea that doesn't always have to be legislative solutions.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.040]   I agree with you, Stacey, that in theory a legislative solution is the will of the people
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.840]   but in a way the legislative stick brought the two to the table.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.840]   You know, it's like the Camp David, of course.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.280]   But that legislative stick came from...
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.440]   Here's the problem though.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.280]   It came from Murdoch having politicians literally in his pocket.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.640]   Oh, well that happens all the time, Jeff.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.640]   I mean, that's...
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.640]   You just tell us.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:16.520]   I know but what I did it, it misused, I know, it misused the structure.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:23.800]   If in any normal market, in any sane market, the publishers would have owed Google for
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.960]   the marketing that they received and the traffic they received and the potential customers
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.160]   they got.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.120]   It didn't happen that way because Google chose in its early days not to sell unlike Yahoo,
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.920]   not to sell links in primary search, only in ads.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.400]   And so they never established a market value for that.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.560]   And so the publishers whined and screamed and said, "You took my picture.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.000]   You stole my soul.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.520]   You owe me eternity."
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:52.400]   But in fact, Google was saying, "No, we took your headline for the purpose of sending
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.440]   a link to you.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.200]   We don't owe you anything for that."
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.160]   But they insisted that they used this PR angle with the politicians to say, "Google
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.160]   stole our content."
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.400]   And Google said, "Fine, we'll stop doing it.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.800]   Use robots.txt.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.800]   We won't do it then.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.960]   There's a simple way.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.960]   Don't do it.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.960]   That's the way the deal works.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.960]   That's the way the internet works."
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.960]   And they said, "No, no, no, no.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.960]   We're going to insist that you steal from us so we can insist you give us money."
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.560]   And we're going to use all of our politicians.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:24.120]   And Google, listen, if Google found value in this news, but when I'm just jumping ahead
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.840]   to Facebook, but let me just mention this, I'm going to bring a little bit of something.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.160]   You're a jump ahead again.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.160]   I want to stop.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.160]   I'm not jumping ahead.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.160]   I'm not jumping ahead.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.520]   I'm making a point.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.200]   Mark Zuckerberg said, "Nobody's going to read this news.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   We know that."
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   He was honest about that.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.720]   Google hasn't said that, but nobody's going to read the showcase.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.360]   They're not going to read news on Google.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.160]   This was done strictly to pay off the blackmail.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.000]   That's what I'm offended by, and they didn't defend the structure of the net.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.760]   These are the proprietors of our net.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.720]   When I'm accused of defending Google and Facebook, I tell you that I'm defending the
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.720]   net instead.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.680]   Well, today I'm angry that the defenders of the net, especially Google, did not defend
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.680]   the net.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   I'm very angry at it.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.680]   How does this hurt the net?
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:13.280]   Well, it's the net number one, because God knows how publishers and others will use
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.080]   their political capital in the future to do whatever.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.440]   Well, they might hurt the net down the road, but how does this hurt the net?
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   This hurts the net because even though they're not officially paying for lengths, they're
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.600]   paying for lengths.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.480]   That's what happened here.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.840]   There's no rational market exchange going on here.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:37.120]   Google said, "Okay, well, we'll make a news thing and we'll put some news there and we'll
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.880]   syndicate it from the associated press used to work.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.760]   And then if we pay enough money, you'll stop doing that other thing."
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:53.840]   But in fact, it is these guys saying, "Pay us for linking to us."
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.160]   And Sir Tim Berners- I think in the lecture of the Australian authorities and said this
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.160]   breaks the web.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.080]   In a perfect world, it doesn't break the web.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.480]   In a perfect world, you make a very good case.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.520]   It's a little hypocritical for news organizations who could just block Google's spider and not
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.080]   have to worry about snippets to say, "No, no, no.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.760]   We want to show up in your search results and we want you to pay us for that."
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   So that's hypocritical.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.760]   I agree with you.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.760]   Right.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.960]   And people could have had the freedom to say.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:27.000]   Google could also have the freedom to say, "Sorry, news organizations.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   We're not going to pay you.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   So what happened to Spain?
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   We'll just leave."
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Right.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   That's what I don't think-
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   But that-
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   But then there were tools-
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   But then there were tools-
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   I don't think that's a good outcome.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   I think this is a better outcome.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I agree.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:45.160]   But Google was told, "You can't even do that.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.600]   You can't use your own freedom to make a market choice on your own.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.280]   We're going to force you to pay even if you don't get anything."
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.480]   But I think you're talking about an ideal world.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.760]   And in this case, I think we've got a pretty good agreement that is not going to hurt the
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.320]   Internet.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.960]   I don't think this hurts the Internet.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:06.160]   Jeff, how do you feel about like substack and newsletters because there's no robot text
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.160]   for these guys?
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.200]   So if I want something published or searched by Google, I put it online.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:18.840]   So there's an opportunity for people for the media business to not have their stuff accessible
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.840]   online for search.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.600]   Is stuff behind a paywall?
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.520]   Like the Financial Times, is that get spider-
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.400]   No, that's still searchable in spiders.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:30.360]   But newsletters like substack and stuff like that, it's not.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:39.000]   So if I only publish to my subscribers, it's only those subscribers that ever get it and
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.400]   see it and know it exists.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.400]   That harms you in one respect because you don't have discoverability.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:49.160]   It's why Jeff publishes on Medium because he wants people to find his publishing.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.360]   It harms me, but it also harms the overall conversation.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.360]   Yes, I agree.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.560]   As a journalist, I wouldn't...
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:01.600]   I mean, Google's not really taking money for me, but as a publisher.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.000]   Also, as a journalist, I need my work to be out there because otherwise I'm just shouting
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.440]   out a void and there's no fun there.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   I agree.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.240]   In a perfect world, there'd be a free flow of information.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.480]   There'd be no paywalls and everybody be able to see everything.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.480]   No, there has to be a way to make money.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.480]   But you have to make a way to make money.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.480]   Hold on there, hold on there, buddy.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.960]   Go to...the Financial Times has a pretty hard paywall, which you can't get passed because
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.600]   you keep on trying to go past it.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.760]   And the Financial Times knows that, in part from Google, telling them, "This guy Leo,
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.760]   he comes in all the time.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.760]   Don't give him nothing.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.920]   Just make sure you don't eat Google and tell him that."
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.280]   If I go to the Financial Times, they know exactly that I'm doing that.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.280]   But they will...
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.880]   How's it getting various places?
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.040]   Google started to subscribe with Google.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.680]   Google tells Financial Times when this is unlikely.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.920]   If I go through a Google news source to it.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.760]   Yeah, or you've got Google cookies for...
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.360]   But I mean, honestly, anybody who was paying for those who's hitting the paywall without
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.880]   the help of any third party.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.520]   It depends on whether you're doing it through mobile and through your browser and through
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   your other browser.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.840]   Google knows who you are all the time across many places.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   Right, right.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.840]   Yes.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   So Google is making...
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.320]   Google is sharing that with publishers.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   I think no one...
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.160]   I think it could stipulate.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.480]   Google makes a lot of money.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.320]   They're very profitable.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.320]   They're willing...
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   So does Rupert Murdoch?
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.600]   I'm sure they don't like it.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.000]   But they're willing to say, "Let's bury the hatchet here.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.200]   Have a pile of money."
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.120]   Maybe Rupert gave them some...
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.800]   Okay, maybe we'll do some joint development deals, it sounds like that, according to the
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.720]   article.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.800]   That might benefit you as well and might benefit the open net as well.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   I think this is gonna be a good problem.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.080]   So let me give you another problem I have.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.080]   So you go ahead and give me the problem I have.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.960]   You could do the next one if you want.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   No, I'm not going to.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.520]   Are you trying to rush me here?
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.520]   Oh, geez.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.520]   Oh, dear.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.520]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.760]   So the other problem is this.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.760]   And this is my routine.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.720]   As far as I'm gonna be political here for a moment, pardon me.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.960]   But as far as I am concerned, my opinion, not Leo's not...
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.680]   Everybody else's my opinion is Rupert Murdoch ruined this country and my family and others.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.240]   And this is the time when journalists should be...
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.240]   Oh, so what you really...
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.880]   You've had about his shocking news.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:24.520]   That's part of it here because if you go to Sky News Australia, it is worse than Fox News.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   Yeah, murder.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.320]   And so he's infecting them.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.320]   He's a good businessman.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.320]   He's also going into...
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.000]   You stimulate the amygdala as somebody in the chatroom said you get lots of news.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.040]   No, well, no, it's worse than that.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   He created...
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   Do you think actually...
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   And so let me just make a point.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   Let me just make a point.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.720]   Let me just make a point real quickly.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.640]   At the time when I think we in journalism should we make decisions and clean our own
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.640]   house?
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.400]   We tell Facebook and Google all the time and Twitter, "You clean your house and we haven't
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.880]   cleaned our own in journalism."
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.560]   So I want to bring journalists together and say, "What do we say about Fox News?
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   What do we say about Breitbart?
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.240]   What do we say about these places?
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.000]   Do we have standards or not?"
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.600]   And if we do, and we try to go to Google and say, "Today when Rush Limbaugh died, the number
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.680]   one story on Google News was Fox News's pay-on to him.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.040]   Is that necessarily the best thing for them to do?
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.040]   Let's have that discussion."
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.720]   Well, now we're not going to have that discussion because Google's paying Fox for this content.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.760]   And if we ever said that we have to a point where Fox got so bad that we said you should
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.520]   take Fox off, how do we have that discussion now?
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.200]   How do we have that?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.560]   And so what happened here, what really upset me was that the Guardian, which went to Australia
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:39.040]   to be the Guardian Angel against Murdoch and raised money for that purpose to be an alternative
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.760]   to Murdoch, they played along with Murdoch in this case for their cynical money.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.840]   I'm profoundly disappointed.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.920]   I'm probably ruining my relationship with the rest of my life by saying this, but I'm terribly
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.200]   disappointed in them for doing that.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.760]   When you say Google News, you mean news.google.com?
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.920]   Is that what you mean?
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.920]   That case, yes.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.360]   Of course, this discussion is more than Google News.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.600]   So that's not what I'm getting.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.600]   I'm getting-
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600]   Use content anywhere.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600]   That's not what I'm getting.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.360]   I'm getting Los Angeles Times is the first article.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.520]   Then when I went to full coverage-
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.520]   It was earlier today.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.280]   LA Times, Fox News, Washington Post, CNN.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.280]   I'm then getting-
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.280]   It was hours ago.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.280]   Okay.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.040]   I see the New York Times.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.040]   All right.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:21.800]   But is it your assertion that because Murdoch gave them money that Fox News appeared first?
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   No, no.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   It's my assertion that if we try to have a discussion with them about maybe Fox News
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.440]   shouldn't be promoted, that's kind of-
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.160]   That's the way they detour it around that.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.080]   We can't really have that discussion now.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.400]   They have endorsed Fox News.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.640]   They have endorsed Murdoch's outlets by deciding to pay them.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   And here's the other thing.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.360]   Then you can go on the next one.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.840]   The irony of all this regulation, the paradox of all this regulation, is that every time
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.000]   they try to take power away from the platforms they get more.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Try to put this before.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Right.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.800]   To be forgotten, Google decides what we remember.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.480]   That's DG in Germany.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:01.120]   Facebook decides what is hate or not legally.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.880]   Now Google's in a position where they decide which news organizations to avoid with money
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.720]   and which ones not to.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.080]   Under this legislation.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.160]   And so that puts them in a position of much more power.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:20.120]   And my fear is that it's going to be a lot harder for any startup, any wacky little site
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:25.520]   to get going here and get any of this benefit from the news showcase, from the promotion
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.720]   and traffic there, or the money, or anything else.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.120]   And so Murdoch won either way.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.360]   If Google had left, he's got all the brands.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.360]   He's fine.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.360]   He stays stay.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.360]   He got a bunch of money.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.800]   Just to say, nah, nah, and either way, that grates the hell out of me.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.800]   That's all.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   Thank you.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   I got it.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.760]   We'll have more with the Jeff Jarvis show in just a moment, but we're going to take a
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.880]   break and then it's actually going to be the carrot at all.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.480]   I don't think he cared at all.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.480]   Not a bit.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.200]   It's just a very neutral observer.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:00.640]   And then I do want to talk about snow cone with Stacy who's freezing.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:10.040]   But first a word from Linode, I love Linode managing your complex cloud infrastructure
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.520]   should not be hard.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.520]   It isn't with Linode.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.800]   In fact, I've been a Linode user for, I want to say a decade.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.560]   I don't know if they've been around that long.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.480]   I remember I first became aware of Linode because, well, it's Linux hosting, which is
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   awesome.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   Love that.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.280]   Linode makes cloud computing available to everyone.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.360]   Buy your cloud infrastructure with Linode's Linux virtual machines and you'll be developing,
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.200]   deploying and scaling your modern applications faster and easier.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.800]   800,000 developers use Linode for a number of reasons.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.920]   I picked them because they were fast and inexpensive, but a lot of people say the intuitive cloud
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.400]   manager and the full featured API is a feature they're looking for.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.040]   Linode has data centers all over the world.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.760]   And the beauty part is you don't pay more or less for any one of them.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.280]   It's a simple, consistent pricing regardless of location.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.200]   Just choose the data center closest to you and you're good to go or closest to your customers
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.360]   if you want.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.040]   The support from Linode is great.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:14.320]   They're geeks like us and they don't care if you've got a big plan or a little plan.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:20.000]   They care about getting the job done 24/7, 365 days a year.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.520]   No handoffs, no tears.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.240]   You will immediately get somebody who can help you, who can get the job done.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.360]   So think of what you can do with leading price performance, Linode.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.240]   I mean, look at comparisons.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.160]   You can host your website, build an app.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.480]   Actually, that's kind of what I do.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.440]   I'm not an app developer, but I am a hobbyist and having a server or two or three or four
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:50.880]   on Linode makes it very easy for me to try stuff, to host my password vault, for instance,
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.880]   things like that.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.160]   You could store a backup media.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:59.080]   You can launch and enrich your developer applications, hosted services, web sites, AI
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:04.880]   and machine learning workloads, gaming services or CI/CD environments, launch and scale in
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.600]   the cloud with their virtual machines.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.080]   You could choose shared or dedicated compute instances.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.680]   And we're going to give you a $100 credit, which you could even use on S3 compatible
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.600]   objects, storage or managed Kubernetes.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   You get the idea.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.800]   Really, anything you want to do, you can do it, Linode.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:28.400]   It also is a great, as I think this is kind of the open source model.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.040]   They share what they know.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   They share information.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.240]   They have a fabulous free YouTube channel.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:39.900]   There's lots of video tutorials, security tips, just good stuff at youtube.com/linode.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.600]   L-I-N-O-D-E.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:48.440]   Take a look at the testimonials at linode.com.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.760]   Bryce Adams from Mediorek, for instance.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:55.440]   From the start, this is the quote, "We were looking for a partner, not a provider.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.360]   Some of the large providers, no names, CS only as a transaction, linode is the kind of
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.880]   partner that will be with us from the start today and beyond."
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.480]   Simplify your infrastructure.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:12.400]   Cut your cloud bills in half with Linode's Linux virtual machines.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.000]   Whether you're developing a personal project or managing larger workloads, you deserve
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.320]   simple, affordable and accessible cloud computing solutions.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.000]   That started on Linode today.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   I said something.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.520]   I'm going to stand by it.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.000]   A $100 credit.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.480]   Nice.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:34.400]   For listeners of this week in Google, get all the details at L-I-N-O-D-E, linode.com/twig.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.440]   And if you're not at your desktop, but you want to remember this, just text "twit" to
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:48.000]   47, 47, 47, text "twit" to 47, 47, 47, and you'll get your free credit $100.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Wow.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   That's linode.com/twig.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.800]   Don't forget to use that /twig, too, because that lets us know you saw it here.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.960]   Click on the free account button to get started.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:02.920]   If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode and it runs well.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.960]   Thank you, Linode, for supporting this week in Google.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:12.560]   Actually, before we talk of Snoke on, I kind of want to talk about Fuchsia, because there's
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.560]   some Fuchsia news.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.240]   Stacey has things to say about that, too.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.640]   I don't have a lot of stuff to say, but yes, tell us about it, Leo.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.520]   So Google, according to 9-5-Google, is proposing a way.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.080]   Fuchsia is their next-generation operating system, which they recently open sourced and
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.760]   asked for contributors.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:38.640]   They are proposing a way for Fuchsia to run Android and Linux apps natively.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.760]   So Fuchsia is not Linux, but wouldn't it be cool if you had an operating system that
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:49.040]   could run unmodified Android and Linux apps?
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   It sounds to me...
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.880]   It's not running a shell of NVR.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.680]   No VM, no, no, no.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.680]   No VM.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.680]   No, yeah.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.200]   So it's all doing this natively.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.560]   And I think this is really cool, because it's really interesting, and I'm sorry, it's
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.520]   interesting for the IoT, because a lot of IoT devices, they either run Linux or they run
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.960]   Android, and there are pros and cons to doing each.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.960]   So...
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.560]   But I don't know how it doesn't, and that's what I was curious about.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.560]   I think this would be...
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.560]   Starnix.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:27.120]   ...for a tiny, tiny, tiny group of people.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:33.040]   Even though we have all this IoT stuff out there, having Linux capability running on
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.360]   your phone, I don't know how well that's going to make a device.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   Other way around IoT devices.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.920]   So imagine instead of buying a Chromebook, which runs Chrome OS, and you can get Linux
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.120]   running on Chrome OS, and you can get Android apps, but instead of doing that, running some
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.600]   new computing device running fuchsia, not a phone, but it can run your phone's apps,
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.320]   and it can run Linux apps.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.400]   And you're probably right, this is not...
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   I don't know what Google's intent.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   It's not a consumer, but it's like...
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   It's not an end user thing.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.400]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.840]   But cars, a lot of cars pulled in Android and like built things on Android.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.080]   A lot of appliance makers use it.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:12.480]   Medical device makers are looking at it instead of Windows.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:18.720]   So wait, there's a whole generation of computing that's going to be coming online that needs
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:27.520]   an OS that can last for a long time, that has popular support, but isn't as proprietary
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.440]   as Windows, if that makes sense.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.240]   And this sounds really compelling, maybe.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.840]   I mean, and the other thing is they've been building this.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.520]   I mean, we first heard about fuchsia in 2011.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.520]   Is that right?
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.520]   It was a long time ago.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.520]   And it was a long time ago.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   Not long?
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.400]   Maybe not that long.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:50.960]   So the other thing I think is important and interesting is this is one of the first contributions
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:56.200]   since Google opened up fuchsia to the general populace.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.320]   So this is at googlesource.com.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.960]   And by the way, this is merely a proposal.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.720]   You know, here's the document.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.360]   This document proposes a mechanism for running unmodified Linux programs on fuchsia.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.960]   They're running a user space process whose system interface is compatible with the Linux
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.840]   ABI.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.240]   So it doesn't use the Linux kernel.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:26.800]   It implements the interface in the Starnix, which you mentioned Starnix, which is a compatibility
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   layer.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.680]   So it's not emulation, but it is a translation layer, maybe more like wine.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.560]   Yeah, there's some sort of abstraction in there.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.560]   And I don't know.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.840]   And by the way, Jeff, you're right.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.640]   It was 2016 that we first heard about it.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:45.720]   Oh, but the fact I think I think it's I think that mostly I find this interesting because
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:53.080]   we're starting to see ideas coming from outside of Google that this is this is I'm really
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.800]   curious what Google's intention is with this.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.320]   And I mean, they didn't interview what they say.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.840]   They said a couple of years ago, like in 2019, one of the people working on this said that
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:09.160]   they envision fuchsia for devices that are not phones or laptops.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.840]   So for everything else.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.840]   So that was the thinking there.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.840]   So that could be a car.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.680]   It could be an IoT device.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.680]   It could be your job.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.680]   It could be.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.240]   And remember, that's right.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:29.040]   And we talked last week about Google doing a deal with Ford for Android automotive, but
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.640]   maybe that's also what this would be.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.440]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:38.800]   So back in the day, you know, very early days of the web, I remember when Java came out and
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:47.880]   wow, you could run this application on various OS's right through the web.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.280]   This is like the inverse of that.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:56.440]   Here's an OS that can run applications from any number of other OS's, right?
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:01.040]   So it becomes it does it try to become kind of a universal OS?
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.400]   I think it's mostly a bridge to solve the.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:08.160]   The obvious problem of any new operating system was is it has no apps.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.920]   So I think it's more like, but it sounds more fundamental than that.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.320]   It sounds like it could be.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   It's like wine.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.720]   I mean, when Linux, I think one of the reasons wine existed is because people said, well,
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.840]   I'm not going to use Linux unless I can run Microsoft Office.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.640]   And so wine was designed to scratch that itch.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.480]   And I think it's it is kind of a carrot chicken and egg problem with any new operating system.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:40.000]   So what by the way, whether Starnix will happen is, you know, this is just an idea.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.240]   This isn't even a code sample.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:46.040]   So I'm more interested in the fact.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   Well, the two things.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.960]   One is because it does point us a little bit in a direction of what they might be doing
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:55.320]   with Fuchsia, but also just that we're starting to see now because it's open a little more
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.760]   Fuchsia activity, which I'm glad to see.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.560]   You know, it's always bugged me that we've kind of said, okay, there's, you know, we
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.120]   got a we got maybe four operating systems.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.600]   There's Windows, there's Mac, there's iOS, there's Android.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.120]   Okay, there's four and then there's Linux and BSD.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.560]   So there's six, but there's no room for anymore.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:20.520]   The last, you know, operating system that had a shot at being commercial was BOS almost
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:27.880]   30 years ago, and then when Apple decided not to use BOS, but instead next step for their
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.080]   Macotages, that was the end of BOS.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.400]   And it was those of us who liked BOS were really impressed with BOS.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.000]   It was really, really cool.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   I'd love to see another look at a modern operating system.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.920]   I mean, there's things you would do differently now, particularly designed for security that,
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:52.200]   you know, in a more modern world, we have, we have newer needs, lots of, and I presume
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   future we would.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.440]   Isn't that what Apple is trying to do now with, isn't that what Apple is trying to
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:04.640]   do now with its bit of a synergy between Mac OS and iPad OS and so forth?
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:10.280]   Yeah, I mean, when they announced iOS, when the iPhone was announced, it was, they said
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.240]   it's really the OS 10 kernel in a phone operating system.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:21.960]   I think there's more in common between iOS and Mac OS under the hood.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:29.040]   I think you could almost say there's one iOS from Apple designed for different platforms.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.320]   Is there a legal issue these days?
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.120]   I'm going back to my early days as well.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:39.880]   So let's say that, let's say that this also works with Mac OS, just for the heck of it.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:49.880]   Is that, is that if it doesn't use any Mac core logic, but it's still able to be compatible,
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:56.400]   is that a problem with copyright or trademark or patents or anything?
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.880]   I'm sure Apple's lawyers will find a way.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:06.000]   Well, remember the Google Oracle debate was sort of over that whether Google could make
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   a Java clone not by taking any of the code, but by just duplicating the programming interface,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.320]   the API, that's still to be determined, right?
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.320]   They haven't.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.320]   It's still not determined.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.520]   Yeah, they haven't rolled on that yet, but it doesn't look good to be honest with you.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.520]   I don't know.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.600]   That's an interesting question.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:37.520]   Wine on Linux works not by putting any Windows code on Linux, but just by responding to Windows
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.760]   system calls in the way Windows would.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:45.640]   So when a, and it, it has a bit of a tweaking for every app, but when an app is running
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.320]   under wine, it's, it thinks it's running under Windows.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.960]   It's really running on Linux.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:57.680]   And any time it makes a Windows call, wine intercepts it and says, "Oh, yeah, here."
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   You want to open a window?
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   Okay, here.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.800]   And that's actually an interesting way to work.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:08.200]   I don't know what the Oracle Google judgment would have, how that would affect wine, because
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.840]   wine is kind of doing the same thing.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.960]   It's imitating Windows APIs.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.480]   It's actually really more in imitating system calls.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.480]   But I don't know.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.480]   That's it.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.480]   It becomes a different architectural world.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   I remember you said a few minutes ago with...
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.680]   Yeah, you're a little latent.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.360]   And I don't mean anything bad by that.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.360]   But go ahead.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.360]   Keep freezing over there.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.360]   Go ahead.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.480]   Ask your question.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:46.680]   You said that wine was sort of the way to scratch the itch for the folks in Linux.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.560]   And I don't know if it even scratched that itch.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.200]   I mean, granted it could open a few things here and there, but just how functional was
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:59.880]   it to be able to get day to day done without jumping through a gazillion hoops of wine
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.960]   in the configuration?
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.960]   I hated it.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:03.960]   I think it was a transitional technology.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.280]   And it is now not as important because there's LibreOffice.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   There's all sorts of...
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.240]   I mean, I think almost anything you want to do, Linux has a great open source alternative
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.400]   to.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   So did you try to run...
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.400]   That took a long time.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.880]   Yeah, it took a long time though.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.040]   Did you try to run Photoshop on Linux?
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.200]   Is that what you were doing?
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.720]   A Lightroom?
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:29.280]   No, I didn't try Photoshop.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.280]   No.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.280]   Didn't try Photoshop.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.280]   I remember just trying to fight with spreadsheet.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.280]   It was hard.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.080]   And I don't think it's as important as it used to be.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.720]   Honestly, I think I don't ever feel like I can't do anything I want to do in Linux.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.800]   Probably in many cases better than I could do it on Windows.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.320]   But I'm a little bit biased in that regard.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:41:01.400]   All right, let's talk about Snookoon, which is not necessarily the name of Android 12,
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.040]   but it is the right letter.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.160]   Oh, I thought they decided it was Snokeon.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.160]   Did they announce?
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.960]   I decided Snokeon.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   What happened?
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.960]   Hold on.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.120]   Well, this is what they say on XDA developers.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:19.240]   Google has ditched the dessert themed names ever since Android 10 was released.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.440]   While the next version of Android has not been confirmed for its name yet, it's just
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.400]   numbers and logic at this stage.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:29.040]   However, with that being said, Google still continues to use the dessert themed names in
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.680]   its internal code base.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:39.120]   Android 10 was sneakily called Quince Tarte.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.120]   Android 11 was red velvet cake, but you never heard that in public, right?
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.840]   It was just internally.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:56.880]   And it's not clear if it's Snokeon, but apparently, XDA developers has found some evidence.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.880]   Let me see here.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.200]   Google, how can you rob the fun from us?
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.200]   Was that nice?
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:10.480]   A lot of the development branches, XDA developers say, are prefaced with SC.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:15.880]   It was last time RVC for red velvet cake.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.720]   SC could be other things.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.720]   Anything else?
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.720]   Shortcake.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.720]   Shortcake.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:30.120]   But XDA seems convinced this probably Snokeon.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.560]   Anyway, strawberry cake.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.560]   Strawberry cake.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   Stretch.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.560]   Stretch.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.680]   So anyway, sugar cookie.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.680]   Sugar cookie.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.680]   Oh, there you go.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.680]   Yeah, there's a winner.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.680]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.680]   If one needs dessert names.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.200]   But like, I can come up more.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   Give us more.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.320]   Give us more.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.760]   So there is a lot of information.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.040]   XDA developers about Android 12.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.840]   I feel bad.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.840]   I don't care about it anymore.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.840]   What?
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.520]   I really don't.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:10.640]   I'm right there with you when I saw that this information was announced or leaked or whatever.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.120]   It didn't really excite me anymore because I don't know how much more innovation can
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:19.440]   be done to wait a minute.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.440]   Wait.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.440]   Wait.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.440]   So Stacey.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:28.440]   Oh, that's just another notification that people are going to indicate your phone.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.640]   People are just going to ignore those notifications.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.640]   Wipe them away.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.320]   It's visual on screen.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.960]   It's on your home screen.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.720]   Is it kind of Apple style privacy?
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.720]   Somebody said.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.720]   Let's see.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.720]   Let me find it.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.720]   Privacy indicators.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.480]   Here they are.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.480]   Here they are.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.840]   Privacy indicators and privacy setting changes.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:54.840]   The screenshots below show what looks like privacy indicators.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.320]   Users could receive a warning in the status bar.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.000]   Get up at the top here.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.760]   The little green thing.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.720]   I can't quite see it.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:10.600]   I guess that the microphone is on and maybe that's a camera on and you can then, according
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.600]   to XDA developers.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.240]   It looks like both the microphone and camera.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:21.720]   Tap it and it would tell you which apps are using the camera or microphone.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.280]   So Leo, can I try to answer your point about Android?
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.280]   Yes.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.200]   I think given this and the conversations we just had.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.040]   I think it's operating systems you don't care about.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.920]   I care a lot about operating systems.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.320]   No, I care a lot about operating systems.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.080]   No, but what's really new?
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.080]   They kind of work.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.480]   It's like the phones themselves are commodified now.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.640]   It's not a big deal.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.120]   We used to care a lot about these changes with new capabilities.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.120]   We really don't.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.000]   They're minor things that can be added anytime.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.400]   The fact that they get added with the new OS, who cares?
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.400]   That's where I am.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.560]   I think it's the OS that's gotten boring.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.440]   It's not much that we can do right now from an innovation standpoint that's going to impress
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.440]   me.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.080]   Well, wait, y'all.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.080]   Hold on.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.080]   Hold on.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.400]   Chase, he's founded.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.400]   No, no.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:18.000]   We're in this really cool area where we're shifting from just phones and computers to everywhere.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.400]   So we're going to actually have a whole bunch of cool new operating systems.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.400]   Or maybe a bunch.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.440]   Or computing at the edge.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.440]   For computing at the edge.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.440]   For futures, yeah.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.120]   There's whole different areas.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.520]   So you've got to think, if you're thinking about this, you've got to think about things
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:39.240]   like something that's flexible enough to scale up and down for memory requirements.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.000]   You've got to think about power consumption, how to draw things back and down.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.640]   You also have to think about longevity of the devices.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.000]   A computer and a phone only lasts for like five years.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.800]   So there's actually, and then when you think about security, you've also got to have a
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:57.080]   cloud connection, but you also have security on the device in some sort of tokenization
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:02.080]   that helps like, or PKI, basically, that it's like going to give you a token that you check
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.320]   in the cloud and everything.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.960]   So I know, Jeff, but just take it's going to get exciting soon.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.520]   And I think fuchsia is possibly part of that.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.520]   I don't know.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.320]   Those are the things I'm looking for in these things.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:20.400]   Or, or what I'm trying to say is, fuchsia commodifies all the OSs if it can operate apps
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.880]   from multiple OSs.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.280]   It's actually not what's bothering me about Android.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:29.240]   And it's the same thing bothering me about Chrome, which is not an OS, which is that-
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.240]   You watch it, fella.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.240]   Watch it.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.240]   Watch it.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.240]   I stopped using both because Google is an advertising company.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:43.120]   And while Apple has said, look, we're going to give you app tracking information and we're
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.600]   going to let you know what's going on in privacy wise.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:51.760]   And I think Google's commitment to that in both Chrome and Android has really been lagging.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.400]   And honestly, I don't have a problem with this.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:59.560]   It's not like there aren't at least as good solutions, if not better solutions out there.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.920]   I don't feel just as I don't feel the need to use Facebook.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.920]   I don't feel the need to use Chrome or Android anymore.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.760]   Because honestly, I think that they don't trust them.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   Okay.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   Bad boy.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.760]   That's fair.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:17.880]   I will say I would like to see more effort from Google to make these phones a little bit
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.040]   more useful when you travel internationally, because it seems like whenever I speak to
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.320]   people that traveled internationally, the last thing they want to take is an Android device.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.600]   Oh, that's not true for me.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.720]   Well, for security reasons, yeah.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:36.640]   But I always use Google Fi or T-Mobile on an Android phone traveling because it's the most
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.040]   compatible solution.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.040]   But you're right.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:44.080]   From the point of view of security, I think that's what matters because I'm like, I
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.080]   call really kind of matters.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:50.160]   Yeah, I'm sure I'll be online if I was internationally traveling.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.040]   I guess I can use Fi on the iPhone.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:57.800]   But you should travel with a burner phone with nothing on your device.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.960]   And really the risk, the privacy issue is not when you're and security issue maybe even
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:07.040]   is not when you're overseas is when you're crossing the border, the American border.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.040]   That's the real.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.080]   There's the risk right there.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.960]   I don't know, I'm willing to be talked off this ledge, but I don't feel like Google's
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:15.960]   commitment.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   Oh, no, you're not.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.960]   Oh, no, you're not.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.120]   You like being on that ledge.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.640]   Well, if you don't want to talk me off the ledge, I'll stay up here.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:28.760]   But I feel like Google's commitment to privacy is half-hearted.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.000]   And I'm not alone, by the way.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   Apple's is accidental.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.040]   Apple's is accidental, but it is.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.040]   But it is.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.040]   But it exists.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.040]   But it's marketing the hell out of it.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.760]   And it's doubling down on it in as much as it can.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.640]   I do think people are, I mean, Kevin has dumped all his Google stuff and went over to Apple
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.840]   and I never thought I'd see that day.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.840]   What?
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.640]   Yeah, he's a terrible Google file.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.680]   He's Google-fied his phones and everything.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.080]   Even the Android phones he tried to do Google.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.440]   It's kind of the same for me too.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.120]   He dumped his Android phones.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.600]   He was running a weird something.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:08.320]   And by the way, I am not happy with Apple's walled garden approach and its ecosystem approach.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.000]   I think that that's exactly the wrong thing.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.480]   I'm much more in favor of open stuff, but it does work better.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.840]   And you just want to use Clubhouse, I know.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.840]   Oh, there it is.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.840]   That's all about Clubhouse.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.240]   I was waiting for that.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.240]   You know what?
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.240]   I put Clubhouse.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:28.320]   I got inundated by people like, why aren't you on Clubhouse?
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.320]   Why are you?
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.320]   The said you weren't on Clubhouse.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.600]   I'm on my iPad mini and I still haven't done one, but I don't know.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.200]   No, Clubhouse is just the latest flavor.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.920]   I'm all over Pinterest now.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.560]   That's my new thing.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.400]   It's back.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.400]   Pinterest has never left.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:50.760]   I mean, I sit there, our house designer, when we were doing our renovations.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.360]   These were like boring renovations.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:57.760]   The most exciting thing was replacing the floors, but the rest of it was like, hey, this bathroom
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.960]   toilet is falling apart.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.560]   You know, he's like, just put a bunch of the toilets you like on Pinterest.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.560]   And I'm like, yeah.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   Yes.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.560]   Yes.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.560]   It's a big deal.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.560]   My daughter loves it.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.560]   Pinboard.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:19.640]   It's like a pinboard sort of, but it's, it's, or as we were talking about on Windows Weekly
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:24.840]   earlier, the reason it came up on Windows Weekly is because there's a financial times
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:30.680]   published an article saying that Microsoft was interested in purchasing Pinterest for
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.840]   stand backs, sit down, watch out.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.440]   Here it comes 50, $5,000,000,000.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.800]   Dear God.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   Which is an astounding figure.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.240]   Microsoft, you still wouldn't be cool.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.280]   I don't think they want to be cool.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.280]   It puzzled me at first.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.840]   And then I thought about it.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:54.200]   Pinterest is two things that Microsoft would love.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:58.960]   First of all, like Instagram, it's an ad magnet because when you're, when you're scrolling
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:05.680]   through these, some of these tiles are contributed by people, but some of them are ads and they
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.280]   look exactly like it's hard to tell.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.440]   Just like Instagram and you're in there.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:15.920]   And because the second part of Pinterest is you basically on Pinterest, you just put
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.760]   stuff you're interested in and it's yeah, I was buying toilets stuff.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:27.120]   So you told, you told Pinterest, I want to buy these toilets given a signal, big signal.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.620]   Big signal.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:34.880]   And so I love it because my Pinterest is full of food recipes and diet advertisements.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:35.880]   So it works.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.840]   We're so well together.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:43.440]   It's a, it's a perfect blend of all the things.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:47.440]   So I could see, I don't know if it's worth $50 billion.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:51.480]   It's kind of a mind boggling number given that Instagram was one.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.480]   I don't think the numbers.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.040]   Yeah, I don't think the numbers really mean anything anymore.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.560]   I mean, a look at their, I'm sure that wasn't in cash.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.800]   I'm sure there was a large component in stock.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.560]   So yeah, coin.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:06.800]   Well, and even WhatsApp, which was a very good purchase for Facebook was only 22 billion.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.800]   And at the time we were like, bold over by that number.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.040]   This is more than twice that.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.720]   It's more than Microsoft paid for Nokia.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.720]   It's much.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:18.240]   It's more than Microsoft paid for LinkedIn much.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.080]   It's more than Microsoft paid for Gitta.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.520]   It's, it's an astounding number.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:27.680]   By the way, the latest is apparently that those negotiations are not currently active.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.920]   But the, I think the financial times is probably a good source for this kind of stuff.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:35.880]   So meanwhile, I don't even know the demographic of Pinterest anymore.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:40.720]   As you know, back in the days, you would pull up an app and they'd say, Hey, everybody's
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:45.360]   using it is between 18 and 30 or something like that.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:48.080]   And women and lots of, but now I don't know any.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:51.960]   The tech industry made so much fun of it.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:55.960]   Like very early on, there's a lot of denigration of pictures.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.720]   And I'm like, Oh, it was actually something new.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.320]   I follow Trey rekla fun here.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:05.600]   He has a board of his favorite travel photos.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:10.400]   I mean, it's, you know, it's, it's got lots of good stuff on it.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.400]   It's kind of like an account.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.920]   And I don't remember the last time I used it.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.960]   Well, here are here, but I might get back into it.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.960]   I'm going to try to get in.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.960]   So it's there.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:20.960]   It's funny.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.720]   I hadn't, or I could, I could promote my wellness ritual.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:24.720]   There you go.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.720]   Do you have one?
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.520]   No, you kidding me?
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.280]   Yes, he does eat, catch or tippy.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:36.480]   But every other week, every other week, that's right.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.480]   Stacey.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.920]   I, I'm good about that.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.920]   And this is my week.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:44.360]   Yeah, when I said I was concerned about you, I was much relieved to hear that.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.720]   So my parents have power now.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   Wow.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.960]   Are they in Houston or Austin?
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.960]   Are they in Houston?
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   They're in Houston.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.960]   Houston.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   Houston.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:58.320]   And my brother who is outside of Houston in like a very not awesome area, he also got
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   power.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.320]   Oh, good.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.520]   That's great news.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.040]   Did they lose water at any point?
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.240]   I think they're under a boil water notice, but I, I'm less worried about that because
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:12.560]   they have lots of water and my parents, you know, they're, I know that they don't
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.560]   think they're, they're, they're older.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.760]   Oh, no, they prefer single malt, single barrels.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.760]   There you go.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.760]   Single malt.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.760]   Yes.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.760]   Chromebooks.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   Jeff.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:35.720]   Just as you were, just as you were dismissing them with chrome outsold Mac and Tasha's worldwide
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.160]   in that can talk fanboy.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.160]   Take that.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.160]   Well, that makes sense.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.760]   Mr. Jeremy's come on.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.120]   Don't, don't, don't go over this.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:46.120]   I mean, we're in the pandemic where people are not making any money.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.600]   They're going for the cheapest thing that they can find.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:49.600]   Yes.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:50.600]   Just to get there.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.600]   They're discovering how wonderful it is.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.600]   And it's a great thing.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.680]   I don't think they care.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.160]   All they want to know is can this thing get on zoom?
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.160]   Yes or no?
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.160]   Yes.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.160]   I think it on Hangouts.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.160]   Yes or no?
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.160]   Done.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:05.680]   A lot of, a lot of kids, a lot of students, you know, people realized if we've got a lot of
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.680]   businesses to, I think, businesses, you think, doing Chromebooks?
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:10.680]   I think so.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:14.040]   Just because people had, you know, they had the desktop at the office or they had their
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.040]   office machine or whatever.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.440]   I think there was an, I think there was some of that too.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.960]   I saw a lot of talk about, I need 20 machines suddenly.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:22.960]   IDC.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   Small businesses.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:31.760]   IDC, which includes desktops, laptops and workstations, worldwide market share, dropping
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:39.960]   from Microsoft from about 90% to 75% kind of flat to dropping for Mac OS.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.000]   That's the green bar, the purple bar.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.280]   Nice steady growth for Chrome OS.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.400]   I mean, it's still under 25%.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.120]   But it was good growth.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:54.920]   Windows is still 87.5% market share.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.280]   Mac OS 5.8.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.280]   This is in Q1 2020.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.520]   This is a year ago.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.000]   Chrome OS captured 5.3 and Q2.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.960]   Windows fell 81.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.440]   Mac OS grew to 7.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.800]   Chrome OS jumped to 10.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.600]   Q3 and Q4 of last year.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:17.120]   Windows dropped further to 79% for Q3 than 77% for Q4.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:20.880]   Mac OS grew for Q3 than back down for Q4.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.040]   Possibly because they had new chips coming out.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.880]   Might have slowed down the sales.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:33.600]   Mac OS had 11.5% for Q3 and a 14.4% share in Q4.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:37.000]   So big, big year for Chromebook.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   And not a surprise.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   Can I just gloat a little bit and be the next one of me?
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   Good luck, stop.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.360]   When I sat down with the keyboard and they thought I was ridiculous and they thought
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.600]   all this thing won't last.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.880]   And I've been on it for like five years and I've been happy.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.680]   Can I gloat a little bit that I'm not alone anymore please?
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.600]   So five years means that it has lasted.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.920]   Is what you're saying?
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.920]   That's longevity to you.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.920]   Five years.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   Well, I'm not that old.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:09.120]   It's only about five years old on the land.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.840]   I mean, we just said that-
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:15.560]   What do you want the 30-year-old OS?
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.040]   Most phones aren't any good for like four years or so.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.920]   Hey, you really want to hurt Google.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:25.960]   You can have 1.1 million euros and see them Yelp.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.600]   That's like the interest from one second.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:34.480]   Yeah, that's like when, you know, I don't know, someone comes up to me and like asks
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.480]   for a dollar.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.480]   You don't even want that back.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:38.480]   You're just like, yeah, take the dog.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.000]   I'm not going to bend over to pick up that nickel.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.440]   It's not worth it.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:46.840]   Google's Ireland, Google, Ireland, Google, France have agreed to pay a stunning $1.34
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:54.760]   million fine after a probe found that Google's hotel rankings could be misleading for consumers.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:59.200]   Do you think the French are blackmailing Google, Jeff?
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.560]   No, they're just French.
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:04.640]   I had a look on his face.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:08.680]   Honestly, why even bother?
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:13.480]   Do you think that statutorily said like that that was the most I could ask for?
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:17.160]   And this is Stacy is like me going, Stacy, I don't like you.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.160]   Give me a dollar.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:23.160]   Oh, I was going to say it's like, hey, I'm short a little bit for the tip.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.160]   Do you have a buck?
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.160]   I'd be like, yeah, sure.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.160]   Whatever.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.160]   Don't have to say it.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.160]   You would straight to I don't like you.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.160]   Okay.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   Okay.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.160]   Sorry.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.480]   I am never going to San Francisco again.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:39.680]   Waymo has just begun robo taxi tests in San Francisco.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.680]   It's terrifying.
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.480]   This is a great time for robots.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:44.720]   Actually, I would think there's.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:45.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:48.200]   Because you don't want to get a car with an Uber driver, do you?
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.200]   That's actually a good point.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.200]   No, less traffic.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.200]   No, no, Jaguar.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:55.440]   No, that'd be nice to jag.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.440]   Jag.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.440]   Is that a jag?
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.440]   Is that an eyepace?
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.440]   Let's see here.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.440]   Yeah, they're driving.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.400]   Well, it's either a Chrysler Pacifica or an eyepace.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.400]   I think it's an eyepace.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.560]   That doesn't look like a Chrysler Pacifica.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:11.000]   The eyepace is not the Jaguar you're thinking of.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:17.840]   By the way, Jaguar has decided not to make the XKE or whatever its modern equivalent
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.800]   is electric yet.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.800]   Aww.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.200]   I would like a fancy.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.760]   I would buy that so fast.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:32.640]   A fancy fast electric car that is like my Tesla, but maybe a little not like my Tesla.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.760]   You know what I want, but I can't afford.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:38.360]   I just got my Ford Mach E last night and it's really nice.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.360]   Oh, it's pretty.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.360]   But what I want.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:43.360]   I'll have to studio it.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:44.360]   Isn't it pretty?
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.360]   It's pretty.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:53.760]   What I actually want, Stacey, and if I had your money, I would buy is the Audi Etron GT.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.320]   Yes.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.720]   Is that a beautiful car?
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.720]   Yes.
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   Two of all the good Audi.
[00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:59.720]   Let's see.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.120]   Ooh, it's only a hundred thou.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.520]   It's only a hundred thou.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.120]   But it's the same platform as the Porsche Taycon.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:11.120]   So it's a nice speedy drive, but it is like kind of a luxury.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.920]   Oh, that's so pretty.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.680]   If I buy all my cars used, I won't buy a new car.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.680]   Well, good.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.200]   Next year, you're going to use one of these because, you know, the rich people buy these.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.840]   They don't want to drive them from one of the year.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.840]   Exactly.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.840]   I think the tail lights are stupid looking.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.840]   Oh, it's all dusty.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.840]   Muffy.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.840]   Buy another one.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.840]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.120]   I don't like the tail lights.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.480]   I think you would actually like the Mach E. But you won't be able to get used one.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.920]   And yet I just got a new one.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.440]   So you have to wait a year or two for that.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.440]   That's OK.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.440]   I'm patient.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.440]   I don't really drive anything.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.800]   What do you think now from this is the back view of those lights of the rear lights?
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.640]   Oh, they're better in the back.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.640]   OK.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.640]   Yeah, that's not so bad.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.640]   It's very Audi.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.800]   The arrows were just kind of gimmicky.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.800]   And look at that.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.800]   The inside looks nice.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.800]   I like the red.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.800]   It looks like the red.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.800]   Mmm.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.800]   It's pretty red.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.800]   Excess.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800]   How does your new car drive, Leo?
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800]   Beautifully.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:01.800]   Beautifully.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.800]   It has.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.920]   You know, it's-- I had a Tesla with not ludicrous, not the highest acceleration.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.920]   Right.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.360]   The insane it was called mode.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:18.920]   But in order to do the insane mode, you have to stop the car, push both the brake and the
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.240]   accelerator all the way.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.240]   Wait a second.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.240]   And then suddenly release them.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.800]   And then it launches you forward.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.800]   God.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.160]   And I used to take people on rides.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.160]   But I realized I was getting-- I was almost retting.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.160]   I was retting out.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.440]   I was almost-- I was getting lightheaded from the acceleration.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.120]   And I thought, this is not safe.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.120]   Oh, my god.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.120]   So I--
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.120]   That's bad, huh?
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.120]   I stopped doing that.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.960]   I'm afraid nobody took me on ludicrous speed.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.760]   And that is not actually a speed for humans.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.760]   That is dangerous.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.760]   It's not good.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.760]   It's dangerous.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.760]   It's dangerous.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:57.160]   So the normal acceleration and pepiness of a Model X, I've apps-- or a Model S in Stacey's
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.720]   case, I've absolutely-- it's absolutely does that.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.640]   And you put your pedal to the metal and it goes, gee.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.560]   And it has little propulsion sounds that make it-- depending on-- you have three settings.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.240]   Depending on how aggressive the setting is, it can sound like an actual Mustang.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.080]   They actually pipe audio into the cab.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.360]   I don't need that.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.720]   You could turn that off.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.720]   It's very comfy.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.720]   I was in my car with silent.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.720]   I'm not silent.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.720]   I like that.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.720]   I killed squirrels, but I like that.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.720]   No, I like that.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.200]   And they-- you know, this is where I think Ford has a little edge over Tesla because they've
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.480]   been making cars for a while.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.800]   The cabin is very quiet, much more quiet than my Tesla was.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.800]   When Tesla's rattly and--
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.200]   You know, does it have cup holders in the back?
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.200]   It does.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.200]   It does.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.200]   It does.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.200]   It has cup holders.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.200]   This is weird.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.200]   It has cup holders in the front.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.000]   For your body that you're storing, there?
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.400]   No, that-- I realized--
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.400]   Allegedly.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.160]   So this was a late edition of this design.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.400]   The front, like you have in your S because there's no engine.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.480]   So there's a front trunk, AKA a frunk, that's small, but you could put a three grocery bags
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.200]   in there or whatever.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.360]   You could also put a body in there.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.200]   And I realized what happened is there's a law that requires that if you do have a space
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.560]   like that, there should be an internal emergency release.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.120]   So there's somebody's in there that can get out.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.680]   The Ford doesn't have that.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:23.360]   So as a last minute fix, they put dividers in there and a drain.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.360]   So you could fill it with ice.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.360]   It's got a drain.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.200]   So the ice will melt and drain out.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.200]   It's for tailgating.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.200]   Tailgating.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.200]   And it has cup holders.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.200]   We're going to take you to--
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.200]   Okay.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.480]   Blind beer can holders, huh?
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.400]   Well, something holders.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.520]   And I think the point of it is you can't put a body in there anymore because the fighters
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.320]   make it so you can't fit unless it's a small body, smaller body.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.800]   You could put a very small body in there.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.840]   And actually the ice might be handy in that case.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:49.840]   We stored--
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.840]   Let's see how small is this.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.400]   --Christmas presents in the frunk.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.400]   Perfect.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.120]   It was actually brilliant because I forgot the frunk existed.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.560]   I'm notorious for pirating through all my presents.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.560]   Right.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.560]   So--
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.560]   See, Andrew is smart.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.560]   Or for like two years.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.560]   Oh, wow.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:08.240]   Oh, you figured it out now.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:14.720]   Well, only because I was to store Anna's Christmas presents in there.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.080]   I wonder where they're doing this testing in San Francisco.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.480]   I know they've made a couple infrastructure changes in San Francisco as far as some streets
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.320]   are not drivable anymore.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.080]   They're only for pedestrians walking around.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.080]   I wonder what's been gated off to do this testing and what type of testing are they
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.080]   doing to--
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.920]   Well, one of the things they've done, they've optimized Waymo's optimized the-- what they
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:43.120]   call Waymo driver, the self-driving software for San Francisco.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.800]   It has additional cameras to spot Jaywalkers.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   Because there's anybody's--
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.800]   --is just going to--
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.720]   People just wander into the street, Willy Nilly.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:57.520]   If the driver, the automated thing pulls up to a bus by a crosswalk, it will presume
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.360]   that there's a bus, there's a crosswalk, people will be walking there.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:06.120]   If it's driving on a street with road work, it understands the traffic codes, cones, and
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:09.520]   signs are meant to guide it out of the usual lane.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.520]   So they've spifted up.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.680]   What about some of those Pacific Heights hills?
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.680]   Wow.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.680]   Ooh.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.680]   Well, you can't see over the hill.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:25.480]   Well, maybe it can, because remember, these things have big stacks on the top with--
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.480]   That's true.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.360]   --you can see it here with LiDARs.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:33.000]   They would probably do a better job than I would sitting on the driver's seat of seeing
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   over that hill.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.400]   Waymo's one of the few companies with a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission,
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.800]   which allows them to provide passenger service.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.040]   Wow.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.040]   So it doesn't say--
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.040]   Oh, you can't.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.040]   Yeah, I would.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.480]   It doesn't say at where they drive.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.120]   I don't remember if it was the last CESU and I attended or if it was one prior to that.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.560]   But I was in Vegas down on the old side of Vegas, and a free-not and all of that.
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:05.720]   And I saw a couple of the cars just zipping around down there.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.600]   And I assumed they were testing and I'm thinking--
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.600]   They were--
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.600]   That's a pretty good idea.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.440]   Instead of doing it out in the middle of the desert and in the middle of nowhere, you need
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.440]   some obstacles around.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.440]   So--
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.120]   And you need a few people out there.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.720]   And basically, they don't get hurt or injured while you're testing.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.720]   Yeah, but it's nice to have--
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:25.880]   And remember, the Phoenix, which is where most of these-- the Phoenix area where most
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:31.960]   of these companies have been testing it, Uber hit a pedestrian a few years ago.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.160]   So this is the first expansion of Waymo past the Phoenix metropolitan area.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.680]   What are how Waymo doesn't fog?
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.800]   Well, probably better than you do.
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.200]   People are totally fog.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.200]   But yeah.
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:48.760]   I'd always actually-- well, I'm trying to think, does it-- how much the laser would balance
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.440]   off of water particles?
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.440]   Hmm.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.600]   I don't know.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:59.760]   In Waymo's recent disengagement report, this is a report all self-driving companies put
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.520]   out-- disengagement means a safety driver had to take over.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.560]   And the DMV in California requires that they submit this every year.
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:16.960]   The company reported 21 disengagements over 629,000 miles of driving in California.
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.720]   That's a very good rate of 0.033 per 1,000 miles.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.560]   So you're in Waymo--
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.760]   Peace and light, Arab.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.360]   There's no driver.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.360]   And it disengages.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.400]   Does it like-- does it just stop on the side of the road and you're in the backseat and
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:32.400]   what happens?
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.400]   It pauses.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.800]   In fact, that's one of the things people in the Phoenix area kept complaining about
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:41.280]   with the Uber self-driving technology is there were a pain in the ass to drive behind.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:45.920]   Because it was like driving behind an extra cautious driver who just--
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.920]   Ram off.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.920]   --paused for everything.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.320]   And oh, I'm at a stop sign.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.820]   Oh.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:52.820]   They didn't like that.
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:58.200]   They would step on its speed around them honking, flipping them off, shooting--
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:01.800]   Hey, see, we were stepping over each other.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.800]   No, that's OK.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:09.240]   I was saying that LIDAR actually-- original LIDAR does not work well in fog, smoke, or
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.240]   snow.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240]   Ooh.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:16.240]   But there are advances in LIDAR that send out more pings and more directions and they
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.240]   do better.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.000]   Multie Echoe return LIDAR.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   I shall ask you.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   According to this article.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   Sam Aboule-Sam-Ed about this, Arab.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.600]   Yeah, this article is from 2016.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.560]   So let's take a little break.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.840]   More of the action coming up.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:36.720]   Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey and IOT.com, Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com, and from Hands-On
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.040]   Photography, our very own Ant-Puet.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.240]   Great to have you.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.800]   All three of you are showed today brought to you by privacy.com.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.880]   Whenever I use a credit card on the internet every single time for the last three or four
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:56.520]   years, I use a credit card generated just for that purpose by privacy.com.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:00.560]   By generating virtual numbers, privacy does a couple of things.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:07.800]   It masks your real bank information, so your privacy is protected, and it prevents fraud.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.600]   You could do two things with a privacy card.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.040]   You can make a burner card that can only be used once, can never be used again.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.040]   No problem handing that credit card over a number over to a merchant.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.040]   They're never going to be able to use it again.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.600]   Or you can create a credit card number that's tied to the merchant.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.500]   So I have one for Amazon, one for Audible, one for Target, one for everybody I buy from
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.760]   online.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:35.520]   And even if that number leaked out in a breach or was stolen, it could only, or used by some
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.960]   employee tried to use, it could only be used at that merchants.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.960]   And of course with privacy, you get a lot of reporting, including all the declines.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.080]   So the minute you see a card misused, you know it's been stolen.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.760]   You can pause it, delete it, create a new one.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.120]   It's the pausing feature is great.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:10:00.260]   I always use privacy.com cards to subscribe online, because you know how it is with subscriptions.
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:01.620]   You get charged every month.
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:05.220]   Sometimes you forget or they make it hard to cancel.
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.580]   I just look through my privacy cards and pause any card.
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.420]   I don't want to continue.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:10.420]   And they can't use it.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:12.940]   You can control your subscriptions and recurring payments.
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.220]   So you're never accidentally billed twice.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.940]   You never upgraded to another service without your consent.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:20.820]   You can also spend a set of spending limit with the service.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.300]   So you know, I know that subscriptions is $50 a year.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.660]   I could set it to $50.
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:26.620]   They can't overcharge you.
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:31.360]   And I wish I had this when I signed up for a gym membership about five years ago.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.620]   I canceled the gym membership, but they kept charging me for training for six months when
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:38.180]   I finally got around to calling the credit card company.
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:41.820]   They said, we can only turn it around for three months.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.620]   So you're out of luck.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:44.620]   Had I used privacy?
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.620]   No problem.
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.580]   I just paused the privacy card.
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.980]   No jumping through difficult customer service hoops.
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.700]   They just block the charges.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:55.940]   They'll also, of course, notify you if someone tries to charge over the allotted amount.
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:58.140]   So you always stay within your budget.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.140]   It's easy to use.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.700]   You can go to the web page, privacy.com.
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.060]   But there's also a Chrome and Firefox extension.
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.620]   There's an app for iOS and Android.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:11.060]   The Firefox and Chrome extensions will fill out the credit card information automatically
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.700]   with one click.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:15.140]   You can easily share cards.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:20.180]   I buy my mom dinner because she's 88 and I, she doesn't like to cook anymore.
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:26.940]   So I sent her a privacy.com card so she could use DoorDash whenever she wants.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.660]   It's tied to DoorDash on first use.
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:31.260]   The minute she uses it, it can only be used for DoorDash.
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:35.580]   And I didn't have to email it to her or send her a screenshot or a text message that she
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.940]   had to fill in.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.340]   I just clicked the share button.
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:42.660]   When I created the card, I entered the email address, privacy handled the rest.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.060]   You'll love the account summaries last year at tax time.
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:49.540]   It was very easy for me to put together all of my charges.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.540]   And by the way, it's nice.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.780]   You'll always know how much you've been spending any given month.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:55.220]   There's a summary page, good for budgeting.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:58.340]   It could filter by date by how much you've spent.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.540]   No need to guess where your money's going.
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:01.780]   So let me explain how this works.
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:04.300]   You tie it to your bank account or your debit card.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.380]   It's not a charge card.
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:08.580]   You don't run a balance, which frankly I kind of like.
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.980]   I just use it.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.140]   It gets debited out of my account.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.140]   That's that.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.900]   So it's kind of like writing a check.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:17.220]   But it's completely private.
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.500]   It's amazing.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:22.300]   So it's also preserves privacy.
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.220]   Protect your financial identity online.
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:28.900]   Protect your money online with virtualcards for privacy.com.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:31.100]   Go to privacy.com/twig.
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:34.700]   When you sign up for a new account, you'll automatically get $5 to spend on your first
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:36.060]   purchase.
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.060]   Privacy.com/twig.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.300]   There's a free tier.
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:41.620]   I actually just a little pro tip.
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:43.980]   There's three different tiers.
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:46.020]   I use the free tier for a long time.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:51.060]   And then I realized if I pay $10 a month for the next tier up, I get 1% cash back.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:54.660]   And given that I use privacy so much, I make money on that one easily.
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.660]   The $10 a month.
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:56.660]   What?
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:57.660]   You didn't know about this?
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:58.660]   No, I didn't know that.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.220]   Go look at the pricing page.
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:01.700]   Wait a minute.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:02.700]   That's a pro tip.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.300]   See, I'm telling you a little pro tip.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:08.860]   So the personal, which is probably all anybody needs is free.
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:12.940]   But I do the pro 10 bucks a month, but you get 1% cash back.
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:17.580]   And since I usually get 50 or 60 bucks a month back, that 10 bucks is--
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:18.860]   Oh my goodness.
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:24.300]   It's well spent.
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:31.140]   There's also a team's plan for people who have businesses and want to create cards for
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.660]   all their employees and that kind of thing.
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:37.180]   Privacy.com/twig.
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.940]   And I won't even charge you for the pro tip.
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:40.780]   You get $5 to spend on your first purchase.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:41.780]   Thank you, privacy.
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:45.780]   I've been using them for long before they started advertising for years.
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:47.820]   And I just think it's the absolute best way to go.
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:49.660]   Used to be credit cards.
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:50.740]   Discover used to do this.
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:51.700]   My amics used to do this.
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:54.380]   Will generate one time used numbers.
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:57.020]   They all stop doing that for some reason.
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:01.180]   But even then, the way privacy does it is 10 times better, in my opinion.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:04.820]   Privacy.com/twig.
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:06.500]   OK.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:11.740]   I promised Jeff I would never utter the word Facebook on this show.
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:12.740]   No.
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:18.820]   What you promised was you wouldn't beat me to try to piss me off.
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.820]   One man's bait is another man's poison.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:22.820]   Fine.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:24.900]   I'm fine to talk about Facebook.
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:29.940]   Facebook pulled the news feed out of Australia.
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.740]   Well, no, no, no.
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:34.380]   It pulled news out of the news feed.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.980]   You know, I misunderstood that.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:42.780]   They would be forced to pay for links to news.
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:50.500]   They said, OK, then neither news organizations nor users may link to news in Facebook.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:51.500]   And it already is happening.
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:52.500]   It'll put up blocks.
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.780]   I bet that makes Facebook better in Australia.
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:57.700]   I might move to Australia now.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:58.700]   Wow.
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:00.940]   So there's two interpretations I have, right?
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:06.100]   The nice interpretation is Facebook stood on principles in favor of the link.
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:08.460]   I could argue that for a while.
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:09.980]   Not very long, but a little while.
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:10.980]   The cynical--
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:11.980]   Wait a minute.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:13.180]   Stacy's eating waffles.
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.460]   That is not OK.
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:21.300]   Did you bring enough for the whole podcast?
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:23.900]   That was-- I muted my mic and everything.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:24.900]   Yeah, but I happened to look--
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:25.900]   Sweet or savory.
[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:26.900]   They look savory.
[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:27.900]   OK.
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:28.900]   They look good.
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:29.900]   I'm going to tell you.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:35.140]   So, I'm going to tell you how Belgian waffles with cinnamon on them are basically like funnel
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:38.100]   cakes, but better because they're not as greasy.
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.820]   They're freaking delicious.
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.820]   It's a swoop time.
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.820]   Everybody get them off or swoop.
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.380]   OK, go ahead, Jeff.
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:46.380]   Back to Facebook.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.380]   No, no, no.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:48.380]   This was a conspiracy.
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.380]   You said it's Stacy.
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:53.380]   Hey, just when Jeff starts going off, start eating the waffles.
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.140]   I can go to you and talk about the waffle.
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.140]   And then Jeff's off.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.140]   And that's that.
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.060]   We should have a little theme song.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:03.780]   Now is the time when we strip waffle on Twig.
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:04.780]   And we have a little song.
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:05.780]   We all have a strip waffle.
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:06.780]   What do you think?
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:07.780]   Waffle, dance.
[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:08.780]   That's my lovey-waffle.
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:10.780]   You can get waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle.
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.020]   Or you could hashtag waffle, hashtag because they're like--
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.580]   Yesterday was Shrove Tuesday, which was--
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:17.580]   Pancake Day.
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:18.580]   Pancake Day.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:19.580]   You know what?
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:20.580]   That's so cool.
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:21.580]   That's right.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.180]   And then that means the carnivalas.
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.180]   Next one.
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.180]   Not happening because--
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:26.180]   Today's Ash Wednesday, so.
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:27.180]   Oh.
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.180]   Oh.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:29.180]   Oh.
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:33.580]   Do you have to give up caramel waffles for a lint?
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:38.300]   I am not Catholic or a lint person, so I don't have to give up anything.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.300]   Waffle dance.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:42.140]   Waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle.
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.180]   OK, Jeff, go ahead.
[01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:49.540]   So you see, this is the problem with calling it the newsfeed.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:50.540]   That's what confused me.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:51.540]   Exactly.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.540]   I know.
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:53.540]   News of newspapers.
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.540]   News to you and your friends.
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.540]   It's family, but it's not news.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:58.540]   It's not news news.
[01:16:58.540 --> 01:16:59.540]   It's good, I think.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.540]   No, the news.
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:03.140]   I would like it if Facebook were just the family news.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:06.900]   So the cynical view is, all right, we're going to use this as an excuse.
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:10.980]   We're going to revert to parties and puppies and getting laid.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.540]   That's what Facebook started as.
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:13.820]   That's what it's back to.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:16.220]   Parties, puppies, and getting lucky.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.220]   And so--
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:19.060]   Screw the news.
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:21.020]   News is the hassle.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:22.820]   News is controversial.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:25.060]   News causes us to hire moderators.
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:26.060]   News gets us in trouble.
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.060]   So fine.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.340]   We're going to use little old Australia for a tiny little test.
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:33.860]   Brontog, baby, Brontog.
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:36.620]   That's the cynical view, right?
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:39.420]   And so, you know, I get it.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.740]   It's going to make me a nice Facebook.
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.020]   It makes for a nicer life for them.
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:50.180]   But when your uncle Joe comes in and has his disinformation, you know, if you just took
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:54.060]   hydroxychloric when you wouldn't need vaccines and you want to say no, Uncle Joe, let me
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.460]   show you this news story.
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:58.860]   Oh, oh, I can't do that, right?
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:17:59.860]   And so--
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:00.860]   Why not?
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.460]   Who knows what happens?
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:08.540]   So-- but won't this allow the likes of the news stations to thrive a little bit more because
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:12.980]   they'll be considered a little bit more reliable if you have to actually go there to get the
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:13.980]   news versus--
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.420]   Well, aren't you an optimist, Ant?
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:18.940]   Do you think people are going to go there?
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:21.340]   I saw an optimistic devil's advocate today.
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:22.340]   How about that?
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.580]   People who think they're wrong on the internet, they have time.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:31.180]   They will go and get the corresponding documentation to let you know, Uncle Joe, you're wrong.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:33.300]   And here's like six New York Times articles.
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:36.180]   Here's one from, you know, the Wall Street Journal.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:37.180]   Yeah.
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:40.900]   Believe me, they will let you know and they will go and get the information they need.
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:46.700]   So, Ant, to answer your question, a guy named Leonardo Puglisi, who's the founder of six
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:53.220]   news AU, an independent and unbiased news outlet in Australia, tweeted today, Facebook is actually
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:54.220]   banning news.
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.220]   I can't believe it.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.940]   That's pretty much a third of our viewers.
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:00.460]   If this applies to Instagram, we're really done for.
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:01.460]   Oh, bad.
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.500]   Because that's how they find their audience.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:07.580]   Go back to earlier discussion about Google, if I'm allowed to, where the value exchange
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.220]   here is the Google sends you audience.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:11.580]   It's not-- it's not Google uses your content.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.580]   Same for Facebook.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:16.060]   The value exchange is these places get audience because, oh, that's interesting.
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:18.180]   OK, I'll click and I'll go there.
[01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:23.100]   Remember, in a world where you're the destination, the New York Times had to reduce the number
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:28.220]   that defined you as a frequent user, wherein you would hit the paywall from like 10 pages
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:29.780]   a month to five.
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:35.900]   If you hit more than five pages a month, a month at the New York Affine Times, you were
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:38.380]   considered a frequent user.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:44.500]   So, no, I'm afraid your optimism is charming, but probably too optimistic.
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:45.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.500]   Wow.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:55.900]   He'll, by the way, he just said, OK, doesn't apply to Instagram, I think.
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:56.900]   Shoo.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:57.900]   Wow.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:06.420]   But, honestly, who's responsible for that situation?
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:12.700]   I mean, it's not Facebook's-- well, the situation that taking news out of the newsfeed hurts
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:13.700]   a publisher.
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:17.980]   It's not Facebook's responsibility to drive him traffic.
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:18.980]   Amen.
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:22.220]   That maybe shouldn't have built his business on Facebook.
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:23.220]   Amen.
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:25.460]   Well, but they got used this way by the act.
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:26.620]   Well, but here's the problem.
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:27.620]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:31.860]   We publishers also should have provided the mechanism for people to talk about the news
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:36.420]   and share it outside of horrible, poisoned comments sections we didn't care about.
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.300]   We should have created Next Door where you could meet your neighbors and talk about,
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:40.300]   you know, what's going on around.
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:41.300]   But we didn't.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:45.380]   So people went to Facebook and Twitter and Google with the news.
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:49.660]   And Facebook then, whether they wanted to or not-- I don't think they ever wanted to.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:55.060]   But they found themselves-- they had a role in the news ecosystem of society.
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:59.420]   And it is a question as to whether or not it's irresponsible to just drop that.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:00.620]   Now they've got a perfect excuse.
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:01.620]   Hey, we had to.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.220]   The Australian law.
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.780]   Right?
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:07.620]   Murdoch made us do it.
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:13.100]   But I heard from-- in each of these cases, I heard after the fact I got an email from
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:18.020]   PR people at each of the companies after they had done it, not before.
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:21.500]   And I exchanged with them on Facebook and kind of said, well, you know, I see two theories
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:22.500]   here.
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.500]   And they said, yeah, we're watching that.
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:26.180]   I don't think they know what to think inside Facebook either.
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:27.180]   It's a gutsy move.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:31.460]   I think there's also a way they separate themselves from Google.
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.460]   There's a pathologist--
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:37.220]   One of the options for these publishers now, though, with not having that vehicle.
[01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:39.900]   Market is betting a lot on marketing.
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.580]   A lot on marketing.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:42.820]   OK, but marketing where?
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:47.780]   Let's say this was supplied to Facebook and Twitter as well.
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:51.780]   So what's the vehicle?
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:57.900]   TV, billboards, all old mass media marketing mechanisms.
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:00.140]   That's when people demonize targeting, too.
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:03.940]   They say, hey, I found somebody in this neighborhood who's interested in sports, or interested
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:04.940]   in cameras.
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:07.460]   I can send them my camera section to this guy named Ant.
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:09.140]   Oh, no, can't do that.
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.140]   Right?
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:12.500]   So how the heck do they find you?
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.500]   Well, all right.
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:17.980]   Let me-- so this might lead into a more interesting area, which is--
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:19.380]   How do you find--
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:19.900]   How do you--
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:21.460]   Sorry, that wasn't interesting enough.
[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:23.580]   I have no-- believe me.
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:26.580]   Anything to do with Facebook, I'm not interested in.
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.900]   I think Facebook's a blight.
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.100]   No, I think it says what I'm talking about.
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:30.860]   I think it's a pathology.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:34.340]   Well, the reason you don't want me to talk about it is because every time I talk about
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:40.620]   I say what a pathological thing Facebook is, and it's a pathology on the part of the news
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:44.580]   media to depend on Facebook, I believe in the value--
[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.860]   But Ant's question is exactly right.
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:50.140]   How else-- this is where our media ecosystem is right now.
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:51.140]   How else do they do it?
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:52.140]   Well, so that's my question.
[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:53.860]   How do you-- OK, I don't use Facebook.
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:55.100]   So here's what I do.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.460]   You can build on-- oh, go on.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:58.460]   You're going to tell us.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:22:59.460]   Go ahead.
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:00.460]   Sorry.
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.460]   Here's what I do to get news.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:07.020]   I go-- every morning I go to Tech meme.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.020]   You.
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:11.180]   Now it's Tech news, but I'm sure other sites like this.
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:17.300]   And I also use a feed reader, an RSS reader, although I find Tech meme because it has editorial
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:22.500]   judgment, you know, a Gabriel Vera and team pick the top news stories.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:25.020]   Then I-- and it's all right here, by the way.
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:29.140]   And then I go to Nuzzle, which in the case of Nuzzle is actually--
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:30.620]   Wow, Twitter still.
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:33.660]   It's aggregating Twitter stories, but I don't have to see Twitter.
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:36.340]   I don't even have to see the tweets.
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:39.660]   I just see-- here, I'll quickly log in and through Twitter.
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:40.660]   See--
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:42.500]   The problem is you don't see what someone says about it.
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.860]   They could hate the thing they like to, or they could love the thing to it.
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:45.860]   No, that's not true.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:46.860]   You don't know what to do.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:47.860]   So actually, I take it back.
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.860]   So here's the story, which, by the way, number one story changes to sharing and viewing
[01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:52.940]   news on Facebook and Australia.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:57.500]   And it's-- what's nice is this link is to the-- directly to the Facebook post.
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.420]   And here's John Battelle's thought about it.
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:00.420]   Oh, OK.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.420]   Here's Kara Swisher's.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:05.860]   Here's Kevin Russe.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:09.980]   So these are-- this tends to be less tech, but this is a good source.
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:14.660]   It is-- I like it because it is pulling from Twitter, so it is crowdsourcing the stories.
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:18.460]   But I don't have to go to Twitter so much.
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.460]   Then I go to Reddit--
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.180]   But Twitter didn't exist.
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.180]   If Twitter didn't exist.
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.180]   Well, this is not Twitter.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.740]   So then I go to Reddit.
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:28.060]   And Reddit, of course, there's a lot of crap on Reddit.
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:33.580]   There's also-- you know, you choose what you see on Reddit because it's not algorithmic.
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:36.340]   It gives you exactly what was in that subreddit.
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:40.820]   So I choose the subreddits that I'm interested in, including, as you can see, the Mustang.
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:43.020]   Maki Yadera.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:45.420]   Anyway, and then-- so then I go to Reddit.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.900]   Then I go to another curated site that I really like.
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:56.820]   This is Y Combinators Hacker News, which is a place where geeks post stories they're interested
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:57.820]   in.
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:02.900]   And then it actually is really great because the comments are fantastically--
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:04.540]   Probably a lot smarter.
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:07.220]   Very, very smart comments.
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:13.100]   They have some of the Reddit/Twitter problem, which is the comments often-- the first few
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:17.020]   comments or the highest ranked comments, by the way, they're ranked, not chronological,
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:18.020]   are usually valuable.
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:21.940]   And then you get a little bit sometimes of insider talk.
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.020]   But I find this to be a really good source.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:28.380]   There's another one, and I wish I could get a membership to this, which is a Hacker News,
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:30.180]   but it's hard to get a membership.
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:35.540]   It's similar stories, but it's called Lobsters, L-O-B-S-T-E dot R-S.
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:38.060]   And it's also geeks stories.
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:43.980]   Then the final thing I do is also Crowdsource, which is the popular bookmarks on Pinboard.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:49.300]   So in other words, without a single stop at Facebook, I'm able to go-- and there's more,
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:53.580]   but this-- I don't want to go on and on, but I'm able to go to half a dozen sites and get
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:54.580]   a membership.
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:58.540]   And if I do this every morning and afternoon, which is pretty much what I do, I get all
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:01.140]   the stories that we're going to talk about.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:03.060]   This works pretty well for me.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:06.020]   And I don't need Facebook to do this.
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:08.340]   So I'm curious, Stacy, what do you do?
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:12.700]   I'm sure you do a similar beat check, or you must have in your news days.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.860]   Yes, yes.
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:15.860]   I have Nuzzl.
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:23.420]   I have-- I don't usually pop over to TechMe very often, but-- and then I use the financial
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:27.980]  -- actually, up until like two years ago, I used Yahoo Finance because it actually--
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:28.980]   You still use it.
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:30.980]   You still read that.
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:31.980]   Yeah.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.780]   Well, you can create your portfolio.
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:38.180]   So I just get news on all the publicly traded companies is just right there on one page.
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:39.180]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:40.180]   Yeah.
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:41.180]   It's actually-- it's pretty good.
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:42.180]   And Google has its own finance.
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:43.980]   And there are other pages like this.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:46.700]   Yeah, Google Finance is not as good from the news perspective.
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:50.140]   And it actually wasn't good for a while on the even financial stuff.
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.860]   I was like, oh, come on, Google.
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:55.900]   But this is a-- I think a really valuable way to get financial news.
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:57.460]   You cover that more than I do.
[01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:59.380]   Is there an IoT place you go?
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:02.900]   Oh, where are you kidding being sued for securities fraud?
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:03.900]   Wait a minute.
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:04.900]   Uh-oh.
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:05.900]   Uh-oh.
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:08.740]   Keith Gill, the guy on--
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:11.940]   I thought that hearing was tomorrow for him.
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:12.940]   Oh.
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:18.660]   Uh, Federal Court in Massachusetts, he's-- the suit said Gill-- oh, this is interesting-- was
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:25.300]   actually a licensed securities professional who manipulated the market to profit himself.
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.300]   What?
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:28.660]   A short seller acting unethically?
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:29.660]   What?
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:30.660]   Wow.
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:32.060]   So he was the face of the game's--
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.780]   Parrish, the font.
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:40.860]   And the guy on the subreddit, the stonks subreddit who got everybody to buy a game stuff.
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:41.860]   Interesting.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:42.860]   I could have sworn that hearing was tomorrow.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:44.580]   I didn't know it was today.
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:48.500]   Anyway, that's from Yahoo Finance.
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:49.860]   Do you do IoT?
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:53.020]   Is there any IoT sources you-- you must comb through those.
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:54.540]   There's a couple newsletters.
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:59.100]   But-- oh, and I also have a Google alert for various charts that are relevant.
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:00.740]   That's a good thing to do.
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.340]   There's not a lot of really awesome IoT sites.
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:09.260]   So yeah, it's about an hour of days combing through newsy things.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:13.820]   I pretty much spend most of my free hours not on the shows.
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:17.380]   You know, pretty periodically checking all of these sources.
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:23.340]   And there's a lot of-- and then I-- you know, this is by the way my news folder on Firefox.
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:27.740]   And I have Tech Dirt, of course, in the Guardian and Wall Street Journal Tech.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:33.380]   This is a great site, forecast.com with a K. This is a calendar of things like it says
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:34.380]   it's Ash Wednesday.
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.900]   It's also Kosovo Independence Day.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:40.020]   And Random Act of Kindness Day.
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:41.020]   So everybody--
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:42.020]   Awesome.
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:45.220]   Do a Random Act of Kindness.
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:48.500]   So I have a large folder with a lot of stuff.
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:52.900]   And not one of them is any way related to Facebook.
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:53.900]   And there's only--
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:57.420]   Well, what I was going to say is I was going to ask actually how you find your audience,
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:58.740]   not how you find your news.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:01.180]   Because that's what Jeff seems to be--
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:05.580]   Oh, well, that's what the publishers are worried about.
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:06.580]   So I'm a--
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:07.580]   I guess I'm a publisher.
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:10.020]   Yeah, I mean, Twitter's a publisher.
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:13.300]   I have a kind of unusual market-- go-to-market strategy.
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.980]   I let them find me.
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:18.060]   It's like I'm a terrible marketer.
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.220]   I am a terrible marketer.
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:22.700]   I just did our survey and like, hey, y'all, thanks.
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:27.180]   Like, 35% of my newsletter subscribers come from Twitter.
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:28.700]   Oh, you're very welcome.
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:29.700]   Yes, it's a twig.
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:30.700]   That's awesome.
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:31.700]   Sorry, twig.
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.700]   I should get the name right.
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.100]   Get a waffle for that one.
[01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:35.100]   That's good.
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.700]   Yeah, so I was like, oh, thanks, y'all.
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:38.700]   Nice.
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:39.700]   Like, all of y'all.
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:41.700]   That's awesome, yeah.
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:46.780]   But we actually did some advertising on Facebook
[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:47.980]   very early on.
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:51.740]   And we did find some interesting people.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:55.260]   But they didn't stick around.
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:59.100]   So it's just basically like a growth game
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:02.980]   through word of mouth and Twitter and being places, which
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:03.900]   is kind of sucky.
[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:06.140]   But it's kind of how you have to do it.
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:07.820]   We post on social media.
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:11.180]   We have a marketing team, Jerry and Masako.
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:12.380]   I am the marketing team.
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:14.940]   Yeah, they post on social media and stuff.
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.340]   We bought in the past.
[01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:18.940]   I don't know if we still do it, Google Ads.
[01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:21.620]   I never did that in the beginning.
[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:26.340]   The biggest audience we've had was all without any marketing.
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:33.620]   I guess in a way I got marketed by Tech TV for six years,
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:36.740]   and that was the marketing.
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:39.620]   You had a nice army from the get go.
[01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:40.140]   Yeah.
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:41.140]   Well, I brought them.
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:41.980]   Yeah, that's the key.
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:44.340]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:44.820]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:46.500]   And yeah, because I pulled a bunch of people
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.820]   from my giga home in Fortune Days,
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:50.980]   although some of those people are very confused
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:51.900]   by what they find.
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:52.660]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:54.100]   I thought you wrote about broadband.
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:56.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.260]   Sort of.
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:00.020]   My question, if you're looking at it
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:03.500]   as if this is going to happen next month,
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:07.940]   and we can't get our news from the social media platforms,
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:12.860]   how long is it going to take to train society to not go
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:14.580]   to those platforms to look for the news?
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:17.260]   Because there are people in this world, as you all know,
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:20.100]   that consider Facebook their internet.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.380]   I don't think those people will know--
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:23.300]   Or will they just see a lot less news?
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:25.180]   Yeah, I don't think they're going to go search it.
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:26.700]   You're the audience here.
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:28.140]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:28.820]   That's the point.
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:31.020]   So Facebook, when they reduced the news,
[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:33.700]   it was from like 5% to 4% when they got in trouble
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.980]   before because news was trouble.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:39.900]   And as I said, when they started NewsTab, where, by the way,
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:44.380]   before Facebook did pay News Corp for that already,
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:48.500]   about a year ago, more than a year ago, Zuckerberg on stage
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.020]   kind of said, we don't know if everybody's going to watch this.
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:54.820]   It's going to take a long time to go to NewsTab.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:57.620]   So they know that most of their--
[01:31:57.620 --> 01:31:58.500]   we're the odd ones.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.700]   We are the news whales.
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:00.940]   They call us.
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:01.780]   OK.
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:02.780]   There.
[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:03.780]   Not New Souths?
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:05.460]   We're the weird ones.
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:08.060]   No, news whales.
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.020]   I don't want to be a whale.
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:10.660]   Where's the rim shot on that one?
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:13.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:15.020]   You're a whale.
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:16.980]   How do you get news, Jeff?
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:20.260]   Do you-- you don't have to do what Stacy and I do,
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:22.540]   which is generate content every day.
[01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:24.220]   But do you have a news--
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:25.740]   Check.
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.900]   Yeah, I mean, I start with Twitter.
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:29.900]   I also go to my list.
[01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:30.820]   I have a COVID list.
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:34.740]   I have my Happy Place, which is my book History Wunks list.
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:36.060]   I have a Media Wunks list.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:36.740]   I use the list.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:38.340]   I use Twitter a lot.
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:41.740]   I go to Facebook, but not as much for news.
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:43.220]   But I see that first.
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:45.740]   And then I will end up looking down the New York Times page
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:47.020]   and the Washington Post page.
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:50.060]   So I do go to the destinations, which is what all news
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:51.540]   organizations want you to do.
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:54.740]   But that's a really odd behavior now.
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:55.980]   People don't go to the destinations.
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:57.580]   They end up going there with the links.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:59.380]   And then they'll find something more and more and more.
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:32:59.740]   I do.
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.740]   But I'll tell you, I find it--
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:07.420]   it's the same thing with Twitter, not as information rich
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:09.180]   as the sites that I mentioned.
[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:11.500]   So after I've done all that, I might
[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.660]   go look at the New York Times or the Washington Post
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:16.260]   or the information.
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:18.100]   But it's not as nutrient dense.
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:19.060]   Same thing with Twitter.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.180]   And I do the lists, too.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:21.740]   I have your COVID list.
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:22.460]   I use TweetTech.
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:23.540]   I have a COVID list.
[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:27.620]   I've got OAM's list of his top 25 tech reporters.
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:29.700]   I've got a larger tech journalist list
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:32.460]   that Robert Scobel created long ago.
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:33.340]   And so that's there.
[01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:34.300]   But it's not as rich.
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:35.660]   It's not as media.
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:38.100]   Well, the other thing I do is every Tuesday night
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:39.980]   and Wednesday morning, I spend a couple hours
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:41.460]   getting ready for the show.
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:41.980]   Thank you.
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:44.660]   I go and I go to--
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.060]   but here's the odd thing.
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:49.020]   Because Google News screwed this up a couple of years ago.
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.740]   I go Google thinks I'm an idiot.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.980]   Because I go to Google and I search for the word Google
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:57.100]   so I can then click on the News tab under that.
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:59.220]   Because going to Google News and searching for Google
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:00.420]   doesn't get me anything.
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:02.180]   Doing that gets me through Google.
[01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:02.860]   So I go through--
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:03.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:08.740]   --Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, and so on.
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:11.020]   Then I go to my newsletters that I like,
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:14.340]   my Benedict Evans, and I subject you to his essays,
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:16.100]   and as he's a czar and others.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:21.020]   And then I go to Axios pretty regularly
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:22.260]   and see what they have.
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:27.260]   And these are the ways that I feed into the rundown.
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:27.580]   Yeah.
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.940]   And that's what I use RSS for.
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:33.180]   Again, I'm really trying to not have
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:34.580]   to go to individual sites.
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:39.500]   I'm trying to get the kind of a nutrient-dense source
[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:40.140]   of information.
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:42.220]   So a news leader--
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.340]   this is InnoReader, which I use.
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:46.900]   So I have a Tech News section.
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:49.300]   But I also have a blogs section.
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:54.260]   And so this gives me a very quick scan of a lot of tech news.
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:57.500]   But by the time I get here, I've probably seen every story.
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:01.580]   I'm looking at this point for the offbeat stuff.
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:01.980]   Like--
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:03.580]   Yeah, by the time I go to New York Times,
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:06.460]   I've seen half of what I care about.
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:08.060]   Yeah.
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:12.940]   Like, for instance, the Charlotte Observer--
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:13.340]   I don't know.
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:13.820]   Oh boy.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.180]   How did you find this story, Jeff?
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:18.260]   Oh my gosh.
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:21.180]   It was my TikTok search on Google News.
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:22.220]   There you go.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:23.300]   Can't find Fettach--
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:24.940]   There's a Fettach shortage.
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:28.460]   Can't find Fettachese in Charlotte.
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:31.500]   And aren't you glad you moved?
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:34.620]   Boy, boy am I.
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:37.700]   Blame this TikTok trend.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:42.460]   Apparently, there is a TikTok trend for baked Fettach--
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:43.140]   Oh, it's a big deal.
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:43.740]   --pasta.
[01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:46.940]   It's probably on in South Park.
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:49.500]   Wait, what baked Fettachista?
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.140]   Yeah, you put in the tomato--
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:53.020]   cherry tomatoes.
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:54.180]   We salt and oil them.
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:55.020]   Oh, it's a Fettach.
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:56.940]   And we're making some macaroni.
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:59.740]   I like fresh basil and give it all a good mix.
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:02.580]   Then add some of that cooked pasta right on top
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:03.180]   and give everything--
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:04.180]   Well, that does look good.
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:04.780]   That does look good.
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:05.780]   I would eat that.
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:07.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:08.300]   OK.
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:10.700]   Well, good luck getting Fettach-- the Fetteverse.
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:11.220]   Wow.
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:13.020]   Fetteverse is out of Fettach.
[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:13.540]   Wow.
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:17.380]   According to the Washington Post, the baked Fettah pasta
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:21.900]   dish of first originated in Finland in 2018,
[01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:24.620]   the fresh market told Charlotte 5--
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:27.700]   your Channel 5 News in Charlotte--
[01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:30.380]   that since January 25th, it's Fettasales--
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:31.660]   Team coverage.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:39.060]   Team coverage of Fettasales increased by 45%.
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:40.460]   It's a Charlotte 5 hour--
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:41.940]   They target that market, though.
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:44.060]   They target that Charlotte market.
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:44.820]   So--
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:45.580]   Oh, no, I'm seeing.
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:48.020]   They target that demographic, the people that
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:50.620]   are in that TikTok-averse, if you will,
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:52.900]   are doing those types of stores.
[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.820]   The fresh market in Charlotte, obviously, is very hip,
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:59.500]   because they immediately made a video on Facebook.
[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.500]   Oh, boy.
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.100]   Of course.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:08.180]   On how to make baked fresh Fettah pasta.
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:10.820]   Washington Post says TikTok's viral big Fettah pasta
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:12.860]   is worth the hype.
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:14.780]   Oh, they put it a lot more garlic.
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:16.140]   Look at that.
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:17.100]   Oh, wow.
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:18.420]   Garlic makes it everything better.
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:19.580]   Ajita.
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:19.980]   You know what?
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:21.660]   I'm making this tonight, if I can find some.
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:23.300]   That does look good.
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:25.780]   I don't do the garlic like that, but that does look good.
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:28.820]   Cherry tomatoes right now, not in season, so--
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:29.300]   What else?
[01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:29.980]   What's next?
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:31.140]   What was that?
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:31.580]   That was--
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:33.020]   Oh, you're a psalmic winnigan.
[01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:34.500]   Oh!
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:35.500]   Bake 30 minutes until--
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:36.100]   Bake 30 minutes.
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.980]   This looks really good.
[01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:39.620]   Whoa.
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:40.820]   See, if you have more than a minute,
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:43.140]   you could put more ingredients in.
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:44.340]   And you smush it all up.
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:45.780]   They get a little fresh basil in there.
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:47.100]   The person's being very gentle.
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.660]   Yeah, they're smushing it.
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:51.740]   Now you put the macaroni.
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:52.740]   Or whatever, butts.
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:55.180]   Oh.
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:56.580]   That looks pretty good.
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.620]   Take that, Cacioe, Pepe.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:00.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:01.580]   That looks pretty good.
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:05.260]   It's kind of basically Greek macaroni and cheese, right?
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:06.740]   Yeah, I mean, there's tons of--
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:08.860]   I mean, we make something called stoplights spaghetti.
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:09.660]   There's lots of rest.
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:10.580]   It's basically this.
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:12.260]   Except we have to--
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:12.620]   Wait a minute.
[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:14.060]   I want to know about stoplights spaghetti.
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:15.420]   Stoplights spaghetti.
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:15.920]   That's all.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.740]   It's because we have green zucchini and yellow and red tomatoes.
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:21.100]   OK.
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:22.380]   And so it's stoplight.
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:27.260]   And then it's just garlic, olive oil, and basil, and pasta,
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:27.820]   and parm.
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:28.260]   No worries.
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.980]   You lost me at zucchini.
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:32.620]   You don't like the porch--
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:33.140]   I was out.
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.900]   --squash, eh?
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:37.580]   And I don't like squash at all.
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:38.080]   All right.
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:38.900]   No squashes?
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:39.420]   Really?
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:40.420]   None.
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:41.220]   No, Delilato.
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:41.720]   Delilato.
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:41.940]   I have those--
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:42.420]   --gettie.
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:43.620]   --scratch.
[01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:43.980]   This--
[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:45.020]   I'm going to ask the--
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:46.020]   Grilled squash.
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.380]   Grilled zucchini is OK.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:52.580]   You know, when Lisa makes her very famous ragu Bolonieze,
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:58.940]   her meat sauce, she'll also make Marcella Hazan's famous 45-minute pasta
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:02.100]   sauce marinara, which is very simple.
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:06.540]   Half an onion, stick a butter, can of San Marzano tomatoes.
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:09.100]   You just cook it for 45 minutes.
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:10.900]   It's fantastic marinara.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:13.460]   And we'll make zoodles, zucchini noodles.
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:14.740]   She likes her steamed.
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:15.820]   I like mine sauteed.
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:17.340]   So we split them in half.
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:19.740]   And then we put that-- and it's a delicious dish.
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:20.500]   You would love it, Aunt.
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:21.620]   You come on over.
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:23.700]   I'll give you the steak, and I'll have the noodles.
[01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:24.780]   No, Aunt, you don't--
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:25.060]   You don't want--
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:25.460]   You don't want--
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:26.500]   --better.
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:27.580]   Those are zoodles.
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:28.140]   Fried zucchini.
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:28.980]   Fried zucchini.
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:29.780]   Zoodles.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:30.140]   They're zoodles.
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:30.820]   They're zoodles.
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:31.700]   And I love zoodles.
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:32.700]   No, I know, I know, I know.
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:33.820]   Aunt, I got to pray.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:35.340]   Fried zucchini.
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:38.580]   Breaded fried zucchini is basically French fries.
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.220]   French fries with a vegetable--
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:42.060]   You know, are we talking about food again?
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:45.420]   Let's get to the changelog, man.
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:47.220]   I was actually-- I will, but I want
[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:50.620]   to talk real quickly with the journalists in the house
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:53.220]   about the super micro story.
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:56.220]   Remember, in 2018, October 2018, Bloomberg
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:40:02.180]   published a long, heavily anonymously sourced story
[01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:05.740]   about a supply chain attack apparently from China
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:08.500]   that involved taking super micro mother boards, which
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.620]   are on their way to the Department of Defense
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:13.420]   and many other places, including our studios.
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:16.900]   And embedding a--
[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:19.700]   They're so bored with what they find from you.
[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:20.220]   I know.
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:21.780]   They listened in and they said, what is this?
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:22.700]   He's talking about zoodles.
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:23.500]   Oh, what is this?
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:24.500]   They're talking about zoodles?
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:25.620]   They're going to set a cheese every week.
[01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:27.140]   I thought I don't get this.
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:29.140]   Do they have any good Chinese recipes?
[01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:31.660]   Anyway, they put a rice-sized grain--
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:32.780]   these are multilayered boards.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:36.020]   They could embed them almost invisibly on the board.
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:37.220]   Looks like a solder.
[01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:40.100]   And then it turns the computer into basically
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:42.300]   a spy machine for China.
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:45.860]   Two-- universally, Amazon, which makes the elemental systems
[01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:47.260]   that have the super microboard on it.
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:49.180]   And that's what we've got in our rack.
[01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:53.100]   Two Apple to everybody else that never happened.
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:54.660]   It's a BS story.
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:57.380]   Even security guru, Bruce Schneider, said, yeah,
[01:40:57.380 --> 01:40:59.660]   I don't think that happened.
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:03.940]   Well, Bloomberg on Friday doubled down
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:08.460]   with an even longer story, even better sourced,
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:09.540]   in which they said--
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:11.140]   Did it really though?
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:12.140]   Well, that's the question.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.740]   This is some squishy sourcing.
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:16.260]   And they didn't link to their original article.
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:19.180]   There's so many things in this article that feel like--
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:25.420]   I don't know how these guys sleep.
[01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:27.940]   I was sick to my stomach after the first story came out
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.180]   and everybody started saying, nope, nope.
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:33.300]   And I was like, oh my god, these poor reporters.
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:36.100]   But having gone this far without--
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:38.060]   and then doubling down on this with--
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:43.060]   knowing that their last story was so vilified, questioned,
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:45.300]   I don't know the right word I'm looking for here.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:49.660]   You would think they would do, after what, two years?
[01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:50.660]   Two and a half years?
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:51.780]   Three?
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:55.420]   They would have some proof, hardcore proof.
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:58.060]   And if you don't have proof, you don't come back to the table.
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:01.420]   I mean, this story is so confusing to me.
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:05.660]   The Bruce Schneider posted an article on his blog
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:09.060]   this week saying, I think I was wrong.
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:10.900]   This might be a legitimate story.
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:12.860]   Wow.
[01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:17.980]   But then others, including a security researcher
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:20.900]   with a bizarre Twitter handle, which I've forgotten,
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:22.900]   but said no.
[01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:24.900]   What does Steve say?
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:26.260]   Steve has not yet looked at this.
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:29.020]   He's not really an expert on this particular topic.
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:30.460]   So I'm not sure.
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:31.620]   Yeah.
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:35.220]   It's like hardware security, not necessarily.
[01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:41.020]   Well, it's also nation state spying hacking.
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:43.980]   Certainly, by the way, something that does happen.
[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:45.900]   Nobody's gain saying that this happens.
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:52.420]   In fact, we know the NSA has done it with Cisco systems on China.
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:57.140]   So we know we do it, and I'm not surprised to hear that China does it.
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:43:00.300]   I'm interested to hear your take on it, Stacey.
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.380]   They did add Lenovo to the Super Micro.
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:05.700]   In both cases, they said neither company is likely responsible.
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:12.860]   It's a supply chain attack as these gear makes its way to the end users.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:16.220]   They quote a lot of people.
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:22.220]   What some experts have said is they've misinterpreted the briefings that the intelligence community
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:23.220]   gave.
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:24.220]   I just think it's very interesting.
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:26.780]   They came back to the table.
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:28.540]   I think it's interesting.
[01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:35.860]   But I think I don't understand why they came back to the table with this.
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:40.060]   It's not like they're under time pressure, unless we're going to see some sort of news
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:41.060]   come out.
[01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:46.300]   The NSA is actually going to show us a board, and they wanted to be ahead of that story.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:48.940]   So that is something I'd look for, right?
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:54.060]   Actual physical proof that some government is going to unveil, which is why these guys
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:59.580]   pushed... I don't know.
[01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:02.100]   I'm trying to think of a good metaphor.
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:09.100]   It's a weak-sauce story from a sourcing perspective, from an even validation to their other one.
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:17.060]   Matt Tate, who is a former GCHQ consultant and now senior cybersecurity fell at the Robert
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:23.780]   S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law and uses the PONALV of things handle
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:26.820]   on Twitter.
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:31.780]   He essentially said, "As articles like this are constructed out of parts, there are a
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:37.900]   series of claims attributed to collections of sources grouped into an overall story."
[01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:44.180]   He says, "As far as he's concerned, it's a misunderstanding on the part of the sources
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:46.740]   on what they were told."
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:52.100]   I have to say, I feel like the Lady Doth protest too much.
[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:59.140]   I'm not sure why he's taking on such a strong position on this, when in fact there is absolutely
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:04.860]   no reason to doubt that this kind of thing happens, and supply chain attacks like this
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:13.380]   are among the most dangerous faced by intelligence agencies.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:16.180]   So maybe, I mean, I think I believe it.
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:17.660]   I'll be honest with you, I believe it at this point.
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:22.060]   I think there's enough information in this new story to make it credible.
[01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:24.100]   We know it happens anyway.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:30.540]   Why does he have such an interest in debunking this particular story when in fact this is
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:31.740]   something that happens all the time?
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:37.340]   And really the moral of the story, as I said two years ago, is beware of your supply chain.
[01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:38.340]   True.
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:42.220]   Well, it's a very difficult thing to do.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:44.780]   Look at the SolarWinds attack.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:49.220]   That worked because people trusted a security company called SolarWinds, and it was widely
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:53.340]   used, and in fact it was hackable and had been hacked.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:55.220]   That's another supply chain thing.
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:56.220]   I think the...
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:59.740]   I don't understand why Matt Tate is making such a big deal about this.
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:02.820]   I honestly feel like it's suspicious.
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:07.220]   He used to work with GCHQ, which was very much denial of this.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:13.740]   The first time around, that's the British government communications headquarters, their
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:16.180]   spy agency.
[01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:21.820]   I think there's a certain amount of vested interest among some intelligence agencies
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:23.860]   to say this doesn't happen.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.260]   When in fact we know it happens.
[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:27.100]   We know it happens.
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:33.460]   I guess maybe we'll wait to see if some other shoe drops soon.
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:44.180]   The accusations against Super Micro and the infiltration into Amazon and Apple are so inflammatory.
[01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:49.060]   They're very careful in this Bloomberg story to say we are not asserting that Super Micro
[01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:50.060]   is doing this.
[01:46:50.060 --> 01:47:00.460]   No, but it is a hugely damaging thing to say that your gear was targeted for this attack.
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:02.780]   It doesn't matter if they're at fault or not.
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:03.780]   If you're the...
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:10.980]   I was going to make an STD metaphor and I'm not going to do that.
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:11.980]   Moving right along.
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:15.860]   I don't have information to say it's true or not.
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:18.220]   I find it interesting that Bloomberg a year and a half...
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:19.940]   I told them two years later.
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:21.140]   Three years, yeah.
[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:27.180]   It was back again with a similar story and more information.
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:32.620]   Amazon denies, Apple denies, Super Micro denies.
[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:38.420]   Once again, if it were true, what's at risk, what's happened, what could be...
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:40.660]   Well, that's the start theory tomorrow.
[01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:43.500]   The real point is this is a very easy thing to do and it does happen.
[01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:48.100]   We do it and as presumed others are doing it to us and that's the real world.
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:50.340]   You can pull data off those servers.
[01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:53.780]   The idea is by putting this chip on, you can...
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:57.100]   Undetectably permanently hack these codes.
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:59.660]   Pull data off of anything off of that server.
[01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:00.660]   Yeah.
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:02.060]   It's not about hacking like ransomware.
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:04.900]   It's about hacking like espionage.
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:06.580]   It's espionage basically.
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:10.580]   Totally different.
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:15.220]   That's why I'm asking the journalists and the working journalists in a bunch.
[01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:17.700]   I don't have enough information to know whether it's true or not.
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:19.900]   This story has confused me from the beginning.
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:22.980]   I just...
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:26.060]   Based on everything they showed me, I still don't buy it.
[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:29.540]   And it's not just because people are like, "Nope."
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:33.660]   It's just looking at what they put in the story.
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:39.220]   It feels really confusingly incomplete.
[01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:40.140]   That's what I would say.
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:45.420]   They're not like they should have a motherboard or a hacked motherboard.
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:48.580]   They should have a hacked motherboard or they should have someone on the record who has
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:55.260]   seen and dissected who can say, "I held this thing in my hands and this is true."
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.260]   Right.
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:58.900]   Of course, you're right.
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:03.580]   To open it up again without that much of a leap, I think that's a good analysis.
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:10.740]   Or having real-named sources who are not just...
[01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:14.300]   The sources are like third degree sources.
[01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:17.220]   Yeah, they're third hand.
[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:19.580]   It's people who were briefed by intelligence agencies.
[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:24.020]   On the other hand, I wouldn't expect intelligence agencies to say anything.
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:25.980]   For one thing, one of the issues is...
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:28.380]   But where are the technologists, Leah?
[01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:34.020]   Like nobody who is in this industry, like I know the people who work at Super Micro.
[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:39.260]   You know the people, the sysadmins who are dealing with this at Apple.
[01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:45.420]   Those people would confirm or help this person find the story.
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:49.740]   You don't see them anywhere.
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:51.540]   Darren Mott, who oversaw counter...
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:52.540]   I'm quoting from the story.
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:57.540]   This oversaw counterintelligence investigations in the FBI's Huntsville, Alabama satellite
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:05.180]   office said, and this is the third hand, a well-placed FBI colleague described key details about
[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:09.100]   the added chips for him back in October 2018.
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:13.820]   "When I was told was there was an additional little component on the Super Micro motherboards
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:18.060]   that was not supposed to be there," said Mott, who has since retired.
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:20.940]   He emphasized the information was shared in an unclassified setting.
[01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:25.900]   Nobody would ever say it was classified because then they'd be prosecutable, obviously.
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:30.380]   The FBI knew the activity was being conducted by the China, knew it was concerning, and alerted
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:32.180]   certain entities about it.
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:35.060]   Mott said at the time he advised companies that had asked about the chips to take the
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:36.700]   issue seriously.
[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:39.340]   It's a lot of that.
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:46.580]   When those things come up, I sit with people all the time who tell me very juicy bits of
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:48.060]   information.
[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:52.260]   As a journalist, you run through and sometimes you hit a wall.
[01:50:52.260 --> 01:50:55.540]   Sometimes you cannot find the first hand person.
[01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:56.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:50:56.540 --> 01:51:02.380]   I wouldn't expect the intelligence community to leak on this.
[01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:10.820]   No, if you have the right sourcing, you should be able, they may not leak on the record for
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:17.740]   you, but they will point you in the right direction and help you get to the story.
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:22.100]   Read Lauren's writing about Syria, for example.
[01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:26.580]   They're playing a really good national security reporters.
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:34.900]   If you look at how they report, this story does not mean to meet the sourcing and the
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:37.620]   level of knowledge that those people have.
[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:40.580]   I think it's partially because, I don't know about these reporters.
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:42.380]   Are they national security reporters?
[01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:43.380]   Are they?
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:45.420]   No, no, they're longtime security reporters.
[01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:48.100]   Well, then maybe they don't.
[01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:52.140]   The other thing is maybe they don't understand what these people were talking about.
[01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:57.940]   Although I think that's probably bogus because it's not rocket science.
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:00.540]   It's just building a freaking server.
[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:06.220]   I feel like someone who can cover national security can learn enough about that to understand
[01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:08.460]   boards and components.
[01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:10.900]   Some people have said, "Ah, they don't really understand tech."
[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:16.940]   I'm like, "Guys, it's not that difficult."
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:22.100]   That's my question because I don't think we can decide whether it's technically feasible.
[01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:27.340]   It happens all the time whether this particular story is accurate, it's hard to determine.
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:28.340]   I'm more curious.
[01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:30.580]   Oh, and ScooterX is pointing out.
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:31.420]   This is actually true.
[01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:34.460]   I do remember this.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:39.020]   Some of the people after the first story, they came in and really did a lot of detailed
[01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:44.100]   searching for these devices and talked about how they did that.
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:47.340]   Presumably they did not find anything.
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:48.340]   Yeah.
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:51.180]   Well, including our father, Robert.
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:52.980]   Yeah, I just don't know.
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:56.740]   Anyway, it's interesting that I can ask you another question before you.
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:57.740]   Yeah.
[01:52:57.740 --> 01:52:59.980]   Bloomberg Business Week, which is a reliable journalist.
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:00.980]   It is.
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:04.020]   That's so weird.
[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:09.020]   They took a lot of heat back in October 2018 and the fact that they're willing to come
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:11.780]   back and do more with more information.
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:13.700]   They couldn't let it lay.
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:16.940]   Or is it lie?
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:18.140]   Yeah.
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:19.900]   What's your question, Jeff?
[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:23.660]   Just the nothing, the Seinfeld Company.
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:27.460]   One plus is co-founder of Foundry.
[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:33.340]   Carl Pei from One Plus started a company called Nothing Bought Andy Rubens, the IP from Andy
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:35.940]   Rubens failed essential phone.
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:36.940]   Yes.
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:40.820]   And it's by the way, probably a whole automation place as search stations.
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:42.260]   Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:43.260]   What is it?
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:46.020]   We're wondering what the heck this is going to be.
[01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:48.860]   Kevin and I almost put it on the show this week and I was like, "Ah, I'll just stick in
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:51.300]   the newsletter because we don't have enough details."
[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:53.900]   Remember that essential did that failed phone.
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:58.500]   But they also had, yeah, the smart home automation plan that was going to be intuitive
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:53:59.860]   smart home, right?
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:03.100]   But we never saw anything tied to that at all.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:04.100]   Right.
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:05.100]   So.
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:08.500]   Did he buy just the brand or did he buy technology?
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:10.500]   He bought all the intellectual property.
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:12.500]   Well, you didn't buy all the IP, okay.
[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:13.500]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:18.580]   Although I think there's some question about the patents, so I'm not sure what he got.
[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:21.140]   Speaking of unusual funding structure.
[01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:22.140]   Oh, is it?
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:23.140]   I do sign up now.
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:25.260]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why I'm bringing it up.
[01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:36.140]   So you sign up now and you can between 50 and 20,000 euro alongside Google Ventures
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:37.140]   for GV.
[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:38.820]   Oh, I think you're right.
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:44.180]   It says, Karl Pate tweeted, "We acquired essentials trademarks."
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.180]   Which is worthless.
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:46.180]   Yeah.
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:47.180]   You're right.
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.180]   They didn't get the team.
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:50.380]   Not if you're company is called nothing.
[01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:51.380]   Right.
[01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:52.380]   Now it's called something.
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:53.380]   Right.
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:54.380]   Thank you.
[01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:55.860]   Look at the team.
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:57.900]   Steve Huffman is still CEO of Reddit.
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:59.740]   He's on the team here.
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:00.740]   He is.
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:01.740]   Casey Neistat.
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:02.740]   Casey Neistat.
[01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:03.740]   Casey Neistat.
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:04.740]   What?
[01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:06.540]   Oh, this sound, you know.
[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:07.540]   I'm trying to.
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:10.220]   Karl was a good- That's why I'm trying to get my finger to the wind of my mouth.
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:13.700]   Marketer, more than I think, more than a technologist.
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:15.340]   Okay.
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:18.860]   He says, "We're building an ecosystem of smart devices.
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:21.820]   We'll start with simpler products, wireless earbuds.
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:23.420]   We're going to have multiple products throughout the year.
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:24.420]   Not just audio products.
[01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:27.660]   Eventually we want to build it so these devices talk to each other."
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:28.660]   Yeah.
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:31.100]   That's like, I mean, that's better.
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:34.740]   Does this put your interest or make you percure BS scale?
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:42.140]   Honestly, when he was CEO at OnePlus, they got a lot of heat for their marketing campaigns.
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:45.300]   They had that, you know, invite all weird way of selling phones.
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:46.300]   Yeah.
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:47.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:48.300]   They abandoned.
[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:49.300]   I fell for it.
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:50.300]   Yeah.
[01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:51.300]   I fell for it.
[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:52.300]   Eddie Rubens essential phone.
[01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:53.300]   There's that.
[01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:54.300]   One last story.
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:57.500]   I just wanted you to, I wanted your finger to the wind.
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:58.500]   Yeah.
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:55:59.500]   Yeah.
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:01.140]   One last story before we get to the changelog because that's next.
[01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:03.480]   There's so many stories we still have to cover.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:07.860]   But I should mention, we talked about this yesterday on Security Now.
[01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:09.620]   There is an Android app called Share It.
[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:11.220]   It's still on the Google Play Store.
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:18.180]   More than one billion downloads, one billion with a B downloads.
[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:24.500]   It contains vulnerabilities it has for the last three months the manufacturer has yet
[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:26.660]   to fix them.
[01:56:26.660 --> 01:56:33.980]   The bugs can be exploited according to a security analyst for Trend Micro to run malicious
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:39.340]   code on smartphones where the Share It app is installed.
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:41.940]   Wow.
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:47.860]   Using a man in the disk attacked, which is a kind of an insecure storage of sensitive
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:53.340]   app resources in a location in the phone storage space shared with other apps where they can
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:56.300]   be deleted, edited or replaced by hackers.
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:57:02.300]   Share It has not responded to a request from ZDNet.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:03.540]   It is still on the Play Store.
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:05.340]   Google hasn't pulled it down yet.
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:08.500]   Last time I checked.
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:11.660]   One billion downloads.
[01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:13.780]   You might want to take that off your Android phone.
[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:19.260]   That's one of many reasons why I'm not exactly an Android guy anymore.
[01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:23.020]   What I don't understand is this has a billion downloads.
[01:57:23.020 --> 01:57:27.220]   This is clearly on the Android radar.
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:29.980]   Google should know that.
[01:57:29.980 --> 01:57:35.220]   What's taking it so long to have this investigation escalated in a Google Play Store.
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:38.620]   Let me just check and see if it says, "Yeah, it's still on the store."
[01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:40.700]   What does it do?
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:48.100]   It's a way to transfer files from one platform to another.
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:50.460]   I think it's like a airdrop.
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:51.460]   Got it.
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:52.460]   I don't know.
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:55.220]   I've never installed it.
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:56.220]   Thank goodness.
[01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:57.220]   I know.
[01:57:57.220 --> 01:58:01.300]   I never installed it either.
[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:07.140]   Verizon's bid $6 billion to buy track phone.
[01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:14.740]   It bothers some people because that's the way that poor people get an expensive phone.
[01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:16.540]   I love this guy, Aaron Epstein.
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:20.860]   He bought a quarter-page ad in the Wall Street Journal, bitching about AT&T's poor.
[01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:22.020]   That was awesome.
[01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:24.740]   AT&T's poor internet service.
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:25.740]   He was getting three.
[01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:26.740]   Next day.
[01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:27.740]   Knock, knock, knock.
[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:28.740]   Hello.
[01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:29.740]   Verizon at the door.
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:30.740]   It was awesome.
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:34.420]   It's a lot of money, $10,000 to buy that quarter-page ad.
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:40.340]   I guess it worked an open letter to John T. Stanky, CEO AT&T, D. Mayor Stear, Mr. Stanky.
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:43.660]   AT&T prides itself as a leader in electronic communications.
[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:49.140]   Unfortunately for the people who live in North Hollywood, California, 91607, AT&T is
[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:52.140]   now a major disappointment.
[01:58:52.140 --> 01:58:55.220]   So AT&T responded, they gave them fiber.
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:59.260]   But apparently did not give the neighbors fiber, even though they implied that they
[01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:00.260]   didn't.
[01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:01.260]   Oh my gosh.
[01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:02.260]   That is so AT&T.
[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:03.260]   See, that's wrong.
[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:04.260]   That's a lot of longers.
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:08.260]   For $10,000, you could--
[01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:10.740]   They'll get to it by the end of the year.
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:12.540]   I think he must have had the $10,000.
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:17.580]   It was a principle because he also-- because AT&T was so terrible, bought cable internet
[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:22.260]   from Spectrum, which is also available.
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:25.580]   And so he now has a choice.
[01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:29.740]   They also said this is a headquarters of a lot of creative people in Hollywood and
[01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:30.740]   you're screwing this up.
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:31.740]   Right.
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:32.740]   Yeah.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:33.740]   Anyway, it's a--
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:36.740]   He should have taken to Twitter.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:38.740]   There'll be a movie.
[01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:40.740]   There'll be a movie.
[01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:41.740]   Mr. Epstein was--
[01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:42.900]   Was it Mike Harrington?
[01:59:42.900 --> 01:59:47.860]   Was it one of the early cases of using Twitter for customer service?
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:48.860]   I think it was Mike Harrington.
[01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:49.860]   Was it?
[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:50.860]   I think it might have been AT&T.
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:51.860]   I can't remember.
[01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:52.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:57.460]   And complaining that bull they were out there the next day.
[01:59:57.460 --> 02:00:00.460]   You know what I'd like to do next?
[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:01.460]   Besides--
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:02.460]   Edo Waffle?
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:06.060]   Before we eat the waffles, we're going to have to do your change look.
[02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:08.900]   But first, a word from Nureva.
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:14.580]   This is actually a great solution for classrooms, conference rooms anywhere.
[02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:20.420]   You have a number of people who have to keep socially distant but want to use Zoom or Google
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:25.260]   Meet or Cisco WebEx or some sort of conferencing software.
[02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:28.300]   The problem is they're all facing different ways.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:29.860]   They're all far away from the microphone.
[02:00:29.860 --> 02:00:31.060]   It just is a mess.
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:32.060]   It sounds terrible.
[02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:35.380]   Nureva sounds-- solves this with something I'm calling.
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:37.860]   They don't call it this, but I think it is.
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:39.340]   Computational audio.
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:46.380]   We've all heard about computational photography taking kind of a weak signal from a smartphone
[02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:48.900]   lens and turning into a beautiful image.
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:51.500]   That's what Nureva does with audio.
[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:57.300]   In fact, they have four patents for what they call their microphone mist technology.
[02:00:57.300 --> 02:00:59.420]   Now this isn't a beam forming microphone.
[02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:02.300]   If you've tried these, you know that they're complicated.
[02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:06.580]   They have to be set up and adjusted by a technician that costs a lot of money.
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:11.780]   We're not talking about a tabletop system and the mics required which have to be sanitized
[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:17.740]   between meetings and don't work with-- you have to put a sticker on the table and say,
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:19.580]   "Sit here, face this way."
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:21.300]   Not with Nureva.
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:22.300]   Not with Nureva.
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:26.820]   Nureva audio is designed for distancing.
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:30.500]   It's the first socially distanced mic system.
[02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:31.740]   They look like sound bars.
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:33.300]   You can mount them yourself on a wall.
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:34.820]   It's easy.
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:38.180]   Turn it on and the microphone mist technology takes over.
[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:42.140]   It fills the room with thousands of virtual microphones.
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:45.020]   You get full room coverage.
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:50.180]   People can be heard from anywhere no matter where they sit, where they face, or how they're
[02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:51.180]   distanced.
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:52.180]   No technicians.
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:53.180]   You can do it yourself.
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:57.020]   You can install each microphone and speaker bar right there on the wall.
[02:01:57.020 --> 02:02:01.020]   It automatically adapts to any room configuration which is great because it means you can move
[02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:02.100]   things around.
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:04.300]   You don't have to somehow calibrate it.
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:05.300]   It just knows.
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:09.700]   No wonder they've got four patents for their microphone mist technology.
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:13.780]   It named the top new technology at ISE 2020.
[02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:17.380]   That was the Nureva HDL 200 system.
[02:02:17.380 --> 02:02:20.860]   The HubSpot folks have an Nureva HDL 300 system.
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:25.160]   Jimmy Yann there, principal collaboration engineer says, "We were so impressed with the sound
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:28.700]   quality, the ease of install, and the ease of use of the HDL 300.
[02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:32.300]   It was a no-brainer for us to adopt it."
[02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:41.220]   Sound better with the magic of computational audio, the microphone mist technology.
[02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:43.140]   Very, very cool.
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:46.740]   If you're watching the video, you're seeing the images of the Nureva at work, but I want
[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:51.460]   you to, if you're not watching the video or just anyway, go to Nureva.com/twit.
[02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:52.460]   You'll see a demo.
[02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:53.940]   You'll see what it looks like.
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:56.020]   You could figure out which one's the right for you.
[02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:01.860]   It's an easy thing to install and boy, it makes a big difference in your space.
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:08.140]   N-U-R-E-V-A, Nureva.com/twit.
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:09.140]   Nureva.
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:13.340]   Thank you, Nureva, for supporting this week in Google.
[02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:16.340]   And thank you for supporting us by using that special.
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:17.660]   You are, although no, you heard it here.
[02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:21.620]   If you go to Nureva.com/twit and you are E-V-A.
[02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:24.820]   There's a lot of stories.
[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:27.620]   Let me get the change log because it's a big long change log.
[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:28.740]   It's time for...
[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:29.740]   Guess not.
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:34.100]   Guess it's not the time for it.
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:35.100]   Cricket.
[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:36.100]   It's time for it.
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:37.100]   Waffle time.
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:39.100]   Waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle.
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:42.460]   It's time for finding that button.
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:43.460]   Where did it go?
[02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:45.260]   Want me to do it again?
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:48.740]   Well, they say it in there.
[02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:49.740]   That's why.
[02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:53.220]   It's time for the Google change log.
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:55.220]   Google change log.
[02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:58.420]   So funny here, Jimmerby in the background.
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:03:59.420]   He was waiting for me to find out.
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:01.620]   He kind of artist blames his tools.
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:05.100]   He was blaming me for not saying the Google change log.
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:08.660]   But it says it there, so I thought it's time for...
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:11.020]   And then he was going to go to Google change log.
[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:13.340]   I'm on Team Jimmerby on this one.
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:14.340]   Okay, my fault.
[02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:15.340]   That's his cue.
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:16.340]   That's his cue.
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:17.340]   That's his cue.
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:19.060]   And he's sticking with it.
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:20.060]   Yeah.
[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:23.980]   Actually, the truth is the trumpet guys were all having a cigarette break.
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:25.900]   We had to get them to rush back.
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:26.900]   It's smokey.
[02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:28.540]   I'm admiring your car.
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:29.540]   Yeah.
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:31.860]   I can't wait to get into it.
[02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:38.660]   A new video at our Plus Enhanced Editing Features in the Google Photos app.
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:39.660]   This is great.
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:47.260]   This is the one that was on the Pixel and is now available to all Google One members, right?
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:49.580]   You have to have a Google One account.
[02:04:49.580 --> 02:04:50.580]   Right.
[02:04:50.580 --> 02:04:55.660]   I do enjoy being able to have the simple video editing capability.
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:05:00.620]   It's just a trim and stuff like that for people trying to put things on social just for quick
[02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:06.460]   marketing and without having to go through the likes of a power director or Adobe Rush.
[02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:07.660]   It's got some other things though.
[02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:08.660]   It's got stabilization.
[02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:09.660]   Yeah.
[02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:12.020]   You can rotate your videos.
[02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:16.940]   You can crop, change perspective, add filters, granular edits, including brightness, contrast
[02:05:16.940 --> 02:05:21.740]   saturation and warmth and now 30 controls.
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:23.820]   So there's quite a bit you can do.
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:24.820]   Yeah.
[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:26.660]   And you don't have to leave Google Photos.
[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:27.660]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:28.660]   I started playing with this.
[02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:30.420]   It's out now, right?
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:31.420]   Yeah.
[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:32.420]   I thought the other thing was--
[02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:35.140]   I thought we talked about this last week, but I guess this is more.
[02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:36.140]   No.
[02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:37.140]   No, sir.
[02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:38.140]   I'm so confused.
[02:05:38.140 --> 02:05:42.420]   The new video editing features are already available in Google Photos and iOS.
[02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:46.100]   We'll be rolling out to Android users in the coming months.
[02:05:46.100 --> 02:05:47.100]   Oh, here's--
[02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:48.100]   Oh, no.
[02:05:48.100 --> 02:05:49.100]   Then I don't have it.
[02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:50.100]   Oh, well--
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:51.100]   What's I using?
[02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:52.100]   There you are.
[02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:53.100]   I don't know.
[02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:57.300]   And then I did mention last week the new features with the Google One membership, which
[02:05:57.300 --> 02:06:02.220]   include Blur Portrait Light Color Pop and the like.
[02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:04.940]   Google-- no, that's the same story.
[02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:05.940]   Again.
[02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:13.220]   Google TV will add 4K streaming and more simultaneous streams, but you're going to have to pay.
[02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:14.220]   Mm.
[02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:15.220]   Going to have to pay.
[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:19.300]   Who's going to pay the content guy?
[02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:21.100]   Or do you have to pay to get it?
[02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:27.100]   It's actually time I look at YouTube TV again because football season is over, so I'm not
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:33.140]   watching any live sports and don't have to-- don't feel the need to pay for live TV.
[02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:38.380]   And I just changed my Hulu package, but it's probably time to look back at YouTube TV and
[02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:39.940]   do another comparison.
[02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:45.900]   But I still remember hating the history button on there that showed up on my regular YouTube
[02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:48.740]   views from my TV YouTube.
[02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:55.700]   This is really more for kind of, I would say, the future.
[02:06:55.700 --> 02:07:02.060]   But 4K-- OK, YouTube is long invested in latest visual technologies.
[02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:07.900]   We now support SDHD 4K, VR, HDR and live video on nearly every device within the internet
[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:08.900]   connection.
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:09.900]   It's mind-boggling.
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:13.540]   Ooh, from desktops to mobile and gaming consoles to VR headsets.
[02:07:13.540 --> 02:07:14.540]   Wow.
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:19.900]   Later this year, we'll redesign the YouTube VR app homepage to provide navigation accessibility
[02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:23.660]   and search functionality.
[02:07:23.660 --> 02:07:26.020]   They're really-- that's good.
[02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:27.320]   They're busy.
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:33.120]   There aren't a lot of broadcast streams in 4K, but if you-- if there are one, YouTube
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:39.980]   TV will be adding support for 4K streaming, which would be nice.
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:44.280]   And they'll be-- this is an add-on package, so yeah, you're going to pay for it.
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:49.400]   The new add-on bundle will also enable offline downloads of recordings on YouTube TV.
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:54.400]   Oh, because you have a DVR, so now you'll be able to download what you've DVR'd and
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:58.400]   take it on the plane with you or whatever.
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:01.760]   And finally, this add-on package will also give families the ability to use YouTube TV
[02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:03.520]   on more devices at once.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:07.920]   Right now, you're limited to three devices at a time.
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:13.560]   And if a fourth one gets on, it kicks off one of the previous viewers.
[02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:14.560]   It's kind of--
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:15.560]   How convenient.
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:18.360]   Yeah, a little Russian roulette.
[02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:20.520]   So it's not-- there's no price.
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:25.200]   We're already paying $65, $65 a month for YouTube TV.
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:27.560]   That's what cable bill used to be.
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:28.560]   Exactly.
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:29.560]   So frustrating.
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:36.320]   50, count on 50 updates for classroom, meet and other online education tools.
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:39.320]   I'm not going to tell you all 50 of them.
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:40.320]   What are you crazy?
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:42.320]   What are you--
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:43.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:44.320]   Waffle time.
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:45.320]   Waffle, waffle, waffle.
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:46.320]   Later this year, blah, blah, blah.
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:47.320]   I'm not going to read all of those.
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:52.320]   There's a lot of them.
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:56.960]   If you're using Google Classroom, meet and education, read about it.
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:00.960]   Material design is coming to the web with a WordPress plugin.
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:01.960]   OK.
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:02.960]   OK.
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:03.960]   OK.
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:12.760]   So if you're using WordPress and you want to be material, you want to be material.
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:13.760]   You can do it.
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:17.280]   Google Maps will now let you pay for public transportation and parking in the area.
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:18.280]   The app.
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:21.920]   That's not-- it's really annoying when you get to a meter and you have to download the
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:26.560]   app for that little town's meter system or whatever.
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:27.560]   So--
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:29.720]   That is very cool to see.
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:30.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:36.200]   This will require obviously the cooperation of the parking folks in your place.
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:38.080]   But you tap on pay for parking.
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:40.480]   It's a button that appears as you near your destination.
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:43.560]   Enter your meter number, the amount of time, and tap pay.
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:44.840]   It goes right through Google Pay.
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:47.200]   It'll be built into Google Maps.
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:52.360]   400 plus cities, including Boston, Cincinnati, Houston, LA, New York, Washington, D.C.
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:56.600]   And more Android users will get the feature first.
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:57.600]   No Petaloma?
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:00.280]   Don't see Petaloma on the list.
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:01.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:06.000]   Dang, now, but you can also buy train tickets or transit tickets.
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000]   That's cool.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.160]   Are there buses in Petaloma?
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:10.160]   Yes.
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:11.160]   Yes, they are.
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:14.800]   They are natural gas buses.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:19.760]   And we also have a smart train at Light Rail that goes from here to nowhere, which is great.
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:20.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:21.760]   The train is fast.
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:22.760]   That's not exactly nowhere.
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:23.760]   San Rafael.
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:25.200]   It's not exactly somewhere either.
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:26.200]   It is fast.
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:27.200]   It's nice.
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:28.200]   That train is fast.
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:31.160]   If you're going to San Rafael, it's great.
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:33.800]   Don't go, but it'll also go to Santa Rosa.
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.080]   It goes right next to our favorite stake place in Santa Rosa.
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:38.640]   But the train stopped running at 6 p.m.
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:40.040]   So you're going to get stranded.
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:41.240]   What's the stake place?
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:43.440]   I hate to do your rail, but I had to ask.
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:44.440]   Oh.
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:45.880]   We can't take you there.
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:48.160]   But someday, we'll take it as Starks.
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:49.160]   Starks?
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:50.160]   OK, yeah, I've heard of Starks.
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:51.160]   OK.
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:52.160]   San Rafael, yeah.
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.160]   I've heard about Starks.
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:54.720]   OK, we're going back to the food thing again.
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:55.720]   I wish we were doing it.
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:56.720]   Oh, sorry.
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:57.720]   But it's good.
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:10:58.720]   Sorry, yeah.
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:03.160]   They have, besides an amazing porterhouse, lovely lobster, the porterhouse, the guy comes
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:07.000]   out and it's like for family of eight and covers it up for you.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:13.800]   But they also, the bread comes in a frying pan in which it has been baked with butter
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:15.720]   and garlic.
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:18.160]   And it's a pull apart roll.
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:21.320]   And you might as well just eat that and not buy any steak.
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:22.320]   Mm.
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:23.320]   Because it's good.
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:25.800]   And I always say, I'm not going to have any of the bread.
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:27.600]   And I always do.
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:29.440]   Sorry for derailing.
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:34.720]   Google Play Store can now share apps and updates with nearby devices.
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:39.240]   Google Play Store can now share apps and updates with nearby devices.
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:41.440]   Another kind of like AirPlay thing.
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:45.080]   This is the nearby sharing feature which Google has talked about before.
[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:47.120]   It's going to start.
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:53.260]   Open the Play Store, tap the three line menu button, aka the hamburger menu in the top
[02:11:53.260 --> 02:11:55.440]   corner of the tap My Apps and Games on this page.
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:59.520]   You see a handful of tabs along the top, one of which should say share.
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:02.240]   If you don't see the share tab, try waiting a few minutes.
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:04.440]   OK, OK.
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:05.440]   Fine.
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:06.440]   Fine.
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:11.240]   Why isn't it a pancake menu?
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:13.840]   Could be pancakes, could be three pancakes, could be--
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:15.680]   Who decided it was going to be a hamburger?
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:16.920]   Three silver dollars.
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:18.920]   I don't know.
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:23.920]   Oh, well, because a hamburger has a pancake menu--
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:25.520]   It's not even that.
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:26.680]   OK, yeah, I don't know.
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:29.400]   The hamburger is narrower than the buns.
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:32.360]   I was waiting to see how she justified it.
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:37.320]   I was like, you don't always get three pancakes in a stack.
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:39.480]   But you got three things in the hamburger.
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:40.880]   It's not a waffle menu.
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:42.680]   Three waffles would be a little too much.
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:44.680]   That's a lot of waffles.
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:47.600]   You made me get up in the middle of the show
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:50.280]   and go into the kitchen to see if any street waffles were left.
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:52.160]   But there were all street waffles.
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:54.680]   To be clear, I was not eating a street waffle.
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:56.760]   No, but I made me want a street waffle.
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:00.520]   You put it top of mine, though.
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:02.600]   Fitbit smartwatches and trackers are now
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:10.160]   sold in the Google Store, because Fitbit is now owned by the Google.
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:11.640]   So, yay.
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:16.240]   Is there still a sense of upset over Google's acquisition
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:18.200]   of Fitbit?
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:21.560]   I'm sure some people are upset over it.
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:24.520]   I get mostly the impression no one really cares anymore.
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:25.040]   But it cares.
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:28.360]   Well, because-- I mean, look, Facebook's doing a smartwatch now.
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:30.120]   We've got Amazon's got a smartwatch.
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:30.620]   Yeah.
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:31.240]   Apple's got this one.
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:32.040]   Amazon's got this one.
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.440]   Amazon's got a little bother with a watch.
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:35.880]   They just put a tracker--
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:38.000]   They just went straight to weird surveillance
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:43.000]   and emotional blackmail on your wrist.
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.560]   You sound angry.
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:45.560]   I also--
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:45.560]   I have to--
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:46.320]   --you're fat.
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:52.080]   I have to say, the new Amaki has wireless airplay.
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:55.480]   So I just get in the car and my airplay starts.
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:56.880]   There is a bug, apparently, which
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:58.440]   causes a boot loop with Android 11.
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:00.400]   I haven't tested that yet.
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:04.400]   But I might want to see if I can use my Android auto,
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:10.200]   because you can now create custom Google Assistant shortcuts.
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:12.080]   So you don't even have to talk to the damn thing.
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:13.920]   You just tap a button.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:16.120]   And here's one for closing the garage.
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:18.200]   Here's one for arming the house.
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.160]   And I would guess others could be make a phone call or navigate
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:23.760]   home, that kind of thing.
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:24.360]   Custom buttons.
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:26.680]   I wonder if this was discussed on Smart Tech today
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:28.560]   with Mr. Casanelli.
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.080]   He's all into short cuts.
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:31.560]   Yeah, he loves them on iOS.
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:33.200]   Yeah.
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:34.520]   Yeah.
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:40.840]   Google Assistant unofficially comes to Windows and Mac OS
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:42.600]   with a custom client.
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:44.240]   What?
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:48.200]   Melvin Abraham has written this custom client.
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:48.840]   It's on GitHub.
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:50.360]   So this isn't really part of the change
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:52.880]   log, because it's not from Google.
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:55.680]   But boy, you might want to check that out.
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:58.120]   It's GitHub.
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:00.760]   Melvin Dash Abraham.
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:05.920]   The Google Assistant unofficial desktop client.
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:09.920]   And by the way, Jeff Jarvis, it comes in dark mode.
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:10.520]   Yes.
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:11.120]   No.
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:12.240]   Yes.
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:12.760]   No.
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:13.960]   Yes.
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:17.440]   Finally, the last story.
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:22.240]   [BEEPING]
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:23.960]   I can't even parse this sentence.
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:28.840]   Google prompt 2FA UI on Android gets much needed dark theme.
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:31.360]   Oh, your prompt for two factor authentication
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:33.320]   is now in dark.
[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:34.920]   Dark?
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:35.440]   Dark mode.
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:36.880]   Dark mode?
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:37.840]   They had to do--
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:38.680]   No.
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:39.160]   No.
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:44.120]   And that's the Google change log.
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:44.620]   Yeah.
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:46.680]   [SINGING]
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:50.560]   [SINGING]
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:53.760]   Parlors back, but none of the parlays are there.
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:16:01.640]   So I had to invent all new parlays.
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:02.960]   But I did log in, and it's back.
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:05.320]   I don't know who's hosting them now.
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:08.840]   So was thinking that one woman who downloaded everything?
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:09.440]   Yeah.
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:12.760]   All the old parlays are somewhere else's servers.
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:14.560]   They're not on parlays servers.
[02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:16.560]   All right.
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:17.800]   Sky silk.
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:19.000]   Sky silk.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.000]   Are they Russian?
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.280]   All right.
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:23.440]   Are they Russian sky silk?
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:24.640]   LA based sky silk.
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:25.160]   LA based.
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:26.160]   Good.
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:27.400]   Good, good, good.
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:30.400]   Professional cloud hosting services.
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:34.640]   Now it's time for the loveless Stacey Higginbotham's
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:35.720]   war awful.
[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:39.560]   You should do this, the waffle of the week.
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:41.200]   Wouldn't that be good?
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:46.160]   Today's waffle combines savory feta cheese
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:49.840]   with honey from the South Carolina Hill country.
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:50.840]   Oh.
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:52.920]   I'd have a waistline of the century.
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:55.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:57.440]   It's a big grit waffles once.
[02:16:57.440 --> 02:16:59.520]   That sounds terrible, but they were very good.
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:00.280]   Out of the--
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:00.960]   Harmony grits?
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:01.480]   Grits.
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:02.480]   Yeah, how many grits.
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:04.320]   And you pop that in your waffle dough,
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:06.720]   and it makes like a cornmeal waffle kind of.
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:09.600]   Oh, the whole grit, not the little ground up grits,
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:11.080]   but the whole harmony.
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:12.080]   Not that that's--
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:13.080]   No, no, no, the little ground up--
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:14.080]   Oh, the little ones.
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:14.920]   Not the big honka-hup.
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:15.760]   Not the honka-hup.
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:16.280]   That's like console-y.
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:19.080]   Yeah, honka-hup-hup-hoon-homin-y.
[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:21.640]   OK, so today's today is not a thing.
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:22.560]   It's an app.
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:22.840]   Yes.
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:26.800]   Because I am very excited about mountains.
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:28.920]   I think it's very important for y'all to know that,
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:31.200]   because otherwise this makes no sense.
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:36.120]   You know, though, I hear there ain't no mountain high enough.
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:38.760]   We're a valley low enough.
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:40.760]   So this app is called--
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:41.960]   Where is it?
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:43.480]   Peak Finder.
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:44.840]   This is not going to be good for you
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:46.400]   if you don't live near mountains.
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:48.720]   But if you like to visit places with mountains, it's great.
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:49.640]   It does cost money.
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:50.640]   It costs $4.99.
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:53.480]   But I found it very worth it, because I am constantly
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:55.960]   looking like when I'm on hikes or just--
[02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:57.520]   you know, there's a lot of mountains around me,
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:17:58.200]   and it's beautiful.
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:00.680]   And I'm like, man, is that mountain baker?
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:01.840]   I don't know.
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:05.720]   And now I know, because I downloaded this app,
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:07.440]   and it uses your location.
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:10.080]   You just scan, you turn it, you open the app,
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:12.960]   and you see camera basically, and you scan,
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:15.000]   and you're like, and it just shows you little tags
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000]   for every single mountain.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.960]   It tells you what they are.
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:20.440]   And you can take pictures and stuff like this.
[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:22.080]   Again, this is a very niche app.
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:23.200]   I'm not going to lie.
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:25.160]   But it works so well.
[02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:26.040]   It does such a great job.
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:27.880]   And even when you can't see the mountains,
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:28.880]   it knows where you are.
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:30.640]   And it will tell you the mountains that
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:32.480]   are behind that bank of fog.
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:34.880]   It's very exciting.
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:36.880]   Wow, that's cool.
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:38.920]   It's super cool.
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:43.600]   And I don't-- maybe I think that might be weird,
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:44.960]   but that's OK.
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:47.000]   No, what makes you think that?
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000]   You're weird.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.080]   You can also take pictures and share
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:53.280]   the pictures with the names of the mountains on them,
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:56.880]   so you can be like, aha, friends, look at me.
[02:18:56.880 --> 02:18:58.760]   And it even works offline.
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:01.400]   So when you're hiking and there's nobody near you,
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:04.600]   all the data is down there in your geographic area where you
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:07.760]   are, and it will still tell you.
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:08.640]   So that's it.
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:09.880]   That's pretty cool.
[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:11.760]   I want to get-- we talked about news gathering.
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:14.200]   And I think one-- I left out one of the steps that I think
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:15.560]   is really important.
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:19.080]   I use a bookmark tool whenever I'm reading a story
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:23.520]   to bookmark it so that there is a central place where people
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:25.120]   can--
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:29.080]   our producers can find the stories I'm interested in covering.
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:31.840]   I have it automatically set up with Zapify
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:33.960]   to populate a spreadsheet for them,
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:35.440]   makes it easier for them to work.
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:38.400]   And I want to give a plug to this because I've
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:39.720]   been using it for some time.
[02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:43.880]   It's called Pinboard at pinboard.in.
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:47.240]   I started using it when Delicious was acquired by Yahoo
[02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:49.680]   and started to fall apart.
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:50.120]   It was--
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:50.560]   It was years ago.
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:54.400]   Yeah, years ago, it supported the Delicious API.
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:56.720]   So it worked with a lot of tools I use.
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:58.360]   It's just been rock solid.
[02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:02.800]   And at the time, the creator, Meche Chaglowski--
[02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:03.300]   What was that?
[02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:04.520]   How you say his name?
[02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:05.760]   That's how I say his name.
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:07.680]   Say it again.
[02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:08.600]   I may be wrong.
[02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:14.120]   Meche M-A-H-T-H-A-Y, Meche, which
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:17.960]   is a archaic Polish form of the word Matthew.
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:21.880]   And I'm guessing Chaglowski or Chaglowski.
[02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:25.240]   Anyway, he's a really cool startup guy.
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:27.400]   He founded Pinboard many years ago.
[02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:28.680]   And he did an interesting thing.
[02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:33.800]   He said, the sooner you buy in, you'll get a lifetime
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:34.920]   membership.
[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:37.600]   And the price will go up as more people use it.
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:38.600]   So it was kind of incentive.
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:42.800]   And I think I spent $12 literally 10 years ago.
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:45.160]   I got an email from Meche.
[02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:49.440]   And I'm sure a lot of us old timers did say, way back when
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:50.640]   you paid me $12.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:51.800]   And thank you.
[02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:54.360]   But it's still cost being running to run this.
[02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:58.640]   And you don't have to, but it'd be nice if you subscribe.
[02:20:58.640 --> 02:21:00.760]   And he gave me a lot of different levels.
[02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:03.600]   I actually chose the donut level.
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:06.640]   So you could see next to my name, there is a donut now.
[02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:07.640]   That means I am.
[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:08.480]   I'm standing.
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:09.480]   Yeah.
[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:10.000]   Yeah.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.080]   Oh, he clicked the donut.
[02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:11.920]   Nothing happens.
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:15.960]   But I was hoping I'd get a donut anyway.
[02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:18.720]   But I just wanted to not only mention it, but also encourage
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:21.560]   those of you who, like me, were early pioneers and signed on
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:23.040]   early to this.
[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:26.680]   You look for your email from Meche and who is a great guy,
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:28.600]   anyway, his blog, Idle Words.
[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:31.480]   He's fantastic.
[02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:34.880]   He's been writing a lot about Hong Kong.
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:36.520]   The Hong Kong protests.
[02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:40.760]   Hasn't written since October, probably doing other things.
[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:42.640]   But still, he says, I want to--
[02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:44.120]   Super active on Twitter.
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:44.960]   Yeah, he's great.
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:46.440]   He's just really great.
[02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:49.120]   I wouldn't know that because I don't follow him.
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:52.520]   He runs a state of alternative candidates.
[02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:55.760]   So you can donate to-- he researches political candidates,
[02:21:55.760 --> 02:21:56.320]   actually.
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:21:58.440]   And so he does quite a bit.
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:21:58.800]   Sorry.
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:02.440]   We've asked him to be on many times because I love what he
[02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:03.800]   says in Idle Words' blog.
[02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:05.120]   And I think the world of him.
[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:07.840]   But he doesn't want to do our podcast, I think.
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:08.840]   So that's fine.
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:10.080]   He's got other things to do.
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:13.160]   But I did fork over some dough.
[02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:13.640]   I got it.
[02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:15.400]   I bought a 10-year membership because I only
[02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:17.000]   want to pay him once every 10 years.
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.720]   But fair enough.
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:21.200]   I just want to give him a plug.
[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:25.480]   If you're not a member, join pinboard.in is the best.
[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:27.640]   I can go on and on about all the tools.
[02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:29.200]   Look at the how to.
[02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:30.480]   There's all sorts of stuff.
[02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:33.920]   There's lots of very powerful tools.
[02:22:33.920 --> 02:22:35.000]   There's bookmarks.
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.760]   There's privacy.
[02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:42.640]   You can save websites in a database.
[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:44.480]   So even if they go down, you'll have them.
[02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:47.000]   They have a bookmark by email.
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:51.000]   As I said, the full delicious API.
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.400]   It's rock solid.
[02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:53.600]   It's just rock solid.
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:55.280]   I've never had a problem with it.
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:57.720]   So keeping bookmarks is a nice thing.
[02:22:57.720 --> 02:22:59.760]   And you can follow my bookmarks directly
[02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:06.160]   because it's public pinboard.in/you for user, Colin Leoloport.
[02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:07.760]   And so you'll see all of our stories.
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:09.520]   And I've been doing this for a long time.
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:14.240]   All the tags and all the stories.
[02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:15.440]   They're pinboard.
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:17.960]   Jeff, a number--
[02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:18.480]   A number.
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:19.280]   I'll make this.
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:20.760]   I now have media calls coming in.
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:22.160]   I'm doing ABC Australia.
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:23.160]   I'm doing CNBC.
[02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:23.680]   Yeah.
[02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:24.680]   I'm doing--
[02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:25.680]   Yeah.
[02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:27.000]   We love seeing you on the BBC.
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:28.240]   I'm not sure you're a Pepe.
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:29.320]   I'm not going to get me.
[02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:30.600]   But you mean you're going to have more--
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:31.800]   You're going to have stuff after this?
[02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:35.160]   This is what happens when you have an opinion, Jeff.
[02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:35.680]   I know.
[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:36.200]   I know.
[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:37.280]   See what happens?
[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:40.880]   I felt it interesting that according to The Guardian,
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:43.720]   the oversight board at Facebook has received so far
[02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:47.280]   9,000 comments in their public comment.
[02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:49.280]   Wow.
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:51.400]   Wow.
[02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:54.200]   9,000.
[02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:57.000]   Where did I-- was it the post?
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:00.360]   Somewhere had a good series of articles on the people
[02:24:00.360 --> 02:24:01.400]   on that board.
[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:03.520]   I can't remember where that was.
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:05.200]   Yeah, like so.
[02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:09.360]   Mr. Ant Pruitt, what's your thing?
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:13.280]   Well, my thing is something that it's piggybacking off
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:16.520]   of my days of being in the band and whatnot.
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:18.680]   And what some people don't know.
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:21.600]   And I know I didn't share with you all previously.
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:24.080]   I said that I played saxophone, which is true.
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:27.280]   But I also dabbled with playing around with the snare drums
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:28.720]   when I was in the marching band.
[02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:31.040]   And I got fairly good at it.
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:35.800]   But I just liked the-- I just love that motion and the sound
[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:37.880]   and the art of it.
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:42.440]   And this weekend I was watching YouTube on TV as usual
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:47.360]   and came across this Apex channel where they share one
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:49.840]   of their members trying to reenact.
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:54.680]   They drumline the movie's drum core competitions.
[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:56.520]   And I thought it was quite fascinating
[02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:58.840]   because he goes in and breaks down the technique.
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:00.240]   But he's not a snob about it.
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:01.920]   You know, he talks about how they're holding the sticks
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:02.600]   and so forth.
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:05.840]   And he dives into the rhythms and cadence of it all.
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:07.680]   And it's pretty fascinating to watch.
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:10.480]   And if you skip to the 16-minute mark,
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:15.960]   he gives you the actual full playback of him going through it.
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:16.720]   That's kind of cool.
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:19.520]   So he does the whole breakdown of it.
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:20.360]   And now--
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:20.860]   Right.
[02:25:20.860 --> 02:25:21.680]   And he's trying to memorize it.
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:22.520]   Yeah.
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:25.680]   Turn on my sound if you don't have it up.
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:27.160]   John's because we want to-- here we go.
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:27.640]   Here we go.
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:28.160]   You ready?
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:28.640]   Here we go.
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:36.960]   Were you in a drum line?
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:40.160]   No, I played here and there for our band.
[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:41.760]   But most of the time I was on the saxophone.
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:45.000]   We don't have-- I don't think we have drum lines
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:46.840]   as much here in California.
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:51.480]   I actually was the announcer in a drum and bugle core competition
[02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:52.320]   some years ago.
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:56.240]   And it was so much fun.
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:25:58.560]   I used to love watching DCI at Drum Corps
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:01.840]   in a national on TV when it's broadcast to competitions.
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:03.480]   I can't remember was it Fresno or something?
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:04.880]   Because there are a bunch of high schools
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:06.600]   that do some of this stuff.
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:09.800]   But we're too cool in the Bay Area, I think.
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:10.640]   But I love this.
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:11.120]   Oh, I love it.
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:14.440]   He's got it down.
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:18.760]   The thing is, he's doing what every one of these kids
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:20.600]   learned in this movie.
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:21.800]   I mean, they're doing it.
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:22.760]   Yeah.
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:23.120]   So--
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:23.720]   So good.
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:25.560]   Yeah.
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:28.680]   There's a lot of discipline, a lot of hard work,
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:30.320]   a lot of rehearsal.
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:33.120]   And then you have to be letter perfect.
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:34.840]   They are judging you.
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:36.920]   You are being judged.
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:39.440]   Yeah, like I said, he stops a couple of times
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:41.960]   in his attempt to memorize this.
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:42.960]   He says, wait a minute now.
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:43.880]   It's hard to do.
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:45.600]   He shouldn't be holding it this way
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:47.400]   if he's going to make it sound like this.
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:48.600]   And make this particular sequence.
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:50.320]   Well, he's a movie.
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:51.320]   You know.
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:52.640]   And he calls it out.
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:54.200]   But like I said, he wasn't a snob about it.
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:56.080]   He sort of had fun with it.
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:57.080]   That's really cool.
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:26:57.960]   But he nailed it.
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:26:59.320]   Man, I really enjoyed it.
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:01.000]   And I'm sure I'm going to watch more.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:01.840]   Is this a good movie?
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:02.560]   Should I watch this?
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:04.640]   I've never seen this movie.
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:06.640]   It's OK.
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:08.360]   It's got a lot of drumming.
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:10.880]   Yeah, the competitions are where it's at, though.
[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:13.240]   They have three different presentations
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:14.080]   in that movie.
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:15.800]   And they are stellar.
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:16.720]   I was not a judge.
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:17.720]   I was just the announcer.
[02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:18.720]   He goes, you know.
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:21.440]   And now from Fresno High School,
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:23.840]   the marching cougars.
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:26.280]   But it was so much fun.
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:28.200]   I really dug through it.
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:30.600]   It is very, very exciting.
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:32.440]   And you talk about the discipline.
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:33.240]   Oh, man.
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:34.880]   Speaking with someone--
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:37.920]   I can't remember who, but I was speaking with someone online.
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:39.400]   And they were giving me a hard time
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:41.280]   about my affinity with sports.
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:43.640]   And I told them that sports changed my life.
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:46.040]   It helped me to be a better human.
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:49.040]   And it helped me to look within, if you will,
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:51.440]   and help me with discipline and things like that.
[02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:56.360]   But also, my band practices were just as rigorous.
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:27:59.400]   And if you messed up, you had to pay for your mistakes,
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:00.040]   if you will.
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:03.360]   But it taught you just to be disciplined and pay attention
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:04.200]   to details.
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:07.520]   And then it also taught me the love of music.
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:10.880]   Granted, I don't always listen to hip hop
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:13.600]   and all of the bass and bumpity bump music.
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:17.080]   But I enjoy listening to some hot and zimmer every now and then,
[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:18.720]   too.
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:21.760]   Did you just call it that bumpity bump music?
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:22.840]   Bumpity bump.
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:23.360]   Bump.
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:24.520]   Grandpa and--
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:26.040]   Bumpity bump.
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:29.040]   You can't do your bumpity bump music.
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:30.560]   Get off my lawn.
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:33.480]   I miss my bass slides every now and then.
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:36.000]   Come on, we'll give you a ride in the maki.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.360]   It's got a very nice sound system.
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:40.560]   I'll crank it up for you.
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:41.280]   I'll crank it up.
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:43.040]   I was listening to--
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:44.960]   what's the hot one?
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:46.080]   The hot song right now.
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:46.440]   I can't--
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:47.240]   I have no idea.
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:48.400]   That's the thing.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:49.840]   Well, I don't either.
[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:53.600]   But Apple Music has the global hot 100.
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:54.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:55.960]   And I just turn up the bass, man.
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:29:00.000]   And I drive down the street like this.
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.920]   And prove it, hands on photography.
[02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:06.160]   Twit.tv/hop.
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:09.400]   We got to get you another gig around here.
[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:12.640]   I got to get you to more to do because you're so great.
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:13.640]   My goner on this weekend--
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:14.320]   Hold up.
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:15.520]   I'm tired.
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:16.640]   I'm tired of busy.
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:17.040]   You do.
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:17.600]   Well, you do.
[02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:20.720]   There's a lot of stuff for hands on tech as well.
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:23.440]   In fact, this week, you got a review on it, right?
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:23.920]   Yes, sir.
[02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:28.960]   Today is my Canon R5 and Canon R6 video.
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:33.040]   And yeah, just stay tuned because I have some thoughts.
[02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:34.320]   I'll just leave it at that.
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:36.600]   Make sure you're subscribed over there.
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:37.600]   Good.
[02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:39.040]   I'm fascinated.
[02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:42.080]   You might save me some money.
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:42.840]   I'm hoping--
[02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:43.400]   Yeah, I think I will.
[02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:44.520]   --open your city.
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:47.880]   Hoping you'll save me a little bit of money.

[02:31:14.840 --> 02:31:17.560]   I know some of you have gotten yourself a brand new camera,
[02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:19.360]   or you just had a camera sitting around
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:23.040]   and can't quite figure out how to get the most out of it.
