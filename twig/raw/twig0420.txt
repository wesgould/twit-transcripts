[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.920]   He was he had lots of fun. Yes, he tried to hang out with you Leo, but
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.720]   I'll pass like ships in the night. Yeah, I know you know you sent me a note and of course like all email
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.400]   I read it and then forgot about it, but I I forgot to put his number in my phone. I could it's okay
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   We weren't we were really kind of
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.200]   He said to you guys arrive like super late to yeah, the plane was late so we missed the
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.880]   Hall of Fame Awards and then and then was meetings all day because we were there really to meet with
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.960]   Agencies and advertisers and stuff like that. It was fun though. I'm glad to see I can report that podcasting is
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.520]   Vital and alive and there's a lot of great stuff going on a lot of people were there were new to it
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.560]   In fact, it was kind of fun for me to go to a podcast Expo and not be recognized
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.800]   Which means it's not the old timers is these new is new people, which is fantastic
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.960]   And I think it's not huge. I mean it's a tiny little conference. I don't know how many people were there maybe a thousand
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.600]   And the and the booths all fit in a hotel ballroom. So it's not giant
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.640]   Next week I got to go to the now here this podcast festival in New York
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.640]   That's gonna be a lot of big shows there too. It's
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.880]   Who's I bought the I bought the three-day ticket
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.960]   Yeah, I'm a little jealous
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.840]   I'm super jealous September 8th through 10th
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.600]   You get to see live
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.120]   Performances of comedy bang bang and planet money and Larry Wilmore Lavaar Burton
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.720]   John Lovett and friends love it or leave it lore criminal
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.120]   So you're gonna go see all those shows. Oh, we got a song
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.840]   Sense of the place and it's somebody who's a regular on podcasts. You'd probably look at this and go cheese
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.120]   Who would want to sit and watch podcasts? I don't want to sit and watch people like us talk
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.040]   I know
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   But there are a lot of celebrities. I mean you got Lauren Lapka's you've got Lavaar Burton
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.280]   You've I mean this is these John Lovett. These are very will war very will more. These are big name a lot of comedy
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.120]   Yeah
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.580]   Well, that's how to get more money. It seemed to be I was always the intro to podcasts, right?
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:24.280]   I always associate it with tech and comedy. Yeah tech first comedy came later, but a lot of comedians who are not working
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.240]   Yes, and the podcast and frankly journalist I endorsed that it worked really well
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.880]   And look at Mark Marin, you know, he his career is taken off fact
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.800]   He's great in the new Netflix original glow highly recommend him in that
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.800]   It's amazing. So there's you know a couple things on the on the run now that speaking of new kinds of content
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.160]   One is I just I'm about to finish listening to John Ronson's butter fire fleck butter flake just downloaded that tell me about that
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.240]   It's it's an ama. It's so it's audible. I think six part
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.360]   Podcast the thing it's free for our members. It's free for all members right now
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.400]   So and I recommend it highly John Ronson who wrote the shaming book
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.320]   He he starts with a single event a guy named Fabian who's thought that hey
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.160]   Why isn't porn free on the internet?
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.080]   And then Ronson looks at the butterfly effect of all of those things and it is
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.240]   Fascinating well reported quite amazing not
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.280]   I'll give you one example
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.040]   Don't worry
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.360]   So he's he sees all the effects of the free porn and how that what that does the industry then goes up to
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.520]   San Fernando Valley and talks to producers and directors and and talent and
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.480]   And he asked somebody there he said I recommend these women are just good all kinds of work
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.600]   Then they're gone and then they're kind of back there what happened well turns out that that in
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.640]   Porn you have to be either young enough to play a teenager or old enough to play a milk pardon me for that and in the middle
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.360]   There's no work in porn as we would now see it
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:10.240]   So there's a new industry that started in custom porn. Did you know that? Yeah? I didn't know that I had this real idea
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.120]   It's a big industry because people will pay to get stuff made to their particular weird fetish
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.920]   For Stacy
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.160]   Well
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.600]   The one that fascinated Ronson was a guy who
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.280]   Said I want you to take my my stamp collection
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.200]   I've been collecting for 30 years and I want three naked women to destroy it and burn it
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.640]   And then mock the guy who's playing basically him the owner of a standpoint strange
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.860]   I tell you that kind of stuff humans will never cease to amaze
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:52.240]   So is this so there's a new style of a show which is not what we do which is right NPR style
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.920]   But it's produced in that where you go. It's a Joey liked his stamp collection
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.920]   And then there's music
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.960]   But Joey didn't let me just play a little bit and just see can you get my you hear my audio
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.960]   But when you least expect them
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.160]   This story started for me when I happened to see a man
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.000]   Glance as a woman. It's totally that style
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.360]   So then the other thing the other news
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.280]   I think you should I feel yeah, yeah, he was a voice Leo
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.920]   Jeff Jarvis was a journalism professor
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.400]   One day when walking to his office. He noticed something odd
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.240]   Stacy Hickenbotham
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:49.480]   And I don't know but I just it's funny because it's it is it's basically a book and then for dubbies who don't read their eyes met
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.240]   And this is what happened
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.240]   Are you shipping?
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:05.840]   You know, I think it started with I'm almost certain it's ira glass and
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:14.080]   American life that created I thought it was like the BBC because the BBC does these highly produced radio dramas that these kind of
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:20.880]   I love their stuff. I really love their stuff, but listen listen to I'll just play at completely random
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   a this American life
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.080]   Sounds exactly so and just listen how it begins
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.380]   Paul's a cop in New York Paul Bacon
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.480]   Bacon no jokes, please
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.360]   And one night he did his regular for to midnight shift
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.200]   And then he was told that they needed him to cover a second shift in another part of the city and a little security booth in an area
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   They were protecting from terrorists basically
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   At 2 a.m. The other officer who's working in this booth with him takes a lunch break goes and takes an app
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.120]   And then at 3 a.m. It's Paul's turn for a break
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:09:01.240]   He's exhausted remember he'd already won I should point out I were glass between this great, you know kind of New York sound
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:10.200]   It says the beats are 40 seconds so we're at 30 seconds in I'm predicting in 10 seconds
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.960]   They'll be some music and he decides that he's also gonna take a nap be a payoff
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.880]   So he gets into his patrol car and he drives it
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.860]   Sway from the security I've never heard this car in the one available spot thinking there's no
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:29.500]   Then oh yeah, then you do sound that's a real sound then you do sound I could just it's a formula
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:35.040]   I don't mind it in fact this I considered for years this American life to be the best radio show ever done
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.920]   But it's a radio show
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.320]   Created from public radio and I in podcasts don't have to sound like public radio radio shows
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:50.840]   I'm just saying exactly amen, which is which is part of the podcast festival. I think of the non comedy ones they over produce it and
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.820]   And it's very good very good. I think there's room for both. What's the debate?
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:03.900]   Yeah, do you well? I'm worried because I get a lot of people who are like Stacy you should produce your show more and I'm like
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.760]   It's just Kevin and I talking about stuff. I don't tell them to listen to this show because it's even worse
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.520]   We're not storytellers. We're conversationalists in this in this world the irony is I have enough staff that I could easily do that
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.980]   Oh, yeah, but from day one I
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:26.440]   Decided that we would want to sound informal and live in fact to do it live here. Let's hear listen to Stacy's
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:33.280]   I like the music
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.480]   Hey everyone, welcome to the Internet of Things podcast
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.120]   This is your host Stacy Higginbotham and your co-host Kevin Tofel
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:49.040]   By the way, by the way, Stacy like you Leo has the smiley voice
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:55.480]   I have the growly voice you two have the smiley voice. That's you're the mustard to our manes. Yes
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.640]   I very oh, that's another thing I learned from Ross's thing in the custom porn
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.280]   There is a condiment fetish. I'll leave it there
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.080]   Okay guys, we don't need to talk about custom porn anymore no more
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.520]   But I tried to I tried to distract him, but I should so the other thing
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:17.120]   So the other thing I found interesting was that have you have you watched Facebook watch no, what's that?
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.640]   Facebook is shifting to
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.920]   episodic serial video loyalty video which makes me really interestingly own your reaction as to whether or not you would produce something
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.360]   10 minute lake for a week or a day
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.600]   For Facebook with revenue coming from Facebook given the amount of money. They're spending
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.280]   Well, they're they start producing stuff. I mean let's and so here's their promo. This is a
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.520]   Discover new shows to enjoy with friends and other fans introducing watch
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.880]   So they show it on a phone which is telling because they clearly
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:12:00.960]   Rolling that out, but if you go to your web version of Facebook, this is just gonna be music with pictures. Yes, it's talking about underproduced
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.880]   All right, so I run so if you I on the rundown I put where did I put it?
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:12.840]   I put an example of it if you go to your go to your own Facebook page, okay on the left, okay?
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:18.920]   Leo page, right? Yeah, no, I'm sorry the home page home page. Yeah, okay, okay on the left there is watch
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:26.480]   They gave it a pride a place there I get news feed. Oh, yeah, there is number three is watch. So these are original programs
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.320]   Oh look right loosely exactly Nicole season one episode one baby sitting
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.360]   19 minutes at 47 seconds mature
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.320]   So far
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.840]   Yes, not exactly short form
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:48.380]   Sitcom sitcoms 22 minutes brooch. This is van eyes. They don't call it the devil's taint for nothing
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:55.200]   This actually looks a lot of disgusting this is just one right up there. I want my phone back. Yeah, all right
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.420]   That one this looks a lot like sitcoms like sitcom pilots, right?
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.900]   This is a terrible idea. This is such a bad idea
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:07.100]   You're on the street on the trigger. I know right there on the street playing a game
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:15.140]   The deal is she's gonna offer you get back. She's gonna offer the money do something various with their phone be my guess
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.540]   This is what I want to send to your friend Kevin
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:24.660]   Hey, I'm going to this wedding in Australia in October. Well, you want to be my day
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.460]   I can't pay for all of it, but I can chip in need to know today
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.860]   Send it
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:37.100]   Well, yeah, you literally just said sending okay, so that's interesting
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.740]   Game showy
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:46.940]   Yeah, and I have to say it probably speaks more to the phone generation like they would kind of get into this the whole idea of sending texts
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:52.460]   She's great, you know, she's not the host. I think she's got some good energy energy
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.060]   It's on the phone. It's on the phone
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:02.500]   That show yeah, yes, yes, they they take your phone from you they plug it into the screen
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.460]   They find something embarrassing and then they say are you willing for me to you know put this on face
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:12.380]   That's the whole that's the whole game and then they eliminate people one by one until there's a winner
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.420]   And you're eliminated based on how far you're willing to go
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.100]   Exactly
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:26.380]   Yeah, exactly exactly let's try another one here. I want to keep your phone for 24 hours
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.860]   So I can resolve
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:35.060]   What do you say $100 keep your phone for just 24 hours?
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.020]   I can do whatever I want on it. That's by the way that music is totally
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:48.100]   Stolen from traditional game show production like yeah, you know dealer whatever the you know the question one is and I can't even remember
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.100]   My heart was racing as I heard it
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.860]   But it's totally manufactured because it really isn't that much problem really
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.700]   Can I keep your phone for $100 for 24 hours? What do you think?
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.540]   I will return to you at this same time tomorrow really? I mean is it that dramatic?
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:11.580]   $100 are you adding your mind you in the yours? Let's do this
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:17.540]   All the way
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:23.980]   Now 500
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.980]   Oh
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.460]   There's a audience of two
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:33.700]   This is like the chairs we make our studio audience
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:42.300]   I hear the question this appeals to it's obviously into millennials and it's with I like you know, it's
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:49.260]   Low cost I don't think it's even millennials. I think that is teachers. It's 17 year olds
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.180]   But that's not all of it. There's other things there too. I think I think you are blind
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:16:01.340]   There's lots of other shows stacking let's see what's stacking this weird
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:07.580]   Okay, something's emerging at the beginning of Gumby what they're used to be a show that yeah
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:12.240]   You know they're doing this is reverse video of a Jenga tower and of crayons melting so they're
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.500]   They're perilous heights. Oh, yeah, this is a weird thing. They do in Europe
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.340]   You've seen this Jeff where they yeah, that's a Spanish thing
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:27.020]   This is a whole show where they look at things and disorder melting and collapsing. I can't imagine anymore boring
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:33.540]   That's very you to be but it's too long for that. I mean this it's like those people the whispering people on YouTube
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.120]   Oh my god, what are they called the whisper crackly whisper people?
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.380]   There's a whole YouTube subculture. I just learned about it for my friend in the hour
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:46.300]   Hey, yes, thank you ASMR. What is it called again? What is it called again?
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.180]   ASMR we're gonna play a little bit of it. I
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.100]   gentle whispering
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:59.860]   Right, yes, oh right you know about this yes, I did there was actually an article about it just like as soon as I found
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.260]   Out about it so we wrote a
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:08.260]   Plate of a day ASMR the internet subculture of sounds that
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.180]   Feel good is going mainstream. Okay. I'm very the scream of course
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.780]   That you experience when you hear unique
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:27.700]   This is exactly like custom porn this just shows it's not sexual
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.740]   But it just shows this is the beauty of YouTube with a hundred, you know
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.140]   What is it a hundred thousand hours a day of new content anything can be served including?
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:43.140]   And not just that Leo the other thing I realized about custom porn is that we already know those custom content custom advertising when the custom porn
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:48.980]   Now anybody with money can make content the skill of making content is completely commodified completely
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.340]   So there's nothing special about making content so nothing
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.180]   This is a famous woman
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.020]   She is you have to turn it up if you want to hear it because it's very low
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:07.540]   Can I do it
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.940]   Talking like that I can I mean I can do it does it have to be a attractive young woman or good?
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.940]   Old man do it
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:20.460]   I don't know if you do old man ASMR. I shut her to think what you might find
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:27.900]   What I don't understand the appeal at all
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:36.860]   So there are people who feel that the sound of like it's relaxed fingers on a blanket or crinkling paper and whispering
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:42.020]   Oh, here's one. It's all very relaxed. Here's relaxing fluffy towel folds
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.380]   Hello
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:53.660]   Today I wanted to share another tutorial on how to fold out in a very decorative way
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:19:03.420]   Oh my god, I would I would swear to god. I would have thought this is like Saturday live or I'm going crazy one of the other
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:10.140]   That's real. I felt what I found out about this, but I Kia did a 30 minute or maybe it was 25 minutes had
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.900]   Based on this and it's this woman and she she really
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:22.540]   Just like yeah
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:35.980]   See if oh I find it so you're like my scream if I did this would you find this relax? So the oh should I talk like this?
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.260]   No, all of you just you must have
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:47.420]   Now we do this welcome together. It would make me seem so much calmer than usual welcome us
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.740]   everybody to another edition of this week in low talking
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:20:01.820]   Sorry, go ahead Stacy try it. No, no. I can't do it. I can't do it. Go ahead. I'm not Stacy you too
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:07.820]   I have been silenced all my life. I cannot I cannot let this silence
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:14.540]   Carsten can you do it to her voice taking control? Can you turn Stacy down control of it?
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.820]   The curve making it okay. You're owning your own Stacy. You're owning it
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:27.820]   Only somebody there we are only some there's quiet quickly Stacy with real Stacy's gone quickly can talk like that
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:34.540]   Now I'm told if I did if I did it in an Irish accent, it would be even better
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:39.260]   So if I talked like this in a very soothing way
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:45.740]   I'd like it a welcome you to this week in low Irish talking twill it
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.700]   Today we're going to talk about
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.980]   The sound of shamrocks when the wind dresses through some
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.940]   Unabutable. Oh, I have an idea. What let's let's counter this with the shouting show
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.980]   Let's shout everything we say
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.740]   Okay, so plus to your entire audience to get back. I know nobody's everybody said can we fast forward to
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.060]   The intro I could do it all like Herbert the pervert
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:17.420]   Come on in. I'd like to show you something in my basement
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:23.020]   So what it's interesting for Stacy's Stacy's got a migraine coming on this big. I got down
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:29.260]   Where is my alcohol? I have coffee today. You should always have wine for this show. I'm just saying
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.780]   I
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:40.300]   But it shows that's why I don't I'd swear I don't celebrate this in this NPR style podcast because it's so formulaic and there's and look
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.260]   There's so many things you could do
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.420]   And and it'd be silly to copy what we do too. I mean, I'm coming to be fair
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.500]   I'm copying kind of the McLaughlin group roundtable style news show
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:56.380]   I guess it'd be the closest analog to what we do and I always every time I've you know talked about doing a show
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.460]   It's always been like this because I like the dialogue. I like the kind of conversation
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:06.780]   Could you get me a nice soothing lamp in a we could turn the lights down a little bit
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:11.980]   How about later tune uh help Helen smash
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.780]   Helen smash
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:19.820]   I knew this week. I'm sure you're there. I guess to get back to your original point. I do see facebook
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.820]   youtube
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:22.860]   apple
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:30.060]   All looking with envy over the fence and netflix and hbo and saying you know the and by the way the reason
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:36.220]   Does it is different than why netflix does it is different than why apple does it is different when what audible does it?
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:42.940]   They're not they're not all the same goals apple really doesn't care so much about they want to generate traffic for apple music
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.580]   Uh, which helps sell hardware
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:51.980]   Uh netflix is dying on the vine or was because they can't get hollywood to give a movie or new movies
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.020]   So they had to make original content that worked really well
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.300]   HBO's always you know hbo started with movies, right?
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.940]   But they couldn't get the great movies. Well with movies, right, right?
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.180]   There are full of movies home box office remember why got all kinds of trouble
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.780]   Uh with the then ceo facebook because I was a people magazine
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:14.300]   Reviewing them in the first movies were nothing but an excuse to say hey work cable. We can show naked breasts
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.340]   Right and they were ridiculous these stupid movies
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:24.220]   Uh, by the way started it was crap. It's pretty funny because that's what game of thrones did every hbo show in the first
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.900]   At least pilot has net as nudity has sexuality
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.820]   As if they don't trust her name was raised they dropped it
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:32.380]   Yeah
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:38.060]   Yeah, and then in this season there's no there's well that we saw john snows, but but there was there was no other nudity
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:44.700]   And I thought it was great. If finally it's like let's get rid of this softcore porn that feels like hbo feels like they have to do it
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:51.340]   So here's my question for you leo. So there are other things are young turks is here. Uh, that's a great show
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.500]   That's kind of here because the young turks looks like a television news show doesn't it?
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:01.340]   It's kind of interesting lots of lots of different things are here right lots of different stuff including major major media stuff is here
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.060]   Would would you at twitch?
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.980]   They say they say the best length is more between two and ten minutes
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:13.660]   Uh, but you have anywhere from two to two hours. You can do we do short form. We do short form for the airco
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.660]   Can't produce a show for this
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.060]   Yeah for enough money
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.740]   money, yeah, um, we do we do stuff for the echo that we take right what we do is we take our
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:29.340]   Like for this show and others and we just take a good little section of something and you know three or four minutes and put it on the amazon
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:37.820]   My echo is broken. I can't hear it. I can't hear it. These voices are really soft. Do you know when your echo about very
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.500]   quiet stuff
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.140]   Um, I am gonna regret ever introducing you to
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:49.980]   internet subculture never heard of this did your daughter teach you this or did you how did you find out about this?
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.540]   Uh, my friend is a therapist in Seattle and so a lot of her
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:57.900]   She is apparently very in tune with this because some of her clients
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:04.060]   Use this. It's apparently a big deal for people. Oh, anxiety. So there's a okay
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:11.260]   Oh, it makes me so anxious. There's a serious thing makes me anxious as hell in therapy. It's autonomous sensory meridian response
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.300]   Well, so it's not actually okay people are gonna come after me. I think
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.100]   But this is not a legit diagnosis. This was actually part of the dinner conversation that
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:27.260]   Not me, but some of her therapist friends were having. Is this a real diagnosis? No, it's not it's just an internet diagnosis
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.020]   No, and I wouldn't call this a diagnosis, but there are people who find it relax
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.820]   Well, you know when you I used to do this my kids all the time
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.780]   We they called it chills. I draw I draw pictures in their back with the tips of my fingers. I'm sure you do this did this to your daughter
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.860]   Uh, that's one of the things that they do in this
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.220]   uh
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.060]   Whispering soft tiking lot talking light touches methodical sounds
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.140]   But I don't think this this is just if you feel good when you're getting a massage
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.420]   I get a massage every week for that reason, right or getting a haircut
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.300]   You know that great feeling when somebody's kind of playing with your hair
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:04.220]   Just gently I think we're on the verge of learning too much. Oh, well, you don't come on jeff
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.860]   I know you're grumpy, but surely you know what i'm talking about
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.260]   Now you're chasing a lot of me
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:17.420]   I am one of those people who like light touches. I'm like, oh don't touch me. Oh, that's interesting
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.180]   See, I mean, it's a maybe it's a thing. I love it evixa
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:26.060]   Well, she posted a very a good very long piece today about mindfulness
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.940]   And arguing that it's been that's an okay concept that's been completely ruined
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:37.180]   With marketing and all this junk that goes around it and and and you know junk psychology
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.060]   fascinating
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.060]   Wait are we talking about headspace
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:46.940]   I love headspace. No. No, hey google really loves mindfulness and he talks like that, right?
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:50.620]   Andy kind of talks quietly bob ross with his painting programs
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:55.820]   That's hope that was the whole thing about bob ross. You didn't want to be you didn't have to want to be a painter
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:02.220]   To stay. Do you know who bob ross is sure she does bob ross was great because he was so forgiving
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:06.060]   He was like, oh, I just smudge this don't worry about it. Let's just be talking about
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.780]   Van brush
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.740]   Is it marvelous they'll do wonderful wonderful things where you paint
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:21.340]   So this is shot and they finger-downs on a chalkboard to you oh torture complete torture sure you we can it's like slow talkers
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.340]   I can't take slow talkers
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:29.180]   People just a new yorker job. Yes, that's a new yorker. He wants to be jazzed up
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:32.220]   Yes
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.940]   You're proper that okay actually
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.580]   80d people
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:43.820]   I hope i'm not quoting another bogus thing, but I but I happen to look deeply into this
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:49.900]   There's a a company a group a physical medical group in the marine county that's functional MRIs
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.340]   They talk about different kinds of 80d, but essentially
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:58.060]   attention deficit disorder, which I clearly suffer from is
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.980]   oddly enough a lack of activity in the frontal lobe a
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.780]   Frontal lobe that's way slowed down. I bet you this might be what jeff why you like that stimulus
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.060]   And so add people are constantly trying to stimulate that
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.700]   That's why they like a lot of things going on at the same time
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.460]   Because they're trying to actually get normal activity in their frontal lobe
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:22.540]   And I don't think I don't think that that's I think that's widely that could be considered to be
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:28.780]   Well, it's a theory, but an accurate theory. I don't think i'm making up some some crazy thing when I say that
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:35.180]   And that's why a lot of the drugs for add. Oh, I think all the drugs for a childhood add are stimulants
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.380]   Yes
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.980]   Like that's a raw which is vitamin and ritalin which is a stimulant
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:45.100]   Because the they're trying to stimulate the frontal lobe and what I didn't I wasn't on drugs as a kid
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.620]   But I would do things you do hyper hyper focus is one thing you do
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:54.060]   Which is you you do the opposite you narrow everything down so you have one stim that used to play chess for that reason
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.940]   It's very focused or you like to have a lot of things going on once and I think it's kind of
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.620]   Our kids
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:05.260]   Now are have kind of a situational add because there's so much stimulus all the time
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.460]   That it almost creates a need for that
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.820]   So this is another thing I learned from the ronson podcast. There's a lot of good reporting. I'm gonna listen to this. Yeah
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.300]   the rate of
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:21.660]   What do you call it?
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.140]   Recident is enough where you can't get up
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.700]   Can't get erectile dysfunction or
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:34.860]   Thank you. So ed the rate of ed and people under 30 for years in many studies starting in 48 with Kinsey with running about two three percent
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:42.940]   Now it's running 26 percent because we're overstimulating these overstimulated with porn and other things that makes sense
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.940]   Fascinate
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.300]   And so so the belief that pregnancies are down
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:55.020]   It was oh well good sex education is working and the expert ronson talked who said no probably because they can't have sex
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.340]   So I understand facebook wanting to do this
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.580]   It's just like youtube and remember youtube spent a hundred million dollars and got nothing
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.660]   They had a chakilo kneel channel and stuff and all the celebrities he brought to youtube
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:11.100]   And I think youtube learned the lesson that youtube star people watch youtube for a particular kind of unique video
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:15.340]   It's not like any other kind of media. You can't bring old media to youtube and make it work
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.300]   I don't know facebook's learned that this looks a lot like
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:24.220]   kind of a youth youth and youthful not i should may i'll call euthanized a euthanized
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.860]   network television
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.100]   Where they're just you know it's still a game show here's you just now you're in the portal
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:37.740]   Still its reality show those sitcoms look very much like regular sitcoms with younger people in younger situations
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:41.020]   But I bet you they're gonna find out just as youtube did that
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:48.060]   You've got a create content that's native to your platform really I think so meanwhile youtube just put on redesign today
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.820]   I still drives me nuts about youtube
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:58.860]   I can't find it. I can't tell the difference it does and and I the problem I have with youtube is always the irony of being part of google
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:05.660]   Is I can't find out what's going on? I can't search there recommending things to me that are four years old next to things that are four hours old
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:11.740]   And and no way for me to get in and say what the hell's what's going on on the youtube? I can't ever find out because
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:19.100]   Everybody's well youtube okay, so purposeful jeff see this button on the left that says trending trending i know but that's
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:25.100]   That's as fake as the trend date on facebook. Yeah, it's probably youtube. This is what we want you to watch. Yeah
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.580]   surrounded by killer whales
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:37.660]   Yeah, and I you know yeah interesting. Yeah, it says oh yeah, and so I can't dig in or if I want to see what is this far right youtube that's occurring
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:43.500]   There's no way for me to dig in and find it or my fear of course is when I look at one you can search for it on google
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.900]   That's true it would come right up. I found asmr like that
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.900]   So
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:57.340]   So stacey has come around on facebook though right you after the first of all we should mention stacey is in austin but your family's in houston
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:03.740]   Your parents and they're okay. You grew up in houston everybody said good good vibes
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:11.900]   And and may our own megan moroni also grew up in houston and she says it's very chilling to look at these videos because she recognizes these streets
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.020]   Is that same for you?
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.580]   So okay
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:23.660]   Yes, it is in i'll just give you my little stacey's quick take on all of this because actually on monday
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:28.620]   I was I was not doing well. I was shook very um
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:34.540]   My family has lived on the gulf coast forever and when hurricane katrina hit in
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.940]   2005
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:41.660]   My extended family lost everything they were in balexy like literally their houses were all gone
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:45.340]   I think I had one cousin who managed to save their pickup truck
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.420]   and so
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:51.340]   That was killer. It was hard to watch. It was hard to recover from and it took a long time
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:56.220]   in what's unfathomable to me is that's happening right now in houston
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.860]   over
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.820]   A much longer time frame what happened with mrs
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:06.300]   Sippy not with norlin's but mrs. Sippy after katrina was you know very quick
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.940]   And now my parents have been holed up in their house unable to leave out here
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.300]   for like four days now and it's the water is not going down and
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.660]   It's hard to see
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:26.860]   It's hard to see all of these places that you know and love under water, but it's also hard to realize that
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:32.380]   This is this is not something that's easy to come back from and
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.660]   it's
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:39.100]   most of the people who were affected in balexy a lot of them left and the town is not the same and
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.100]   I
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.980]   Don't know. Um, it is it is tough
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.540]   So i bet houston's going to come backstage because new york sandy sandy hit us
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:53.900]   Really hard the aftermath of sandy is really difficult. I mean it's worse than the storm
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:34:01.020]   You you you weather the storm literally and then you then my god that the carpet you rip out and the drywall and the houses that are gone
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.820]   And the neighbors will leave and all that but then I think someplace his vibrant is houston
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.460]   I'm more worried about the towns that the storm is hitting now
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:15.020]   That houston i think houston just has houston's too. It's what america's fourth largest city. It's it's got to come back
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.260]   Doesn't it will come back
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.300]   Incredible
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.820]   The cost is going to be amazing a lot of there's a couple things
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:26.460]   There's a lack of the places that are flooding aren't places that are insured by floods
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:33.100]   This is not over. There is still water rising and it will continue to rise over the next few days
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.740]   and
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:41.180]   I think a lot of people will leave a lot of businesses are going to be affected and shut down
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:46.220]   So the poorest people who work in like the service industry at local restaurants and places like that
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.780]   They're not going to
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.140]   Your job's going to be gone for a long time and
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:56.140]   The impact of this
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.140]   I don't think sandy is a great
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:03.020]   And I'm not trying to i'm not saying that sandy was not catastrophic. I don't know
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.900]   This is this is beyond in so many ways
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:10.940]   Just the types of businesses the types of people who are affected
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.140]   But we'll see and then there's all these tiny towns like
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.820]   Yeah
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.260]   That are basically like parts of them are just washed away
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.100]   um
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.100]   And that'll be
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.940]   That'll be what it is. So we'll see it's going to take a while
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:32.220]   What I just put up a there's a great washington post column by david vondrel
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.540]   about the poor
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.140]   and these kinds of events and he said that he quotes a a
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.260]   Sports writer from long many years ago
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:46.460]   Who said that everyone gets the same amount of ice in life the rich get there is in the summer of the poor in the winter
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.740]   Yeah
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:55.100]   Uh, and and and talking about how expensive this is proportionally for people's lives if you're poor and and
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.140]   It's going to be awful for those who are rich can afford it
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.620]   But it's awful beyond belief
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:08.620]   The poor this is going to hit the poor terribly stacey what uh, what should people do who hear this your story and and uh,
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.460]   I know it makes me feel
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:16.140]   Very empathetic. What what in your experience is useful to do at this point donate to the red cross?
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.220]   What what would you like people to do?
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:23.740]   Take you know at this no, but at this point we'd like to do something. What should we do?
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:27.260]   There are a lot of good charities. I would also say
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:35.900]   This is crazy, but keep some keep some powder dry. Um, yeah, yeah, it's going to luisianne next by the way, right? This is
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:40.300]   This may not even be the first big storm. However crazy that would be
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.980]   but
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.580]   Well, it's it's not even this isn't even the first big storm. This is the third
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:50.060]   Third 500 your store 500 years storm in the last few years in houston. I mean
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:55.900]   Uh, this is this is almost a punch after two more punches and there and you're right there may be more to come
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.260]   Ike wasn't that bad reedo
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:03.660]   Rita was I feel like reedo ripped a lot of roos off
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:11.820]   Um houston's actually accomplished and good with floods believe it or not. Um, there but this is just unprecedented the hurricane itself is not
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:17.020]   It's the right the drama. It's like it's like mother nature learned a new bad trick
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.340]   It's like it's like it learned social media, you know, let me create a storm that just stays forever
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.220]   and that can happen anywhere, you know, it's not just
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.980]   Southern what you know golf places it could have the texas tribune
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:34.220]   Which by the way excellent jeff. I'm sure you're I'm sure you're familiar
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:39.820]   Status they're the greatest yes, they're fantastic organization news future of news
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:45.660]   But they have a site or they have a article that's actually very good how to get an offer help after hurricane harvey
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.260]   and things like i'm a big fan of the
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:54.460]   I use the central texas food bank, but the houston food bank. There's the texas diaper bank
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.380]   um
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.380]   There's going to be I mean if you
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:06.860]   If you're inclined you could volunteer to actually come down and do trips after this is done
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:11.020]   Um, they need medical workers right now, but later they're going to need construction help
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:18.140]   Um, this is great. You're right. This is a great article. It's on the front page of texas tribune.org
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:23.260]   Uh, and there's and there's just a lot of uh, resep places you can help
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.060]   Yes, this is this is I mean
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:30.700]   texas is not a place with a great social debt. Um
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:37.420]   So that's going to make this particularly devastating I think and I don't know how we're going to
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:43.180]   I don't know where it how those people I think there's going to be a lot of suffering
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:47.420]   ahead the other thing that I'd recommend for texas tribune and pro publica is a
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.900]   A major piece of reporting from 2016 called helen high water
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:56.300]   And as you probably know houston is the largest city in the united states without zoning
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:01.900]   And the amount of concrete washington post also had a good graphic on this the amount of concrete the
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.260]   The it's it's unobservant soil anyway
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.060]   And then the construction
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:12.300]   Uh, the mad construction in houston has led to there's there was no where for the water to go
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:18.060]   And you know, I could trash that with this piece I just saw yesterday about brelin where they're trying to make literally
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.580]   Make a city into a sponge. Yeah, yeah, um
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.420]   Austin has had
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.740]   Austin has had impervious so impervious cover is a huge debate in austin
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:32.940]   Which a lot of people in it's for precisely this reason because underneath of it
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.460]   Oh
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:40.860]   So we have eco create and all of these things that they don't have in houston but houston has been marketed for decades as being
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:47.020]   developer friendly that's that's what it is and that's also why it's got incredibly cheap housing
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:51.500]   And that's important to people and I
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:56.940]   It's uh, it's not to pun make a pun, but it's a perfect storm
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:07.980]   Um, it's a combination of all of these historic factors and uh, and current factors and probably climate change and it is it is a
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:11.020]   disaster
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:17.980]   If you if you're the kind of person who wants to give a donation and kind of have it spread as as widely as possible
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.540]   I think I don't I know some people don't believe in the red cross
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:26.620]   But I think the red cross is a great place to go the mayor of houston's created a relief fund the hurricane harvey relief fund
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:30.460]   And if you're the kind of person that likes to know who you're giving to go
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:35.740]   I think this is kind of cool go fund me has done something. You know a lot of people go to go fund me to raise money
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:39.740]   uh go fund me has compiled a list of all of the
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.700]   hurricane harvey relief efforts some for a little cynical
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:50.940]   I'm worried about some of these well, you know, you should but at this probably not now not the time to worry
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:55.900]   If you if you want, you know, I want to go to a big national organization then go to the red cross, but
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:01.260]   Um, it's you know if there's some of these are not great. Maybe okay, fine
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:08.460]   Um, but if it if it had you know anything anything you could do is going to help a little bit anyway
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.780]   I agree. There's probably scammers in here, you know
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:16.380]   The texas diaper bank. I'll throw that out there a lot of people have talked about it. It's a good one. They are
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:20.220]   Raising a ton of money, but diapers are
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:27.900]   And baby supplies are always difficult to come by and they are reputable organization that has deep ties in with the food banks
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.020]   so
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.020]   They they can actually make it
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.580]   Into the community in a way that's pretty
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.380]   In this heart so before we got in the air you were starting to talk about how I the the effect of IOT and how I
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.700]   You could be used in these kinds of disasters
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:49.500]   So this is this is me being a super nerd, but I have been monitoring my parents
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:55.180]   So my parents lived near it's called the Brazos river and it they're in a mandatory evacuation zone
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:42:02.540]   And so the second I discovered this I went to the hydrograph data from the uh, the us geological survey
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.580]   Does this and not here? I'll put a link to this is
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.700]   The hydrograph data. Let's find it
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:16.220]   I never know where to I mean you tweeted it so I I guess it's okay. I put like the picture of your parents street
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:22.700]   Yes, and that tweet actually has the hydrograph data too. Oh, nice. I can click that link on the tweet
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.100]   Yeah, so
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.100]   They've they've got this
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.060]   And it's everywhere that so that's my parents house. Um, are the front
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:36.700]   That's the the view from their front door to the and this has been this way the streets completely flooded for days
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.500]   For days. They can't leave
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:45.820]   No, they can't leave. I mean it would be risky for them to leave. I guess they could but it would be very risky for them to leave
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:51.820]   The car could die. A car can't go. They had a high pickup truck come and pick up my brother. Um, but
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:57.500]   So but the water should be going down and so what's cool is there's actually the lcra
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:05.500]   Has wonderful data and then the whatever the various noa and the us geological survey
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.020]   You can actually find really good data online right now for
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:17.740]   How far the rivers are going and how much rainfall is about fallen and that's I think that's really to me
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:23.820]   It's really comforting to be like oh they evacuated my parents because they expected this river to rise to 59
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:31.740]   The crest at 59 feet yesterday. So, you know, I've been glued to this thing for the last couple week or the last couple days
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.180]   And I'm like, huh
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:38.060]   It's not going as high and they keep lowering the forecast. So it's kind of nice, but the other thing
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:44.220]   Not internet of things is facebook. My parents aren't on facebook and my mom is trying not to have me worry
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:48.460]   So she's not sending me a lot of information, but I found a group on facebook
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:53.100]   Where my parents live so someone's on this kind of nice. I guess
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:58.140]   No, that's great. I'm stalking someone who lives near my parents. So I can see pictures
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.700]   The street and the house isn't doing it
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:07.180]   Right and then I also managed to connect I found out that one of my old friends from high school actually lives near them now
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.300]   So I connected the two of them. So now I feel like
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:15.660]   My parents who don't know a lot of their neighbors despite having lived there for like 30 years
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:21.820]   They now are part of this community of people who will look out for them and they will also look out for those
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.060]   People and I found it
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.140]   via facebook which
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.180]   Weird
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.820]   Because i'm not very into facebook as your mom is
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:36.780]   Not into it either. Um, how about facebook safety check? I I was talking about this earlier this week on the one hand
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:41.500]   It seems like a great idea that you if you're on facebook and they know you're in a disaster area
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.220]   They say let your friends and family know you're okay
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.420]   Click this button and then but if you're not on facebook
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.620]   And your friends and family know you live on the brasos river
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.860]   Or if you are on facebook, but you don't have internet because
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:45:01.740]   You're right then people are going to worry about you. I feel like safety check kind of is not the best idea
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.220]   I don't know. What do you think about that stacey?
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:09.020]   A couple of my friends. I think because everyone kept asking did do with the safety check, but
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.740]   Some of them who I knew were in danger
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:16.220]   They safety check themselves, but they gave me nothing else and that was highly unsatisfying
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:21.180]   Yeah, not I mean this is me personally right like darn it. I want to hear your story
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.180]   but
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:26.860]   I will say the coolest part about facebook was
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:32.220]   Under like what happened in houston is a lot of people were under evacuation orders
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.460]   But they couldn't get out because the roads were blocked so it was hard to know where you could go
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:41.180]   And so I was watching my friends and random strangers
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:48.060]   Who were friends of friends talk about okay? I 90 or 90 was closed eastbound, you know, or I couldn't get past
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:53.100]   You know belford on six and all of these like that would be useful wouldn't it?
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.940]   It seemed to be useful and then there were just lots of
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:01.980]   Lots of coordination among people like hey does is anyone in sienna plantations?
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:07.260]   My grandmother's cats are there and if anyone lives in that neighborhood and can go buy her house
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:10.300]   Please and someone actually ended up kayaking over there and
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:11.900]   I
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:16.460]   So we're not going to see a lot of that but we see a lot of like I liked
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:21.340]   It was heartbreaking to watch my friends, you know on
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:24.300]   Saturday be like hey, we're all good
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:32.300]   And then on monday's start realizing that whole crap my life is about to irrevocably change because my business and home are actually flooding right now
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.700]   um, right
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.340]   But it was also really heartwarming to see like
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:42.380]   how people were treating each other and taking care of each other
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:46.700]   Great great pictures of people carrying each other out
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:50.700]   Um the rescue is it's amazing seen a lot of those
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.500]   And now it's just the rest east
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:47:00.620]   It's things like hey the Kroger at this intersection is open if you can get to it and they have three
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:03.180]   They have three shelves full of milk like
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.900]   it's not just that's
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:09.660]   That's what kind of blows my mind and I know that it's boring but
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:15.420]   In the people in Houston are actually complaining a lot about the national media coverage, which I don't
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:23.980]   They're like it's too, you know rescues and in we're doomed and really what would be useful to us is knowing where the grocery stores are
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.620]   Or which stores are open which roads are open?
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:33.180]   You know that kind of information in the chronicle the local paper was doing that but facebook was filling a lot of those needs as well
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:38.300]   I don't expect cnn to tell me what grocery stores are open, you know in sugarland
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.140]   so
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.780]   I don't know. I just the internet was a really
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.060]   really powerful tool here that I
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:52.060]   Was really glad we had yeah and the other piece too is so when Katrina hit New Orleans
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:57.820]   I had started nola.com and I left the company right before Katrina hit but but there were cases of people who
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.780]   Couldn't you know, there was no twitter
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.540]   um
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:07.660]   And there were cases of people who they could barely get a message out to some relative in in Utah
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:12.220]   Who would then go on to a forum on nola.com the news site that I helped start
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.580]   And and and that was monitored by the police to get the rescue here
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.740]   You saw that you saw that crude beginning of it then
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:23.260]   And now you have the fact that that besides 9/11 besides the fact that we have cell phones and we could call
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:29.580]   Um, you have new monitoring structures, which I think will only improve more after every one of these national disasters
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:33.260]   There are efforts to try to put it all together and just do one tool and then people make a hundred tools
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:36.460]   But you can see a facebook and a twitter
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:41.980]   uh creating combined tools that really get to that kind of information more efficiently
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:47.580]   Yeah, and that's why and you know for people who aren't there
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.460]   you know
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:55.740]   There were people who went and walked around neighborhoods and knocked on doors just to make sure because like
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:01.500]   Yeah, even though these were mandatory evacuations. You can't mandatorily evacuate a million people
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:06.620]   So it's basically like, uh get out now. Here's the routes. We don't know how long they're going to be open
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:13.180]   Um, and if they stay put, you know, there's no one who actually knows who's where so in a city like you stan
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.740]   I don't know
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:21.980]   Okay, that was that was like well. Here's another story. This is from the New York times. This was a picture of a
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.660]   uh, uh, uh, assisted living center in um
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.660]   Houston look how high the water is it's up to the table
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.700]   They were told to stay put but the water kept rising
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.340]   Uh, somebody tweeted it
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:41.340]   Another woman in Houston. There was a some conversation on twitter. Oh, that's fake then somebody in Houston. No, that's not fake
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:45.420]   See that woman the blanket. That's my sister. They figured out where it was
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:54.060]   Yeah, gallveston the gallveston newspaper did it. So the person who tweeted it was the son of the owner of that nursing home
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:58.780]   And dikinson which is outside of it outside of goutster. I don't know
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.020]   um
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:04.220]   And so yes people thought it was fake, but it was not fake and
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.500]   The goutveston commissioner county commissioner says no no
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.140]   We knew they were in there and we we were going to rescue him anyway
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.740]   But I don't think it hurt
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:18.860]   Too much to have that picture all over twitter that might have uh stimulated a little bit faster response. That's just terrifying
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.940]   It's awful, uh to see that
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:23.100]   um
[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.100]   Wow
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:29.900]   Yeah, and if you see I mean like instagram has these crazy posts
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.700]   um, I guess
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.700]   Reco did a story on snapchat
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:39.980]   What I would have liked to see google had a map that showed the road closures
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.620]   Uh, let's see. I don't know if it can bring it up but google
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:48.140]   Rb road closures and the chronicle had one
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:51.180]   But like that was kind of the
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:57.260]   That was one of the more challenging things is trying to figure that out and I feel like google didn't do a great job
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.380]   But it tried
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:06.380]   It's it is interesting that facebook really has google has a safety check, but nobody I don't know if people know about it
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:11.580]   Um, it does seem like google kind of didn't jump on this one
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:15.820]   Yeah, if you do google carvie crisis map, you'll see
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.900]   You'll see so I mean, but
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:25.580]   It wasn't apparently it wasn't as good as what people needed to actually get out
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:30.780]   Now it the challenge is it was changing all the time really quickly. Right. So that
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.660]   I don't know
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:40.380]   This is where big data should be of value, right? These companies have spent so much time and money to collect every bit of data there there is
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:43.420]   Presumably, I mean
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.820]   That that collection doesn't stop
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:51.740]   With a disaster, uh, you can that there seems like they would have a lot of information that would be useful
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:56.300]   Yeah, and also like phone companies are going to know where there's an active phone within a cell
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:52:01.820]   Right, uh, there's you know if you want to find out who's people are around there's other ways to do that
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:09.580]   There's a lot of what they can be done. Look at all the flooded. Yes. Well, there's your privacy issues here. Yeah, so this is I mean
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:15.580]   There's ways to handle you not publicly but but privately to the authorities to say
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:22.220]   You know, if I have zero objection to the cop saying in an emergency such as this show me
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:27.740]   It's like what it'd be like going by with infrared show me where you think there are people phone company. Yeah
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:35.100]   Yeah, well what we need is a coordinate a more coordinated system where you know all of these data points can be
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:39.180]   shared and uh
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:44.220]   Somebody's asking of course we have a regular on our shows Dwight Silverman
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:47.820]   He's checked it on safety check that he's okay, but that's one of the problems with safety check
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:51.500]   That was a couple of days ago. I haven't heard anything since so that's another one
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:55.420]   That's a that's a really good way. Yes. He's such a good guy. Oh, you know Dwight
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:58.540]   He is a good guy. He was with he was with the Houston Chronicle tech
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:04.940]   Or ever and he was on our shows when he was that and then he's he recently about a year ago said
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.580]   I'm not gonna do your shows anymore because I'm not doing tech anymore
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:09.900]   Oh
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:13.420]   Well, okay, uh because I'm Dwight we'd have you on no it doesn't matter
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:15.500]   You still have an opinion on tech. I'm sure
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:23.180]   He wrote a story for arse technica. Oh, oh, no, he did not he tweeted a story from arse technica by eric burger
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:26.940]   So I don't know if
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:34.220]   Dwight did it. So uh the fat vegan chef on twitter tells me that ways also has a bunch of editors keeping closed streets
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:40.300]   Updated in their map for houstonary. That's perfect ways knows where there is no traffic moving. Yeah
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:45.020]   So people people complained about ways and that was that was what I thought I was like, huh?
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.980]   so I was very curious what ways was doing because
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:51.500]   There ways generally depends upon
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.980]   manual street closure
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:57.580]   And it's actually a page report a street a closed street
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:02.860]   Oh, okay, because yeah, a lot of people were your apple maps are showing closures
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.940]   I mean, it seems like maps programs. That's one of the first things they should do
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:14.940]   Especially since driving in a flooded area is so dangerous. That's how a lot of people die including houston police sergeant
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:19.500]   Um, you would think that don't drive here would be a very high priority
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:28.060]   Well, it changes so rapidly. I think that is part of the issue, but that's where ways I would think could be really be hugely valuable
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:34.700]   That's the one kind of you know constantly updated crowd sourced information for roads
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:39.660]   Ways should have a at a button, you know flooding here
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:46.140]   Maybe during a crisis perhaps or and the other challenge is
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:54.940]   rerouting someone as the roads close is really tough, right? Like I can't imagine trying to drive out of
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:55:00.460]   What basically is like scenes from the apocalypse, you know, you're like, oh jeebus. Yeah
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.940]   so
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.540]   So that's harvey
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:07.500]   Harvey that was our harvey news. Yeah, we've got our harvey
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:14.940]   And Dwight is fine. He's on twitter and he's active and as you said he's he's tweeting a lot of houston news
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.860]   Including pictures of the the chronicle newsroom
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:24.380]   On the news warehouse in emergency mode many journalists
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:28.940]   Working remotely. There's a little bit of water there on the floor. Oh, yeah
[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:32.460]   Uh, but uh still people in there
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:37.260]   I can't even imagine I just can't imagine what that but that must be like
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:40.940]   Are you tempted to go down there stays you probably not
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:48.620]   Um when I can get down there. I will go down there to volunteer. Good right now. Good. There's no way to
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:55.020]   I would not help at this moment in time. I would just be another body in the way. You don't want to get in the way. That's right
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:56:00.620]   Uh, well, I think I think you gave us the best resource
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.420]   Uh, which is that what is it again the texas
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.220]   This is tribun tribun
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:08.460]   dot org
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:13.260]   And they have right on the front page there a way that you can get help or help
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:21.420]   Depending on what your particular needs are it's a second article down how to get and offer help after hurricane harvey
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:27.660]   And that's a really good resource. I think everybody watching this probably wants to reach out in some way
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:31.820]   The good thing is you do see all the tech companies making it easy to donate apple
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:36.060]   Is always been very good about that putting a red cross donation button on its iTune store
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:41.660]   Uh, so it's very easy to you know give 10 bucks. I saw a great tweet this morning
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:43.100]   ladies
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:49.020]   If a guy hits you up in a bar and asks for your phone number take his phone and text ten dollars to the red cross
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:57.660]   I thought that was a good idea. I could do that on the on the on the new uh, facebook show one more here
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:00.540]   USC waller on twitter says the way who is a
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:05.980]   Volunteer ways map updater. Yeah says the way says 50 plus volunteer editors closing roads
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:10.300]   We depend on info from user reports twitter cover reports, etc. That makes sense
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.420]   That makes sense
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:20.700]   And then he or she is map editor and south carolina state manager. Yeah, the environmental engineer. So you know your stuff
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:22.700]   Awesome
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:26.140]   Really interesting. Yeah. All right. I wonder if you could pull in data from the api
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:31.660]   I know someone complained during the rain on the weekend to google that
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:36.300]   Austin has a site called atx floods and all the rain gauges
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:43.100]   They pull in data to this website that says hey, we're underwater. This road is now closed
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:49.980]   So if you go to atx floods, but apparently during the flooding that we had in austin which was very minor
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.060]   But we were all like, uh, we're gonna do a lot of rain
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.260]   um
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:58.780]   It exceeded its api calls basically to to google and so they had to ask for help from google
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:03.660]   And in the rest of the world google maps now makes it easier for you to find parking
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.780]   whoo
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:16.140]   Parking not really a problem in houston, but the rest of the world you can there's a actually parking difficulty icon on the destination card
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:18.780]   And uh, I know
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:24.860]   When I was in seattle where they tested in a couple weeks ago. Yeah, it's been slowly rolled out in seattle was one of the places in fact
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.300]   They're now adding
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:32.620]   Cities outside the us including Amsterdam london medrid moscow perese roams out south powellow at toronto and van kuver
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:37.100]   You can find parking garages near your destination when you use maps
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:42.860]   Automatically add it to your trip so you see the button with the p and the plus you can add parking to your trip
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.780]   It also includes walking time to your final destination
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:49.820]   Well, that's what's fascinating
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:57.900]   About this flood thing is we're kind of in this weird world where there's should be ample data stuff like this
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:02.700]   And then there's not enough data or maybe the maybe there's silos data silos or whatever
[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:07.100]   But obviously google's made a deal with parking garages in fact google's
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:16.700]   Well, actually tech crunch is speculating that at some point google might add the ability to make a reserved reservation for a parking spot kind of like open table for parking
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:24.540]   I oh you can do that for your car if you're on the e-charge network. I think that's a good idea. Yeah for the electric cars. Yeah
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.380]   Yeah
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.940]   Uh, yeah, it's in uh, it's not in austin
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:32.540]   lana boston charlotte chicago cleveland dallas fort worth
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:35.820]   dc denver detroit houston l a miami
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:41.580]   minneapolis st paul new york city or lana philadelphia phoenix pittsburgh portland san diego
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:45.660]   sacramino san francisco as you noted seattle and st. lewisantampa
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:53.260]   Google it was very accurate in seattle too. Nice. It would be like this is part this has ample parking and i'm like
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.660]   Well, and then i was like oh it really does
[00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:58.860]   it did
[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:04.620]   Uh, if you if you want to have some fun gaming, uh google you can game the google translation
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.260]   app
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:13.740]   Somebody has and uh, if it created translation for kim jong-un as mr. Squidward
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.500]   of course one of the characters in sponge bob
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.220]   square pants
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:24.620]   I didn't know translate
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.700]   Was crowdsourced
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.220]   Well, actually they translate supreme leader as mr. Squidward. Yeah
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:34.300]   Yeah, so they're every i guess a lot of people got on there and said supreme leader
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.180]   And korean that equals mr. Squidward in english
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:43.260]   I bet you didn't have to get a lot of people because i bet there's not a lot of people trying to try to translate it. No, korean
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.860]   yep
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:47.340]   I like it. So leverage your power
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:50.060]   Ta-da
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:55.660]   So are we gonna talk about let's see ar in arcore because there was surely uh tech crunch
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.420]   Uh
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:01.020]   Did they they were playing with some apple ar stuff and so I was like
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:08.300]   They were talking about ar selfies. I don't know if you saw that. Yeah, and so that's one of the things that will be coming in the new iphone. We hear
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:13.180]   Yes, ar core is is google's dumbed down version of tv
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:19.340]   tangos he google's been ahead of this game with tango, but the problem is to do tango you need a certain hardware platform
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:25.740]   ar kit so successful that google has unveiled ar core which is
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:31.340]   Similar not exactly the same thing, but the idea is it makes it easier
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:38.620]   For developers to take advantage and you've seen we've shown this but you may have seen these these demo videos
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:43.260]   tango requires a significant hardware and of course you got to talk
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:48.860]   Phone companies into putting that hardware in to date only the asus and phone is a consumer grade
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:52.300]   tango platform, but ar core does not
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:02:00.220]   So it would work on almost anything, you know modern the pixels samsung galaxy sa as long as you're running 7.0 or higher
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:03.580]   so something
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:09.580]   I was gonna ask because I was a little confused is every device gonna be ar core certified or do you just have to have some
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:14.860]   It's like ar kit so apples ar kit goes down to I think the iphone five or five s
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:19.340]   Uh, this is kind of similar ar core. You just have to you have to have android 7
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:22.300]   Which is in most cases means a fairly modern
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:28.060]   Android handset, but you don't need any special hardware, which means it's not going to be as good as tango
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:36.300]   Right, but so toy to play with laura and here's some examples you can if you can only get tango on one device or two devices right
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.700]   exactly
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:42.700]   Yeah, it's awesome, but you can't have it. It's hard. It's hard to know. I think this is google
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:45.580]   It's a little preemptive strike from google because the iphone
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:50.700]   with you know the new iphone will be coming out september 12th or announce september 12th
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.700]   We think now so that's two weeks
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:57.580]   That's a week from tuesday two weeks from yesterday and the new pixel pixel we have a date
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:01.420]   I don't know how you know accurate this date. It's not a it's not an official date
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:05.660]   But somebody said october 5th. Let me see if I can find that article
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:10.860]   It's all the one of last year. Yeah, here it is from android police last year google
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:13.740]   tried to get it out before
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:17.980]   Apples announcement this year. I guess they figured well. What are you gonna do?
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:22.300]   Yeah, apples is on september 12th, right? Right. So
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.740]   That's soon soon
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.140]   week from tuesday
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:32.620]   Not much not much more to say about the pixel 2 we already know a lot about what's in it
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:36.940]   Don't get all excited because it has the 836 snapdragon in it. That's one betta
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.660]   It's not it's pretty much the same
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:43.420]   The uh the 845 will be the next big snapdragon
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.060]   Jump and that's not gonna be till next year
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:51.100]   The eclipse mega movie we talked a little bit about the fact that google was trying to get people
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:57.900]   Who were going to be taking pictures of the eclipse to contribute? I think they got what do they say 119?
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:04.060]   Photographers and the idea will be and I think this is kind of unique to get
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:07.420]   Video of the eclipse as it travels over the country
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:11.820]   So this is a video that google has posted they posted this morning of the making of
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.300]   Some of the people who will be doing?
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:20.540]   Photography and videos will be or did I mean did sorry, but who will be in that? I thought I just got back
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:25.740]   You missed it. You missed it. Sorry. No, yes, who did it and will be in the mega movie
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.900]   Is the mega movie out? Oh good. Let me look. Hold on a second
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:37.500]   These are people doing it scooter x just gave me like Rick small ones a day in the life of america stuff. I love the idea
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.540]   34,000 images
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:43.420]   Of the eclipse you ready to watch
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.380]   In the mega movie
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:51.180]   I think you're getting audio from let me see if you're getting an audio from another tab
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:55.980]   I have too many tabs open
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:58.940]   Here is the here's the audio without
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:02.700]   Algorithmic they stitch together based on time and location
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.580]   to give us an extended look at the sun
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.980]   And so we're kind of you can see on the lower right you can see the path
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:13.580]   Wait, do I need my glasses to view? No, you can look at this and say
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.300]   Unless you're the president. It says yeah, right? He did you know what he's so amazing
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:22.300]   He can look at the sun without glasses. You know what this seemed like a good idea at the time
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:27.900]   Cheese did you see shep smith the day of the of the eclipse? Do you see that compilation now?
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:33.580]   I put it on l- I'll tell you it's hilarious. I put it on last week's rundown. I missed it. Obviously I wasn't
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:37.180]   Shep smith
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:43.100]   So this is really not such a great idea as it turns out. No, it's just a lot of pictures exactly the same
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:50.940]   Well, isn't it to study the corona of the sun none of these look how oh, this is to make a google look how crap the quality is on most of these
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:55.580]   I think astronomers had their own pictures. I'm guessing I don't know
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:06:01.820]   Your friend Neil deGrasse Tyson was kind of dismissive of amateurs making such a big deal of the eclipse
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:04.380]   Yeah, they happen all the time. What are you so excited about?
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:08.940]   So if you if you I just put on the rundown of the comments the chef smith video
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:15.100]   Um, someone of fox news force shepherd smith to come to work and cover the solar eclipse. Let's just say
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:21.740]   He gives if I put this here and my phone here. I have a total eclipse of the phone
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:26.460]   Fascinating it's amazing. Oh my god. The moon has gotten in front of like Neil
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:31.500]   I don't know. It's interesting looking the sun looks a little like the moon up there in my wall
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:35.420]   If you mention it, you got to sing it where the deer and the end is a little plumb
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:41.660]   Oh my god. Wow. Would you look at that? It's a total eclipse of the sun and you look up at this
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:45.580]   Shepherd
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.940]   Coming out. Oh my goodness. That didn't last long
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:55.660]   More no because now you can look at the thing. It's covered so you can look at it. She's thinking got a memo
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:59.500]   Halloping Rupert doesn't really care about this
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:06.220]   Weird like at the opposite. He's your shuffle once in a while. Why he does his own thing amazing. Yeah, I love nature
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:12.620]   Amazing. I'm gonna die now and we hope that doesn't happen. I want to see a total eclipse of this monitor
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:18.140]   How about total eclipse of the monitor? I think well, we're yeah
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:23.740]   I think he's just making fun of us like the media. I thought the eclipse was cool. Damn it
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:28.780]   My wife got mad at me for poo poo in the eclipse. It was taking away people's fun
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:34.540]   We made the best part of the eclipse was my husband came home in the middle of the day
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:39.580]   And we cut up our cereal boxes to make our eclipse things and we sat there and looked at them and we're like
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:43.020]   Yeah, that was cool. But the cooler part was just
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:44.700]   Middle of the day
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:49.340]   Cereal parts and crafts eating cereal in the middle of the day because you had to empty those cereal boxes, didn't you?
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:52.860]   You know, they come in they come in plastic bags. You can just take them out. Oh
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:55.900]   I know
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.700]   So now you have a bunch of
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:59.820]   formless
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.020]   nameless
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.020]   heads of sugar and
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:06.860]   Grains sitting in your kitchen. Oh, we only have healthy
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:09.500]   Cauchy like cereal. Cauchy's good
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.300]   Healthy it's not but Cauchy is good
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:17.420]   Did you are you saving a big Lee at the whole foods these days?
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:22.220]   I am not so I'm not a whole food shopper. I'm a central market shopper. Okay, I know
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:27.100]   It's it's a Texas thing gotta stay gotta stay true to my h&b roots
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:31.900]   Prices cut as much as 43% and they're selling Amazon echoes
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.180]   Farm fresh Amazon echoes in the store
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:37.980]   Which cracks me up?
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:42.380]   I don't know what to say about that. All right. I'm excited about, you know sinking all that together
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:46.540]   I can't wait to get discounts because I'm a prime member. I guess
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:49.340]   Oh
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.340]   Whole Foods has goods salsa
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.860]   Yeah, actually the prepared foods at all foods are quite good
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:58.940]   And an amazing cinnamon bread holy cow. Oh boy
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.740]   cinnamon bread
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.420]   Jeff
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:06.700]   Do we need to nationalize google facebook and amazon?
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:12.140]   Oi this is peak guardian. This is my communist friends. How are you?
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:18.460]   This is looming. These monopoly platforms are hoovering up our data have no competition
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:22.380]   They're too big to serve the public interest rights nick shrinichik
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:25.340]   Oi oi oi
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:31.420]   Like well, but come on now you gotta do more than
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:37.820]   You gotta tell us why he's wrong as one person said on facebook when I posted it, you know, okay
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:40.860]   Well, what government takes it over one somebody said how about licton stein?
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:44.380]   Yeah, uh, which government do you trust to take over the internet folks?
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.940]   Estonian Estonia
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.300]   Estonia
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:53.500]   I trust Estonia around. I salute the Estonian internet the the Iceland internet. I'll be right
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.100]   No, no
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:10:00.620]   Asking it has a little financial little corruption in the financial well, but they fixed it since I think all right
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:06.300]   And it's it's it's it's it's it's the classic absurd argument taken to
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:11.820]   The absurd length, which is we don't like them. They're capitalist. Uh, they shouldn't be making money
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:17.180]   They're stealing from us. They have too much power. They're too big. So let's just take them over
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:21.420]   Yeah, yeah, the government's gonna do a great job running amazon
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.140]   And google and facebook
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:29.420]   So obviously if you think about it, there's not there's not a good nationalization solution on the other hand
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:36.140]   I don't think it's unreasonable to worry a little bit about this scale to which these companies are reaching and the power that they're aggregating
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:39.900]   So did you see
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:43.980]   The article by kajmary hill a couple days ago about how
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:50.220]   There you go. There's got to be an explanation. Yeah, yes, there is probably an explanation
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:54.220]   She wrote an article in which she said it's uh
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.460]   somehow
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.460]   Facebook with its unrevealed
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.620]   algorithms
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:06.220]   Figured out a family member of mine that I did not know about and recommended them to me
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.780]   I'm not
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:14.700]   Facebook figured out my family secrets and won't tell me how and it won't tell me how this has cashed me writing ink his moto
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.980]   Um
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:21.100]   So I think what's challenging here is right now
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:27.820]   Most of the population is not aware of how much information is being quote-unquote hooverd up
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:32.300]   about them and how it's being used and there's no
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:36.860]   There's no transparency on some of this and people take it as
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:41.340]   as unbiased because it's an algorithm because it comes from
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:44.860]   Facebook or because it comes from a computer
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:51.660]   And we see that trust or that trust in algorithms playing out with like oh, we'll have software to present
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:59.740]   Dict recidivism among you know inmates and use that to determine parole, but we don't understand how it's exactly working
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.060]   So I don't think it's wrong to say
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.300]   Facebook
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:08.780]   This is a little weird that you're doing this and giving me these suggestions. How are you doing it?
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:13.500]   There was another story about someone seeing an ad for a mini projector
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:20.380]   After on Facebook, I think it was or maybe it was on instagram after talking to someone about it and he was concerned that
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:26.460]   These stories a lot that they're my echo is listening to me and so I don't buy them for a sec
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:29.740]   I think I think the concerns are
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:36.300]   Understandable and I think if companies actually were a little bit more transparent about how they're doing things
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:39.500]   Absolutely agree with that. That would yes. That would help
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:46.540]   Alay these assuasion well speaking of transparency. So meanwhile then google and facebook each
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:49.580]   Took what I think were num-nuddy moves this week
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.020]   Google
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.980]   erich mitt supposedly went to the new america foundation
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:00.940]   He did something that someone affiliated with them had run the new american foundation then reportedly
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:07.500]   Uh got rid of that writer and then the whole project which is around monopolies that wasn't new america left
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:15.580]   This is not a good thing for google to be anywhere near especially when the project about monopolies was involving the EU
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:22.060]   So it looks like google and I don't know, you know, maybe google did or didn't maybe new america overreacted or didn't
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:26.140]   I don't know, you know where the pressure points are and how great the pressure was but
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:30.940]   The worst thing to happen is for google to do that meanwhile
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:37.020]   Facebook hired the former public editor of the new york times
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:43.660]   This spade to handle transparency now gizmodo called her incompetent
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.620]   I know and and the outline called it worse
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:50.060]   I know people didn't like her and we talked a little bit about on sunday
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:53.020]   And there were some odd things that she did
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:59.340]   But I thought i'm gonna defer and judgment until I hear the headlines were cruel of effect
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:03.340]   I tweeted that story facebook hired the worst person in media to work on transparency
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:08.540]   I just really heard i mean i just tweeted that and then a friend of hers excoriated me
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:13.420]   And I said, okay, you know, this is not civil and I said you're right the headline on its own does say that
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.500]   But the piece is actually though devastating
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.020]   uh
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:18.860]   a fair compilation
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:24.700]   And and I think that this is carris swisher writing a recode and she points out that she as a
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.540]   Cub reporter
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:31.180]   Worked for Liz spade at the washington post when she was washing the post respected the hell out of Liz
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:33.580]   Yeah, and I and I do not doubt that for a second
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:37.660]   But her tenure at club major was reviewing her tenure at the new york times was
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:43.340]   A real problem. So she had a problem here. She was following the most amazing public editor
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.900]   of the New York times and that's one of the New York times
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:53.980]   Fired Liz they they killed the position because they they realized there you can't you can't do better than Sullivan
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:59.900]   You know the worst thing that in a job that involves how media reading manipulated right now
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:01.260]   She got manipulated
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:07.980]   Uh in a fairly public way and she went on to uh tucker crawlsson show complaining about a writer's fortune tweets
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:12.380]   These were unfortunate things so my only point is this so so these the plattin this case facebook
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:14.460]   I think is trying to do the right thing
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:15.580]   but
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:21.660]   Because the the paradoxes of this is because they're not being transparent enough to hear people's opinions and voices and get nominees
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.660]   There are many people who could do this job really well
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:28.940]   They I think take a step backwards and and full disclosure again remember I took a lot of money from facebook
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:33.660]   Uh for the news integrity initiative. I'm independent of facebook and i'm using that independence right now
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.180]   um
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:37.020]   but uh it's it's
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:40.700]   It both are illuminating of the fact and i
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.020]   Saying is I certainly don't want to nationalize google and facebook and amazon
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:49.340]   But they do have a hell of a lot to learn about transparency back to your point stacey
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:53.900]   And these are two examples where they're just not seen and inch ahead of their nose
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:59.980]   In terms of what the reaction is going to be either in the public or in the case of the spade thing among journalists
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:02.540]   uh and it
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:03.820]   They're not
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:09.900]   Connected enough with the world around them. I don't know if facebook actually cares about what journalists think
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:12.940]   And I don't think that's a terrible thing in all honesty
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:19.340]   Um with this hiring. I don't I don't think they're like, yeah, let's find this person. She's good. She's free. Let's ask her
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:21.740]   I think I think that's the point of the hiring though. I'll disagree
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:25.980]   I think that was the whole point of the hiring of journalists. We're not we're not on facebook's rear end all the time
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:28.300]   I don't think they want to hire this at all
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:31.900]   Uh, they're doing the facebook journalism project woman on you care does a brilliant job with that
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:35.740]   They hired cambo brown. She's working with fidget simo the header product to tell
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:38.060]   Uh media companies a lot more about what they're doing
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:41.900]   Uh, they invested in nii. This is all I think very good stuff
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.140]   So they do care about what journals think is not
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:48.780]   She is not from my understanding and you're closer to this than I am
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:54.380]   But she is internally facing not externally. So she is not dealing with journalists
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:17:00.860]   She's dealing with how journalists see things on facebook internally and trying to explain to them things correct
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:07.260]   What's going to happen? So that was my point is people are going to say gee the next time facebook isn't transparent when it should be
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:10.860]   They're going to come back to this and say well say didn't do any good
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:15.260]   Or what those two nasty articles said nasty in the headlines at least
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:19.820]   Was facebook doesn't care about transparency. They're just doing this to say they care about transparency
[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:21.820]   And I think that's too cynical. I think it's wrong. I think it's
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:24.460]   Really
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:26.460]   Yeah, then they would hire someone who's really amazing
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:31.340]   As opposed to a laughing stock for all journalists if they that's the point that they're trying to be
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:35.740]   Okay, I don't think this is a deliberate attempt to hire someone who wasn't amazing
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:40.460]   I think it was it was that they weren't out of their shell enough to talk to people to find out what the reaction would be
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.420]   Uh, okay, I can say that
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:46.060]   You
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:52.220]   If you're lispy, I don't know if she's on the job yet, but if you're lispy and you're on the job and you read cashmere hill's article at
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:58.540]   Facebook should be more transparent. How did it by the way that it was quite a stretch the
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:02.060]   Person that was recommended to cashmere hill
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:07.820]   Was her I think great aunt by marriage but had no other connection
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:10.380]   It wasn't like, you know, mostly when I get recommendations for facebook
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:14.220]   It's three other people you know know this person or whatever nobody
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:17.180]   There was no connection at all. Nobody
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:20.060]   She knew followed her
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:23.420]   She she wrote to the person person said yeah, I am related to you
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:29.260]   It's a it's a it's a really kind of spooky thing and and I think is often the case
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.380]   uh, it was it was a question
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:36.060]   Humans have an amazing ability to detect coincidence
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:43.260]   And then it's somehow built into us. I'm sure there's an evolutionary reason for it to a scribe
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:49.420]   Agency to coincidences to say aha yes false cause causality that kind of thing
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:57.020]   So but I have to say having read cashmere's article and knowing cashmere and really thinking she's very good. She's really good
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:01.820]   She's great. It is a little puzzling. How did how did Facebook know so
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:07.580]   If this would be the very first thing this paid might take on what would you do?
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:12.620]   I think I think you'd go reporting and try to and try to get to the expert side and try to do this
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:15.420]   Yeah, how did we find this say how could this happen?
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:19.660]   Yeah, uh, I've told the story on the show before of the of the journalist I talked to who
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:24.220]   Got his diagnosis of multiple sclerosis because he was sharing
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:27.980]   Symptoms he was feeling and somebody bought those
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:33.260]   Symptoms and an advertised joke, right? There are explanations of how these things can happen
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:37.660]   Uh technology lends itself to that. It's it's often such a black box
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:41.660]   Uh that we you know, we don't know and if we were shown how it happened it was you go
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:44.620]   Oh, yeah, I guess so because you do you hear all the time people say hey
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:48.140]   I was talking with a friend about uh, umbrellas and all of a sudden I got an umbrella ad
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:51.100]   That's a human brain. That's just the way the brain works
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:55.100]   You know you think about buying a car all you see is that car on the road all right?
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.900]   All of a
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:04.060]   Oh, go on. No, you say you go you go. Stay safe. No, fine was not mine was complaining. You go because you're gonna be additive
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:12.460]   Guys are damn polite. We are just because we we're self-spoken. Okay. We're very soft
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:17.820]   This kind of weird oh no more no more. So it bothers you and people talk like that
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.700]   It does. I don't like it. There's a name for that the botter mine-hoof phenomena
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:26.940]   No, I know bite or butter mine-hoof is the bite or mine-hoof gang
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:29.580]   the terrorist gang were they the ones who uh
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:36.140]   Turn remember what what terrible kidnapped and killed a executive civil sword or a government official
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:38.860]   So why is it called the botter mine-hoof?
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:47.100]   Because it was I think frow butter and hair mine-hoof. I can't remember the botter mine-hoof complex. This is so fascinating
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.220]   I was gonna say with uh
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.380]   Facebook and this is a film
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:55.740]   No, wait a minute
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:21:02.380]   All right, never mind. I'm sorry. Go ahead. You say something now because I've not had a certain certain ways that they were buying data from data brokers
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:07.660]   Which could make those correlations because you can see family and if that's
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:11.180]   If that was how it was done and it isn't a coincidence
[01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:17.500]   That's actually really creepy. Right. I would think I mean like they don't give facebook enough data
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.500]   It's got a bio the data about me too
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:24.300]   Yeah, and she called she called this woman who she found a great aunt by marriage
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:29.260]   uh, and and the reason it was far far fetched is because um
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:32.940]   Uh her let's see
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:37.340]   Her biological she never it's very southern gothic my biological grandfather's a man
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:40.380]   I never met with the last name porta or a band and my father when he was a baby
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:46.700]   My father was adopted by a man whose last name was hill the porter family grew up and lived in Ohio
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:51.420]   She you know she grew up in oh florida so she she'd known there were blood relatives out there
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:53.420]   But there's no reason to think I'd ever meet them
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:59.660]   Etc, etc, and and weirdly enough that she recognized she's a porter. That's I think that's I remember that name
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:03.420]   So she she couldn't figure out why she was showing up at her time like she called her
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.900]   She said are you related to my biological grandfather? Yes
[01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:07.980]   She said
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:12.300]   Uh, she is my great aunt by marriage. She's married to my biological grandfather's brother
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:16.300]   Met him 35 years ago the year after I was born facebook knew my family tree better
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:19.100]   Than I did they had a nice conversation
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:23.180]   I was grateful that faith-face for gonna give me the chance to talk to an unknown relation
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:28.140]   But odd and disconcerted by its apparent omniscience
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:30.620]   So
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:36.540]   I mean it's hard to even imagine what data broker they might have bought this from then this I could just very well be
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:41.340]   Well, I don't know how do you explain it? So that's Liz spades job now, right?
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:45.180]   Well, I don't we'll see what it is
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.820]   I
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:49.820]   Want that job
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:53.260]   Yeah, cashmere is is awesome. I have to say and
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:59.820]   You know she does the work. She will not she'll not let this down. I think we'll find out more
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:05.740]   I think she doesn't treat the whole privacy stuff from an emotional level. She treats it from a from a journalistic level. That's really makes
[01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:09.980]   It look like what's going on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so so so so so the
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:16.460]   What ties these three things together because the platforms aren't as self-aware as they should be
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:22.620]   In how people see them that leads to this kind of idiocy in the guardian. Let's nationalize them
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:27.020]   Yeah, and it and it goes too far and they've got to get smarter about this
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:30.460]   And and they've got to be more and they end they have to be more open
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:32.540]   That's the paradox of this they do it to be more transparent
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:38.940]   They do have to understand better how people react to what they do and recognize that they're open this and and they're trying things
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:44.780]   They're doing things, but then they just lose some steps. Yeah, and I don't know what happened in the google situation
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:50.060]   Um, but there should be transparency there to figure out what happened and if google did
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.700]   try to muscle
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:54.620]   Opinions against it to be shut up. They should talk
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:58.380]   Five hours ago, Anne-Marie slaughter put out a statement
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:01.260]   in response to this saying
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:03.660]   That I guess the quotes in twitter
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:08.140]   She said the quotes were taken out of context and then they put a statement up on the new america page
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:13.900]   That says they've been working with his dude to spin out the open markets effort and
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.460]   It sounded like a cover up to me
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:18.860]   It sounds
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:25.340]   She sounds like there are quotes where people said she said are you kidding? You're gonna lose us our biggest sponsor
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:28.140]   I mean there's right a little
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:32.300]   I don't know six minutes ago kennith vogel who wrote a d york times story
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:37.980]   Anne-Marie tweeted this story his false new york times story will issue statement proudly shortly
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.140]   We're proud of the open markets work
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:45.740]   Then kennith vogel the new york times reporter said I asked do america to ID any alleged errors in my story several hours ago
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:49.260]   They've yet to do so. Yeah, please ID the errors or correct this tweet
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:56.540]   So we're gonna get a he said she said across this uh the thing to do got god if you've learned google new america
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:59.500]   uh open markets
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:00.700]   reveal
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:05.660]   But I have said even if this story is exactly factually true and I don't doubt that it is
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:09.900]   It doesn't necessarily implicate google. It could simply be
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:13.420]   That's what i'm saying the director of the think tank thinking
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:18.540]   This happens pre-altered time preemptively. We have to bend over backwards for instance
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:25.100]   Our show host know who our advertisers are they need to so that they can be proactive and disclaiming the relationship
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:32.060]   But what I have to really kind of overemphasize is that should not have a chilling effect on your coverage
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:37.340]   So we don't ever say to our you know our hosts. Oh, you can't say something bad
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:41.340]   I didn't say that to you stacy when you started slam one of our sponsors
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:43.420]   but
[01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:48.060]   I can't promise that stacy hasn't have it in her head. Oh, I better not say anything bad about ring doorbells
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:52.620]   Exactly. Well, I listen. Let me hope you know that you can say bad things about ring doorbell stacy
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:59.260]   And we I mean we so in the newsroom in various newsrooms that I've been we have joked about
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:02.860]   Oh, this story is gonna kill that sponsorship
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:10.940]   And I mean and that is that is not an uncommon thing to say we still run the story. Yeah, but you still do this story. Yeah
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:13.580]   Yeah
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:19.180]   I said I had to think three times about about the facebook thing because on the one hand
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:21.180]   uh
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:25.820]   What happened in the end? I was gonna post about it, but I waited so long it wasn't newsroom anymore. So I didn't
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.900]   but on the one hand
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:30.860]   Um, I probably would have said something about it as i'm saying right now
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:34.700]   Uh, this is the first chance to do so on this show
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:38.620]   Uh, but if I don't do people wonder well jarvuses, you know
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:44.620]   It's chilly himself because he's not criticizing facebook when he otherwise would it's a situation where we're in and the only answer is transparency
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:47.180]   Uh to some level
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:48.860]   Yeah
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:50.860]   Yeah
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:53.340]   So that's why I was uh, we talked about this
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:56.860]   Criminal google or one way or the other. No, we don't know we just don't know
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:59.340]   I could see a case where eric spits says
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:02.060]   That's that story stupid and wrong
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:06.620]   And then someone preemptively goes and and and that means but that still means that
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:09.820]   And I think it's exactly where you have to be aware of their right
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:13.980]   Uh, if that's all that happened even so then you always have to do the caveat
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.940]   Don't do anything as i'm saying this i'm just expressing an opinion which I can do
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:21.500]   I think i've got stories full of crap, but but uh, you know, it should exist
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:27.340]   Yes
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:31.740]   Hey, do you know google home is going to be built into vacuum cleaners appliances
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:36.940]   Even more weirdly that cortana is going to be built into amazon echo
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:38.780]   I know
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:43.660]   That is that is just baffling we talked a lot about it on windows weekly and the consensus
[01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:49.500]   Now here's now i'd be curious what you think about this dacey both uh both of our hosts mary joe foley
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:52.620]   and paul tharrat said well, that's because
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:59.500]   Amazon and microsoft are also rans in this that in fact, it's google
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:03.020]   And apple that dominate the intelligent, you know voice
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.860]   assistance
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:09.340]   And that be google and micros it's the it's you know, it's like sprinting t mobile uniting
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:12.620]   It's the it's the also rans that are trying to compete with the big guys
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:19.580]   I said, I don't feel like amazon echo is it is it also ran? I feel like it's the leader in this so it's a leader in market
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.940]   It's an also ran in actual intelligence. It's like
[01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:29.900]   It's like the dumb jock right it's everybody loves them, but oh you haven't touched the syria much lately. Have you?
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:36.220]   Well syria okay, so i don't understand why syria is even a contender except for she talked about dumb
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.220]   She's dumb dumb
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:41.980]   Although apple home kids getting better. Um, we can talk about that on another show
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:45.580]   Google is very smart. I'll grant you that it's the smartest of the bunch
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:48.380]   In microsoft doesn't have a market
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:52.780]   They they just don't have an in road into the home because they don't have any devices really
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:55.340]   Harman carden is going to make the first standalone
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:29:01.020]   Cortana device, but right now it's on your desktop and your phone if you install the Cortana app
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:06.860]   Yeah, so this it is in a way it is kind of a match made in in heaven. I guess I
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:11.020]   Don't really know. I mean it's an awkward interface. That's made in the basement
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:14.940]   Yeah, it's like tie in the two bricks together and see enough
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:17.500]   Or
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.660]   Don't make an eagle. I think it was a
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:22.300]   I
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:25.420]   So here bay the funny thing is that the person on us is with jeff bezos
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:28.860]   And bezos said something I thought was quite interesting
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:34.060]   Which is I imagine a day where you'll have a variety of these with each with different skill sets and abilities
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:38.620]   And just like you'd have a group of friends you talked to whoever you you know you need help from
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:41.500]   And it makes you want one device. No
[01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:50.380]   Of course he does. Oh one device different names what he's doing. So you would say to echo echo open cortana
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:53.980]   And then because it's I guess it's like a skill and then cortana
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:30:00.700]   Then it was say okay. I'm cortana. What can I do would you and then you could say do things that are specific to cortana?
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:06.940]   Cortana is very good with microsoft things you wouldn't say what's the weather because you could have just asked the echo for the weather
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:11.180]   But you might say add stacey to my outlook calendar for july 5th
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:16.380]   That's so g e appliances actually has an assistant called janeva. Oh, janeva is
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:20.780]   Geneva is an echo skill. Okay, that you say
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:23.820]   hey madam a
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:27.100]   ask janeva to preheat the oven and then
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:34.620]   Asking janeva and eventually what they want to do is janeva wants to know what you're cooking and you'll say i'm cooking a pot roast
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:40.460]   Geneva recommends doing it at this or ask janeva to start the dishwasher or to do the laundry
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:45.660]   So what they're trying to do and this makes total sense if you're a brand
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:51.740]   You want to have a brand and an identity in this world where we're going to be talking to computers
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:53.100]   And if you don't
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:58.060]   You're going to be left in a lurch because you're also going to have to mark the hell out of reminding people to
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:00.940]   Ask for your brand. It's like it's like the app problem on phones
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:05.020]   And I wrote about this like god like a year ago saying
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:10.780]   I do not want to have to sit and remember who I ask for very like
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:14.380]   But you know what you wouldn't mind being able to say to the echo
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:20.380]   Tell janeva to heat up to 450 degrees and start toasting some toast in my june oven
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:22.860]   That would make perfect sense
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:24.860]   but I'd rather
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:30.940]   Madam a turn on my oven. I don't give a hoot what the name of the
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:37.340]   I mean like i've got i've got a boss oven. I've got a june oven. I've got, you know, a samson
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:41.340]   No, what you're going to do is you're going to say june uh, what?
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:44.140]   What should I cook tonight?
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:48.780]   Let me ask echo. Hey echo. What should stacy cook tonight?
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:51.740]   I don't know about that. I'll get back to you
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:54.860]   Amazon is going to be able to tell me what to cook tonight
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:58.540]   And I can't wait for that day to come because Amazon's going to get all my grocery orders
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.780]   Now that it's got grocery stuff and I'm going to be
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:04.700]   You would have three eggs and a chicken left. Yeah, and a chicken
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:08.220]   I suggest mother and child reunion
[01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:15.660]   Are you using your june oven l'o? Yeah, you want to see my instant replay all I do is cook toast
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:17.580]   really?
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.020]   pretty much
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:21.020]   I
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:23.020]   They just added a
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:26.940]   Well, there's a grill. See I would use that because I do the sous vide I need something
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:30.220]   Just to grill stuff, you know, just a quick link they have a they have a
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:34.060]   hamburger preset now that looks really tasty, but I haven't had
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:35.900]   meat
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:38.060]   We we use the june to cook salmon
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:41.980]   The other night and we used it to cook broccoli the broccoli is the best
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:47.740]   How do you are you bro? You bake broccoli you like roasted holy no how you never put your broccoli in the june?
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:51.180]   No, I've done cauliflower though. That's probably very similar shop your broccoli
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:54.460]   Yeah, that's me chopping broccoli right there. Yeah, chop and broccoli a little olive oil
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:56.860]   Yeah, shove it in there. It's already a preset
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:33:00.140]   Yeah, and oh my god. It is the best roast broccoli ever
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:04.380]   I do not know why but it is quite tasty you put a little garlic in there or just the olive oil
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:09.500]   Oh, yeah, but you know why sister-in-law went to Israel brought me back this dead sea salt with garlic and rosemary. Oh
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:12.220]   Oh, yeah, it's good
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:15.900]   Where's my cooking show? That's everything strudel in your june
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:20.140]   Well, I have not done it. You should do it on facebook
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:26.140]   Oh, that's it cooking with stasis. He cooks no, and you should do it on this on this network right here this here now
[01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:31.660]   It's either I'm making him jealous. That's good. No, no do it on a facebook thing. All right. I'm in practice. Okay. Go ahead
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:32.620]   Oh, sorry
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:36.700]   No, I was gonna ask Jeff's opinion about the vogue stuff, but you talk about your stuff because I don't know if we're gonna
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:41.020]   Go he was gonna do a june. I'll be nothing. No, I was I don't even have any ads today. So go ahead
[01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:43.100]   What's the vogue stuff what happened?
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:46.300]   I don't know they hate us. It disturbs me. They hate us
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:50.620]   You want me to give you I'll give you a dollar and I'll run an ad for going bankrupt
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:55.420]   We're going bankrupt right now right here right in front of you. No, I know everybody's watching
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:34:02.620]   Uh people will go up their phones. I've been practicing this all day. It is a musically oh dara
[01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:05.020]   costro shahi
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.220]   Oh
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:09.340]   Close that's pretty good. Dara costro shahi. I don't know either
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:12.620]   Dara costro shahi what I always say
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:18.300]   Is if the name comes from a non-Arab a language with a non-Arabic non uh
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.420]   western alphabet
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:24.220]   Then it's almost always exactly as spelled
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:27.580]   Because it's transliterate because it's a transliteration
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:33.340]   Yeah, it doesn't work with chinese because but that's another matter, but it works with uh names from india
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:35.340]   It works with names from um
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:36.860]   Iran
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:42.300]   Yeah, asi Arabic names. It's pretty much anyway. I don't know where dara is from dara costro shahi
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:45.180]   But i'm assuming that every letter thank you
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:48.140]   every
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:50.620]   Every time I say his name, I want a little thing like that
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:55.580]   No, that's that's the macho way to do hate
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:35:00.620]   Dara costro shahi is the new ceo of uber
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:07.020]   Oh wait. Hey, who who who is the new ceo of uber? Oh, let's see what she says
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:11.260]   Sorry, I don't know how to help with that yet. Oh shut up
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:14.220]   Ask your echo. Anybody have an echo
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:17.340]   Mine's not near me. Yeah
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:18.860]   They fight
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:23.900]   I decided I don't care how he pronounces it. I'm calling him dara costro shahi because I pronounce it
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:25.980]   I think it's actually dara dara
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:27.020]   So
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:31.900]   When when the news came out on sunday, I was at a friend of mine her house and she used to work
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:37.180]   Very briefly with him and she was like dara is going to be the ceo of uber
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:42.540]   And there was much drama, but we did not I did not ask the last name pronunciation
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:44.780]   It was a missed opportunity of mine and i'm sorry
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:51.420]   Well, she who knows if she's singing right let me i'm going. How do you pronounce she knows him in person
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:54.940]   Here here. She knows him a person doesn't mean anything
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:57.740]   Let's see how to pronounce
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:03.100]   You know, it's amazing. There is a youtube video on everything dara costro shahi
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:10.140]   Costro shahi dara costro shahi. Thank you dara. That is a youtube video dara costro shahi
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:12.940]   Somebody made somebody has a video bless
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:16.060]   I'm telling you youtube's got everything man
[01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:18.300]   Anyway
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.100]   Great article by ben tomsen on strateccary
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:25.100]   We are endeavoring to get ben on one of our shows soon
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:29.580]   To talk about it. He says dara very good choice
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:33.660]   um costro shahi used to be the ceo of expedia
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:41.900]   And went and he was a before that the cfo so he comes from the finance side. He's not a techie necessarily he's a finance guy
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:48.220]   And ben says that bodes very well for uber, especially the challenges uber's facing
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:53.420]   Uh, he calls him very successful very stable and very well compensated
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:59.500]   Uh, he I think his uh, I think i'm trying to remember. I think they said something like 200 million
[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.500]   dollar golden parachute or
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:05.260]   As he he makes 95 million dollars a year at expedius
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:08.140]   Wow
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:12.300]   And I do believe that he's gonna get a couple of hundred million
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:14.140]   um
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:20.380]   Cara swisher said carat had this she had she had the uh tweets hearing uh from the um
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:24.780]   Heating to the board room air doc. We're going to you're kidding
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:28.140]   Well, no, that was there was a layer. I mean, no, she wasn't
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:31.980]   Okay, okay, that part was a joke, but I think she she had a good information
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:36.940]   I see I think she said one of them like can we run here that berry diller was negotiating on his behalf for the board
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:43.820]   He gave a presentation to the board as I guess all the candidates did I didn't even know that uh and
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:48.300]   In the presentation there was a slide and everybody was quite impressed that says
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:52.220]   Don't call me. I'll call you to the board
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:57.580]   Cara writes it was the best part of his presentation bid to become ceo of uber
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.860]   What he meant was I don't want to hear from the board
[01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:06.780]   I'll ask you if I want advice that probably is the best advice the board has been very
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.860]   very bad
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:13.500]   In this whole process there apparently was a lot of infighting over either meg witman
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:17.740]   Or jeff emelt the ceo of uh of ge meg
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:21.260]   Witman wanted it badly apparently was lobbying for it
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:23.340]   But uh cara
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:29.020]   Poise she had the scoop on this wasn't she she's she's I think she stopped covering yahoo and moved to uber
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.020]   Which is a good choice cara
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:33.260]   She said that there was a mysterious third candidate
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:37.820]   We were talking about this sunday because we we knew the board was meeting during twit and we were waiting to hear
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:41.020]   Shortly after twit they asked kosra shahi
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:44.060]   so his uh skill
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:49.740]   Moving really rebuilding expedient which was struggling when he took over
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:54.780]   And changing their model from a wholesale model to an agency model
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:58.700]   I didn't even know that they you know, I had to read all this and try to understand it before I
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:05.820]   Uh, you know could understand ben's article but ben said this is exactly the kind of guy you need because he rebuilt
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:09.820]   Expedia from the ground up. He didn't do the easy thing
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:18.540]   He did the hard truth. That's true. He did expedient did need to be rebuilt and he did rebuild it. Yeah, that's really interesting. Uh, so
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:25.820]   It's actually remember yahoo. I think actually getting a financial wizard into yahoo remember yahoo. Sorry. That was kind of a true
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:37.260]   But this was their problem they hired a product person instead of a financial person and I think a lot of tech silicon valley companies tech
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:42.060]   This was a good move for precisely the reasons ben outlives and because
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:45.660]   At a certain point in time
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:51.580]   You've created a product and now you've got to understand how you disrupted the market from my financial perspective
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:59.180]   And doubled down on that and that's where I think netflix is going to succeed or fail with its content play. Did it make the right bet?
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:03.580]   Um with its its content strategy. So I just thought that was
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:09.900]   Kind of there are parallels we see often in uber actually if they recognize this they made the right decision
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:16.460]   Ben says it's clear that kosra shahi has demonstrated the patience and resolved to fix problems
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:24.380]   At their root and as this year has made clear uber's culture needs a fundamental reworking not simply a fresh coat of paint
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:31.100]   kosra shahi seems an ideal candidate's take on the problem at a fundamental level and has already shown an expedient he's willing to walk the walk
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:34.380]   on issues of sexism in particular
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:38.300]   So uh in the end the board which has been really
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:45.740]   Problematic did the right thing and hired probably it's I agree with ben the right person
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:51.980]   For the job and we'll see of course what he does with uber. There's a lot of value in uber. There's no question about that
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:55.660]   Um, he said so well the cfo left a few months ago
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:57.660]   He said
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:59.660]   He was worried
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:06.940]   Ben when ben learned that uber for instance couldn't say at any any point in time how much it was paying drivers and bonuses
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:12.060]   It didn't have a way to accurately calculate the amount of bonuses that uber paid to drivers
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:16.300]   As I noted in a daily update at the time ben writes this is staggering
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:20.940]   uber cannot measure the single most important factor in its profitability
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:23.580]   On something approaching a real time basis
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:28.860]   The implication of this lack of tracking is that uber may not have a clear picture as to what its unit costs are
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:32.780]   But and this is where I went to least since it what the hell's he time
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:41.900]   Explain balance sheets to me a canyon. So but he I think ben saying there's a real that uber is real strength is
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:44.540]   is in its uh
[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:46.540]   Is it's um
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:52.300]   You keep not to focus on drivers, but let me see if I can find it because i'm going to misstate it
[01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:59.500]   The ubers use of the bonus driver with drivers has the whiff of expedius using the merchant model
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:04.140]   Which is what goose coaster shahi changed it makes sense in the short term?
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:07.820]   But it ignores the long term value of having less friction
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:13.340]   For suppliers to come on board the part-time drivers that overwhelmingly favor lift
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:19.180]   So this is uh, he says what does this mean? What what what changed is this portend?
[01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:23.580]   Uh, well for one thing getting the financial reporting in order
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:28.700]   Having the information that you of course you're gonna have to have the right strategy
[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:33.260]   But having information first if you don't have the information you can't create a proper strategy
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:37.340]   but ben says that uh that there's a virtuous cycle
[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:40.060]   with uh with riders
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:48.380]   uber wins not by monopolizing drivers, but by monopolizing riders in other words focus on the demand side not the supply side
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:53.420]   Optimizing for demand would suggest giving draggers a bigger cut of each ride such that marginal drivers
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:56.220]   Are encouraged to come back on the network and improve liquidity?
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.780]   his point is that
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:42:59.740]   if
[01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:04.220]   The best customer experience is going to make more drivers will come to you because they're going to get more work
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:08.620]   Because that's yeah, that's right. It's concentrated on the drivers. No you concentrate on
[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:11.740]   It's concentrated. Yeah, it's it's going instead of looking
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:15.420]   You're looking where the money is and the money is in the hands of the consumers
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:19.340]   So if you're a good driver the drivers will follow the money
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:21.900]   If there's the demand the supply will follow
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:25.740]   What's that phrase? Where why do you rob banks because that's where the money is?
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:28.780]   Why do you drive every time i take it over or over?
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:31.740]   Yeah, every time i take it over to the left i ask the drivers
[01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:34.860]   It's just so many states you can't do or i guess you can now can't you?
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:39.900]   I can now we actually have really good conversations in austin about that because nobody rides
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:45.740]   We got lift an uber back and nobody uses the other apps now so really when you talked
[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:48.060]   Yeah, when you talk to those drivers, they're like
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:49.660]   You know
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:55.580]   Like what platforms do you get your rides from and they're like oh uber and lift i couldn't drive if i were doing right austin
[01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:57.020]   See so it's
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:00.860]   And it wasn't really uber's gonna beat lift you have to you want to get them to say the same thing
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:06.540]   Ben writes in fact what makes uber so valuable and still attracted despite all the recent troubles is its position with riders
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:12.460]   The more riders uber has the more drivers it will attract even if the economics are worse relative to other services
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:15.980]   Driving at a worse rate is better than not driving at a better one
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:22.300]   Given the choice i ride lift because of the reputation of uber
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:26.460]   And drivers i talk to tend to prefer lift same reason
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:31.420]   So culture at first it's not just the finances it's culture that will only work though jeff
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:37.900]   If you can get a lift ride as fast as you get an uber ride, but if you start looking at that app and your lift ride is a half an hour
[01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:43.260]   Often there's a four minute away uber driver you're gonna take uber i agree. That's how they win
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:49.180]   But the reason the the drivers go or go and lift the reason the reason that the
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:53.580]   Riders are going to left i think it was because of uber's or renders reputation
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:58.860]   Right, but they'll only you'll only inconvenience yourself so much right that's
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:05.740]   The single best this is what ben writes the single biggest factor that differentiates multi billion dollar companies is a scale
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:12.940]   I had to really think about this a scalable advantage in customer acquisition costs uber has a media lesson
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:17.340]   Yeah, it is a media lesson, isn't it? It is it is it's an everything i mean
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:23.020]   It's business today. It's everything it's called back to the previous point about about the voice platforms
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:24.940]   If
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:28.540]   The cost of getting someone to remember to ask for katana
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:33.660]   Right, so there's there's going to be a marketing cost right we're trying to get people to do that
[01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:37.340]   And that's a subscriber acquisition cost you know magazine when i was in the magazine business
[01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:42.460]   I I always wow the students with this you know i go through the economics of a magazine
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:49.500]   If you have a fancy katana s magazine like traveler in the day when it was thick it would cost five six bucks to print and distribute
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:52.460]   Um, so six bucks time is 12 is what?
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:55.740]   72
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:57.740]   right and then
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:45:59.500]   Um
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:02.940]   We would it would cost anywhere from round numbers
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:09.020]   15 to 30 bucks in marketing as a subscriber acquisition cost so you're now out a hundred bucks
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:12.060]   What are you charged for this conversion dollar a copy?
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:17.660]   Basic rake you're getting 12 bucks. So you're out 88 bucks yikes
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:24.940]   Uh, but obviously the advertising was so rich. That's what that's the how the economics of american magazines worked for years is no longer
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:29.900]   It's you know what's interesting is the podcast model similar because it every listener costs us money
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:36.060]   Yes, i'm apparently doing a crappy job. Well, how do you who pays for your downloads?
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:42.540]   I do I i'm on libson so so okay libson's unusual
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:46.300]   They don't charge you for downloads. They charge you for storage unless they've changed the model
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:51.180]   No, they charge me to just host it so right but they don't so if you had a million viewers
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.740]   Or 10 viewers who would cost you the same
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.420]   Right
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:58.220]   See that's breaking that model because the truth is
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:01.100]   libson's hiding it from you
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:03.580]   But but every download is what costs money
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:07.820]   As i say, I know how the internet works. Yeah, so so libson
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:11.260]   Because of their business model hides that from you
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:16.860]   But in fact, we're also probably being subsidized by well subsidies always confuse things
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:18.700]   so
[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:22.860]   But the real cost of the podcast is much like the magazine cost which is
[01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:25.660]   everybody who listens costs you money so
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:31.340]   They're all of the same issues kind of in a smaller scale but all the same issues for instance magazine's tightly control circulation
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:34.380]   You don't want to have suddenly five million readers you'd break the bank
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:37.260]   Because you'd have to print five million
[01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:41.900]   You want readers for multiple readers per copy, you know, once i've been subscribed right?
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:43.580]   Right, right
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:48.540]   When i started ew, they be they begged and begged and begged and said can't this be bi-weekly?
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:50.940]   Can't this please be bi-weekly? I said no
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:56.460]   There's no sense it doesn't work. Yeah, because the the physical cost of the past will be much
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:59.260]   well and and
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:02.220]   The amount of circravity you can get it about the same right
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:04.700]   Exactly
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:08.780]   Yeah, exactly anyway, but see libson kind of hides it so i don't know
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:12.220]   I guess you don't have to worry about it. So that's a good thing
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:19.260]   So this is the same thing as youtube by the way you google eats the cost of the downloads so you don't have to worry about it
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:24.060]   Yeah, i think libson also the the pay so what people who get?
[01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:31.340]   600 downloads versus what i pay for my 25 000 downloads are very
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:37.500]   Like oh you do pay for downloads then as no, sorry. I don't what libson pays so
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.740]   Yes, people who only get downloaded 600
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.900]   You're costing libson a lot more money. Yeah
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:48.380]   Right, but they're making it up on people with their other podcasts the vanity podcast because there's lots of shows that don't
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:56.940]   Do any I mean they just they have a very small audience. I have a small audience. Right, but so how much do you see advertising for uber and lift?
[01:48:59.260 --> 01:49:02.380]   How much do I see a lot that's interesting
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:07.340]   Because you're because you just said this is right the writer acquisition cost because right search and cost
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:09.580]   Well, so
[01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:11.580]   Cost
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:14.620]   How do they get what you're asking how do they get more brighter? Yes, yeah
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:17.500]   I think it includes things like thinking about
[01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:22.460]   I was gonna say latency, but how long someone's waiting it's app development costs
[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:26.140]   Yeah, but it says uber ad for well. Yeah uber advertises
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:31.100]   They do they send out emails to people like go take a ride here's ice cream stuff
[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:33.900]   What I'm saying is they're gonna hit a point
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:36.860]   Where they're gonna have to start marketing?
[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:41.740]   Well, it's not just customer acquisition costs. He's arguing about the whole customer experience
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:45.100]   Right. So they spend a lot of which is a cost which is a marketing cost business
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:48.060]   Okay
[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:53.100]   So jim beam is giving away 10 000 uber rides in chicago for the world series
[01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:58.060]   That's an interest say I think uber wants to do kind of more or less traditional marketing, right?
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:49:59.020]   So
[01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:03.980]   If you think about it, this is a great I don't know how much they paid jim beam or maybe they just gave them free rides
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:08.860]   But those 10 000 people may many of them may be taking their first uber ride
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:13.900]   And that's a one way to get customers. Oh, this was pretty nice. It was a lot better than a cab
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:21.500]   That's an acquisition cost. Yes. Yes, that's sorry. You know kind of marketing thing advertising. They're doing it's just a little non standard
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:26.220]   We had a four free issue offer, which is very common and and
[01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:29.260]   It's acquisition cost
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:35.580]   Right. Oh, you're on the newsstand. Right. You have more copies you want lots of copies there. So the the the the waste is acquisition
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:37.580]   Right. Right
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:39.820]   Oh
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:43.100]   All right. We're born leo dara cost
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:50.060]   Wait, I did want to ask jeff's opinion about this google home vogue thing because it to me
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:52.780]   You're always talking about new ways of telling stories
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:59.660]   This does not seem quite like total storytelling, but if you see why don't you describe it to our to our audience?
[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:06.700]   So vogue signed a partnership with google and now you can ask your google home to talk to vogue
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:14.700]   And then you can do things like ask what was the interviewee like or you know, where were they going behind the scenes?
[01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:19.580]   Yeah, and I I thought that was kind of an interesting way to add to
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:23.340]   an existing story or article and
[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:25.980]   But maybe it's just gimmicky. I don't know
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:32.780]   Yeah, I don't know there. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go back to butterfly effect and custom porn
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:34.940]   Oh, um
[01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:36.460]   because
[01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:39.980]   Because what really struck me is is this idea that
[01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:45.820]   Um, it's special that we're storytellers that makes us special. You can only get stories from us
[01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:47.340]   No
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:51.500]   Everybody can make stories now. Everybody can buy stories. They want for themselves now
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:57.340]   Every company can build stories now. So I don't know that that's the that that's what I expect from
[01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:00.220]   a voice conversation
[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:04.940]   Um, is that it's about it's too media centric. It's in general. We always we're always media center
[01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:08.540]   We always think you want to know more about us. We should want to know more about you
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:13.660]   And that's the opportunity is to hear what people are asking and then to answer that so I don't know
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:16.220]   I'll I'll wait and see i'll keep it on my but I don't know
[01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:18.540]   who pays for
[01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:21.900]   The vogue behind the scenes content on the google home
[01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:27.420]   That i'm not sure if I assume it's vogue who built something because you'd have to build like a
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:33.980]   What are they called? Yeah, but it's not a skill. It's so but does does vogue pay google or does google
[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:36.700]   Pay vote or do they give it away?
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:42.300]   I'll bet it's by the one school. I bet they're working together. So I guess the way it works
[01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:49.420]   In the first campaign of its kind readers will be able to ask the assistant on google home for more information on five articles
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:52.540]   Interesting google home. It does not work on the regular assistant
[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:56.700]   Once it's prompted with the question the writers behind the piece will share personal tidbits
[01:52:56.700 --> 01:53:01.660]   From their celebrity sit downs including some funny anecdotes first up on our list
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:06.860]   Did jennifer lance finish that bottle of old granddad bert burbin? Let me ask
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:12.380]   I gotta turn on my sound here on my google assistant
[01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:19.420]   Did jennifer lance finish that bottle of old granddad burbin?
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:24.540]   You got to talk to vogue first. These are the top results. Yeah, it didn't do it
[01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:28.620]   You have to ask it to talk to vogue. Oh
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:32.540]   Talk to vogue
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:36.940]   Hi, this is vogue
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:41.260]   Hi, this is vogue's cloymel and welcome to the vogue september issue
[01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:47.820]   We've partnered with google home to bring you exclusive behind the scenes material from our editors and writers about some of the stories
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:53.020]   They've created just look out for the google home callouts at the end of select articles to learn more
[01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:57.740]   Oh, that's like barcodes. That's like huge cats like the cute cat jennifer lorance
[01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:03.260]   Oprah winfrey nichol kitman serena williams or megan kelly
[01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:06.780]   Yes
[01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:13.020]   I'm sorry. I didn't catch that would you like to hear about jennifer lorance?
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:15.580]   Oprah winfrey you've got to tell her one
[01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:18.540]   Sir me and we're good names or megan kelly
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:21.740]   jennifer lorance
[01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:25.740]   And there's all of us in a nutshell
[01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:28.460]   about jennifer lorance
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:33.820]   Was jennifer lorance like in person? I like thinking I didn't ask you that
[01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:38.700]   So you wanted to hear about megan kelly and what did you who did you want to hear about stacey?
[01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:41.020]   serita williams because she's awesome
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:43.500]   It does it's us in a nutshell
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:51.260]   I wanted a beautiful movie star you wanted the fox news personality and you wanted the tennis star
[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:54.300]   That's why we make a great team
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:55:00.460]   All right, well, have you heard that that's not going to be that useful. I don't think that's much
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:03.340]   I don't think it adds anything to go home
[01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:07.740]   Idiot centric I would guess you've taken enough of us. I would guess vogue paid them for that
[01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:10.140]   That would be my guess after hearing it
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:13.260]   Google has decided not to appeal the eu
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:15.580]   shopping decision, but in fact
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:18.700]   To try to find a way to comply
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:21.660]   So this does the oh does this cut off an appeal?
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:29.740]   I thought they had a deadline. I thought they had a deadline no matter what the company had 60 days to propose how it would stop
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:34.380]   its illegal content and 90 days to make changes on how that is place shopping results
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:42.380]   The obligation is fully google's responsibility said the european union and an emailed station as statement
[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:45.100]   uh, I thought the
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:48.300]   I don't think that cuts off. I think I think that's the requirement
[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:54.620]   Google has the option of challenging the fine and antitrust order to the eu courts which can take years to reach a final decision
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:59.980]   Next week's intel ruling will come some eight years after the eu fine
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:02.620]   This is the absurdity of this eight years
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:07.660]   So the eu now has a lot of doing wrong by the way. Do we remember what intel was doing wrong?
[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:13.020]   They were dumping intel said they had they were mystified as to what regulators wanted
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:18.940]   The company to do to comply with in order to hand and he called any competitive rebates for chip sales to computer makers
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:23.260]   So eight years later. They they got a 1.06 billion dollar
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:27.100]   Okay, they were really they were dumping all over and it was really really
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:30.460]   Yeah, they were like killing AMD on that one
[01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:32.300]   um
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:35.660]   The eu now has a month to check if google's plan changes will fit the bill
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:42.620]   Regulators are also expected to levy fines and separate investigations into google's android mobile phone software as well as
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:46.380]   Or possibly as soon as next month as well as the ad sense advertising service
[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:52.540]   Margarete vesta yar the eu antitrust chief has also threatened further probes
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:59.020]   If margarete vesta yar comes to you and says I have thas a probes I would like to do just run
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:02.220]   on travel or map services
[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:08.700]   So I guess it doesn't pre-clue to appeal. It's just their attempt to just can't we just get along
[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:13.580]   Yeah, if they didn't make any changes they could get fined up to five percent of gross
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:17.580]   Uh google spokeswoman said it's sharing that plan with regulators
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:24.780]   Before the deadline expires but declined to comment for this is the one with the 2.4 billion euro fine
[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:31.100]   Uh, but there's you know could you take years before that money's collected took eight years to get intel
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:37.500]   I would they not get I think they're still gonna get the fine no matter what right even if they comply
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:43.660]   They have to fine and they need to comply yes fine and they apply unless they went on appeal right
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:51.980]   All right, all right when I was I could see what google was actually gonna do what were the change because because this is so
[01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:54.700]   Everybody google just sent it to them
[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:56.140]   Then show I see them okay
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:58:02.220]   Because because it's it's still it's google shopping is not at the core of the world and google has plenty of competition
[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:05.900]   Program was on yeah, well if I were google I'd say okay. We'll shut it down
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:11.260]   How about exactly right fine fine? I'm shut it down
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:14.060]   um
[01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:21.260]   Trump's eight of trumps 32. I think cyber security advisors resign saying
[01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:24.860]   You're not doing anything
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:27.580]   insufficient attention to threats
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:30.140]   They were the whole over
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:32.140]   Stop talking. Thank you
[01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:35.260]   Trump's cyber when is that chrome thing coming out by the way?
[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:39.740]   I know the thing for this the video and then look what happens the video then pops up on the right
[01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:42.300]   By the way, I have more
[01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:44.300]   Routine that's really this is fortune
[01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:48.300]   the moral infrastructure of our nation reads the letters of the
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:52.460]   Of the people quitting their seven members resign from the 27 member council
[01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:58.300]   The moral infrastructure or nation is the foundation which our physical infrastructure has built the administration's actions
[01:58:58.300 --> 01:59:05.100]   Undermind that foundation the administration is not adequately attentive. This is more of more concerned to me
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:08.860]   Not adequately attentive to the pressing national security
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:15.500]   Matters within our purview are responsive to sound advice received from experts and advisors
[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:18.700]   including
[01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:20.700]   election systems, yeah
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:29.580]   Uh, people quit included former us chief data science dj petel former office of science and technology bossy chief of staff christen door gello
[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:37.740]   I you know, there's still 20 people on the council so I don't I don't know if the councils work will continue or if they'll just dissolve it as they did the other
[01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:43.020]   And councils advisory councils undermine the quote moral infrastructure
[01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:45.020]   Where is this coming from? Stop it
[01:59:45.020 --> 01:59:48.300]   I'm not talking to you fortune
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:51.980]   What are we gonna do? How can we as a as a nation?
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:54.780]   and the great
[01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:59.820]   urban carnage of pre of auto roll video and audio how can we end that?
[01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:01.980]   Uh
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:05.500]   Google could make it. I mean your browsers should just not make it
[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:11.660]   Says they are gonna add a capability in the next version of chrome to force silence
[02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:15.740]   It's I mean you have to do it after the fact
[02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:23.020]   I don't know if google says hey auto play video is going to impact your search. Oh, sorry shut up
[02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:32.780]   Then then people would it's the new podcast style. He just shut up and everything is talking at you
[02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:34.780]   Sorry
[02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:41.180]   Normally the home is not in here. How do I mute this again?
[02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:44.060]   There it is press that
[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:49.260]   Thing on the eyes. It just told me that it was that's awful. I muted. It's like the mic is muted. I'm now muted. By the way
[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:52.380]   power went out
[02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:58.060]   Google home is actually one of the nicer ones I had to unplug all the echoes because we were we were going to bed
[02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:00.860]   And when the power comes back on
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:06.860]   Yes, but the google home doesn't actually when it loses power and comes back on I don't think it talks to you
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:09.020]   No, it doesn't talk but it does a little
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:15.100]   Speaks very silent but I think it says would you like me to fold your sheets and shall
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:23.340]   Yes the echo and then if you have you know connected light bulbs they will pop right back on
[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:25.820]   But i'm here
[02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:27.500]   So
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:31.500]   All very exciting. I don't know what to think of this article on medium
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:37.100]   By Alexander muse yeah, I couldn't figure it out because it was it was so speculative
[02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:40.140]   How the nsc identified satoshi
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:47.180]   Nakamoto the creator or creators we've been here before haven't we yes many many times of bitcoin
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:50.460]   apparently
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:55.820]   The department of homeland security knows who satoshi is they won't confirm that they know his identity
[02:01:55.820 --> 02:02:00.860]   But despite these efforts according to my sources at the dhs
[02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:07.420]   Satoshi Nakamoto gave investigators the only tool they needed to find in his own words. They used something called steelometry
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:13.020]   Where you compare texts to determine the authorship of a particular work
[02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:22.220]   You know, I just heard a fascinating interview with the fbi profiler who helped find ted kazinsky the unibommer using the same technique
[02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:28.860]   And he talks about it and it it's this was on the occasion of the one of the networks has released a
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:35.100]   A mini series on this the unib fight has already or is coming up. It's coming up. I haven't seen it
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:36.380]   I don't know
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:41.340]   Through the years satoshi wrote thousands of post post and emails which are publicly available according to my source
[02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:47.500]   The nsa was able to use the writer invariant method of stellometry or steel ometries
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:51.660]   Delimetry to compare satoshi's known writings with trillions of writing samples
[02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:57.580]   And blah blah blah they put it in a 50 dimensional space they flatten them into a plane
[02:02:58.460 --> 02:03:00.460]   And now they got a fingerprint
[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:09.340]   Maybe it's made up it might be as made up as the other article I read which I don't know what to think of which says that google was founded by the cia
[02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:13.660]   In effect as a way to control
[02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:22.220]   I don't know something. Oh my god. I know Alexander. I know this guy the guy I wrote the satoshi thing. Yeah
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:25.500]   I was wondering it was like
[02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:29.660]   Is he is he reliable? He's an entrepreneur writing about whatever interests me. He says
[02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:34.780]   Yeah, he's definitely not following journalistic ethics. He's also a bit of
[02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:43.180]   Not quite like a troll provocateur, but he definitely is
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:45.820]   So but this isn't really that
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:47.660]   Provoking I'm
[02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:49.660]   Provocative provocative
[02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:56.060]   I'll tell you something that is more provocative and this guy is an investigative journalist the fees amed
[02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:59.420]   Who wrote how the cia made google?
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:04.860]   Inside the secret network behind mass surveillance endless warrants sky net
[02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:09.340]   Okay, that's a way to get now. This is two years old. So it already is nationalized
[02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:11.820]   It's already part of the government see no problem guardian
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:16.780]   This is two years old and I apologize for bringing it up, but I've been getting a lot of people asking me about it
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.700]   So it must have somehow
[02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:20.380]   come up
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:22.380]   I didn't see a lot of evidence
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:27.740]   You know the convincing evidence we know that the cia has a adventure capital fund
[02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:31.980]   And that they invested in facebook at least if not google
[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:35.580]   I don't know it's a story. There's a story
[02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:43.180]   So this guy actually did talk to somebody at the dhs perhaps but he's writing sorry. I'm going through his feed
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:44.620]   He's writing about
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:50.300]   A license plate monitoring which the eef actually it's a big deal in texas. So they talked about that
[02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:54.140]   Why is it was I have to do with Satoshi Nakamoto?
[02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:57.580]   Because he says after he wrote that story
[02:04:57.580 --> 02:05:04.940]   While I was writing my post on how the nsa identified Satoshi Nakamoto my source at the dhs described how the nsa
[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:09.900]   Subscribes to these private sources of license plate data to determine where you've been and where you are going
[02:05:11.260 --> 02:05:15.420]   So, but we kind of knew that was happening already or at least people who follow
[02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:17.580]   Surveillance
[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:19.420]   Everybody knows everything about me
[02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:23.740]   I'm Satoshi Nakamoto, okay
[02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:29.340]   There I feel much better. That would be perfect wouldn't that be funny
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:33.260]   Uh, but anybody looking at me knows no, you don't have the brains to do
[02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:36.140]   Stacy, I believe a lot sooner than you no offense
[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:41.340]   Sonos is apparently submitted to the FCC for approval
[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:44.540]   The thing you've all been waiting for Stacy
[02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:51.180]   It was unclear. I don't want to have to buy a new micro or a new speaker because because I have a lot of speakers
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:53.180]   That's the big problem people who hope
[02:05:53.180 --> 02:05:58.700]   If I can talk to the echo then I can tell the echo and then it'll control my speakers at worst
[02:05:58.700 --> 02:06:05.900]   Sell me a little plug-in device that will voice enable my existing sonos because I've spent as probably Stacy has thousands of dollars
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:08.540]   on sonos equipment over the years
[02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:14.460]   So that's what I'm hoping for if they make me buy a new speaker. That's a deal killer and I'm gonna be very enraged and raged
[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:20.700]   Like jeff. That's what this FCC filing is for a product model s13 that adds integrated voice control
[02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:23.500]   Functionality. Yes, but
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:29.900]   But that doesn't mean they can't do it on their old stuff. This is just in putting the echo into
[02:06:29.900 --> 02:06:35.820]   This is the other shoe the drops because a week ago sonos asked for
[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:41.660]   New permissions. They said you must update your software and give us new privacy
[02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:46.940]   Permissions or you won't be able to update in future and your sonos speaker will eventually stop working
[02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:49.660]   upsetting some people
[02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:56.620]   I don't know. I know I just want I want an echo enabled sonos. Is that so hard? Is that so very hard?
[02:06:56.620 --> 02:07:00.460]   You could make it with smart things
[02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:04.460]   I actually plugged my dot into my sonos speaker via the
[02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:11.340]   Oxjack and it kind of works. You have to have a lot of feedback. Oh, well move it farther away
[02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:19.420]   So yeah, no mine was mine. I did that a while back when the dot came out and I was dissatisfied with how that worked
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:27.020]   It doesn't you have to multi room audio is not so no it doesn't it doesn't even support stereo speakers is one one dot per speaker
[02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:29.260]   But at least it's a use
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:38.060]   It is a use what else we can we can wrap this up. We got a lot of good. Oh good because I just got a I just got a google alert with a recipe for potato salad
[02:07:38.060 --> 02:07:45.020]   And I'm hungry you like german style or picnic style americana. I you I like both
[02:07:45.020 --> 02:07:50.380]   I will eat a potato no matter how it's dressed. That's basically a potatoes are good
[02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:53.980]   Potatoes are delicious our potatoes and wheat
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:02.220]   Oh, yeah, yeah, I think so too. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah a lot of carbs
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:05.420]   But you know they got your vitamin A vitamin C in there. They'll be six
[02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:08.700]   It's good for you
[02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:13.100]   It's good for you. It's just and I have bacon fat which means my potatoes would even better
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:23.420]   What did you watch the hyperloop video? Yeah, you want to watch it again? Yeah, let's watch it mark watt knee
[02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:26.700]   Potatoes. Oh, I get it. I
[02:08:26.700 --> 02:08:32.140]   Sorry, John came over. Yes, when we started talking about potato salad and pointing his knee and I thought what's that all about?
[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:34.540]   And he says mark watt knee from the martian
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:40.140]   Potatoes remember he saved him somebody living on potatoes not salad just potatoes
[02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:44.940]   Um part of the reason we're talking about this is I had and we won't be able to air it
[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:48.620]   I'm unfortunately until November a great conversation this morning on triangulation with
[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:51.580]   The author of the martian andy we're oh, yeah
[02:08:52.140 --> 02:08:55.660]   You can't air until his new novel comes out. Oh November 4th 14th
[02:08:55.660 --> 02:09:01.020]   But i've read it. It's good Artemis. It's very good and it was a great interview with someone and he was so fun and a
[02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:08.140]   Accommodating you released a big preview of it. I know I don't you know, I don't well. I don't know do we have to hold it like that
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:13.660]   We have to hold it. We've been told by random if you agree to hold it you gotta hold it
[02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:19.900]   I asked him the only hates that the old's awful thing. I don't but that's why I don't do pre-release anything. I don't
[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:25.180]   Which is why by the way, I still don't have an essential phone or a galaxy note eight
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:29.740]   I'm watching all these youtubers show their reviews of the galaxy note eight
[02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:34.460]   Talking about the essential phone. I haven't received mine. I haven't even received a shipping date
[02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:40.460]   Even though I pre-ordered it and gave them money essential gave them almost a thousand bucks august 16th nothing
[02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:43.180]   Did you get dished?
[02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:45.020]   No, I did part of the essential fishing scam
[02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:49.420]   Yeah, I don't think that came from essential. I think somehow we still don't know
[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:52.700]   And essential says yeah, we're gonna we're working on this
[02:09:52.700 --> 02:10:00.220]   See I don't know if I agree with this verge headline in colossal screw up essential shared customers drivers licenses over email
[02:10:00.220 --> 02:10:02.540]   I don't think that's what happened
[02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:06.140]   I think what happened is somebody got some email addresses
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:10.700]   And sent a fishing scam to people saying if you want your essential phone
[02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:13.180]   You need to send us id
[02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:18.380]   So that we know it's you and people's responded, but it was everybody was CC'd
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:21.020]   I don't think it really came from essential
[02:10:21.020 --> 02:10:24.060]   Now
[02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:26.380]   People on Reddit say no, it's a misconfiguration
[02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:30.620]   I don't I don't know. I I guess I'll have to read that article because
[02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:33.900]   Essential says we're working on we're on it
[02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:39.660]   I have not received an email from essential saying you need to prove that you bought that it's you
[02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:45.900]   And I wouldn't respond. I'd say no, I want my money back. I'm not emailing you my driver's license. You knit wits
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:51.820]   Yeah, and you got my credit card and took a money. What more do you need?
[02:10:51.820 --> 02:10:56.780]   Everybody else will give me stuff even much more expensive stuff
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:11:00.940]   To the address on my credit card since that's where the money came from
[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:06.220]   Yeah, Leo if you want to give me your credit card just I'll send you all kinds of expensive stuff
[02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:08.140]   You see you see what I'm saying
[02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:11.660]   You don't need my driver's license to rip me. Oh, nevermind
[02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:15.500]   Yes, I don't so I I'm I'm unclear
[02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:18.860]   Deeter bone though knows what he's talking about. Let's see. This is
[02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:23.100]   From uh noon 1230 eastern. No, this is from this morning
[02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:26.380]   So I've been reading a lot of this stuff on on reddit and
[02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:29.820]   Reddit is notorious for getting stuff wrong. So
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:32.780]   I'm not gonna
[02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:35.900]   Uh a guy named schnell professor ron schnell
[02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:40.620]   Who was the cto of rand paul's presidential campaign? There you go
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:46.220]   Says it's not a fishing scam. It's a misconfiguration the dk id's check out in the report
[02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:51.580]   Supplies are actually going to essential and then many other people have accumulated quite a collection of collection of dls
[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:56.300]   Driver's licenses passports credit credit statements phone numbers and email addresses. This is unbelievable
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:59.500]   That's because it's a kind of everybody's CC'd it's a reply all
[02:11:59.500 --> 02:12:08.780]   So what appears to have happened according to deeter who knows what he's talking about is the essential at a list of customers
[02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:10.780]   It needed to verify to prevent fraud
[02:12:10.780 --> 02:12:12.780]   I'm apparently not on that list
[02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:17.260]   So it sent them an email requesting more information, but that email address was set up as a group email
[02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:22.380]   Do which meant reply sent to it went to everybody on the list
[02:12:22.380 --> 02:12:26.540]   It was a misconfigured customer support address on zendesk
[02:12:26.540 --> 02:12:30.620]   Uh overnight
[02:12:30.620 --> 02:12:34.060]   Customers inboxes were filled up with emails
[02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:39.020]   containing pictures of people there driver's licenses
[02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:44.140]   Oh, I want my money back if this is this if essential essential nearly says
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:46.860]   Uh, we've taken steps to mitigate
[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:50.540]   We've we're having looking into a recent email received by some customers
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:54.220]   We've taken steps to mitigate and we'll update with more info soon so far
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:58.380]   No other information. So maybe essential did screw up. That is pretty bad
[02:12:58.380 --> 02:13:03.420]   They tweeted five days ago that they were starting to ship out phones. I don't know anybody who's got one
[02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:08.300]   Except for people like marcus brown brown lane, you know famous people
[02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:14.540]   Mm-hmm. I don't care anymore. I got my note eight. I get my iPhone pro
[02:13:14.540 --> 02:13:17.260]   I got my pixel xl2
[02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:20.140]   No, I don't have any of those, but I'm gonna
[02:13:20.140 --> 02:13:24.060]   I don't really need an essential phone
[02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:30.700]   No, it is it not essential. It's unincential. Inessential. I wonder if I get my money back
[02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:33.980]   Uh, it was it out to reserve it
[02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:39.180]   No, I paid paid I bought it. I didn't ask for money to reserve, but then they said
[02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:41.420]   Oh, congratulations, you know
[02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:44.300]   Send just your money
[02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:46.300]   That was two weeks ago
[02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:50.700]   If you if it hasn't been delivered, it's possible you could even if they don't give you your money back
[02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:57.020]   You could take it up with your credit card provider. Yes, I know the only reason that we even mentioned this is because it's Andy Ruben's company
[02:13:57.020 --> 02:14:03.500]   He is the creator of android bought by google and worked at google and robotics before he left to create essential
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:07.340]   And it's also relevant to you stacy because he's gonna make a home automation device
[02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:09.740]   Maybe
[02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:15.100]   Yes, he talks about his whole idea. He did a great article with bloomberg or an interview with bloomberg
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:18.940]   Where he talks about his idea here is to get us to stop looking at our phones
[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:21.500]   And so one of the key elements
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:28.940]   Of that would have to be some sort of contextual awareness in from a home kind of device. So it makes a lot of sense
[02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:32.140]   I can't wait to see it. So there is a new zuckerberg
[02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:35.820]   August august
[02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:39.580]   Priscilla chan mark zuckerberg have a given
[02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:46.940]   Well, she Priscilla did the work mark was mark was present at the beginning have given birth to a second daughter august
[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:49.180]   zuckerberg
[02:14:49.180 --> 02:14:51.180]   And uh, mark's letter
[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:55.580]   Augie we think augie augie and max it's kind of cute
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:59.020]   That is so hipster
[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:05.180]   Rather than write about growing up mark writes to a newborn baby on facebook
[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:10.060]   We want to talk about childhood the world can be the world can be a serious place
[02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:18.220]   That's why it's important to make time to go outside and play. Oh my god
[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:21.420]   Oh my god
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:29.180]   It's cute. It's really sweet. It's kind of a shame. He's doing this in public, but okay. Fine. I guess he has to
[02:15:29.180 --> 02:15:32.620]   He has to that's his job. It's his job
[02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:36.540]   He signed up for it and so did august and max and Priscilla
[02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:42.860]   It's kind of like mine is getting angry in public. You know, they're gonna be incredibly wealthy
[02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:46.780]   But I don't think that makes up for the fact that they're going to have a fdup childhood
[02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:52.780]   Don't you think in the public eye and they they might not be in the public eye as much as I mean
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:58.700]   I mean look at look like a celebrity child. They were they were protected. I don't even know his name. Yeah, right jobs as kids
[02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:03.340]   Well, it's a one. Michael del's kids have been very protected. I mean Steve jobs
[02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:08.780]   People are trying to live in a normal house in a normal neighborhood. I mean they really try to give those kids a normal life
[02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:12.380]   Yeah, mark Zuckerberg owns every house around
[02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:17.900]   Because they didn't really want anybody nearby. So they just bought the whole neighborhood
[02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:20.780]   I don't know. Maybe it will. Oh mallec writes
[02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:25.180]   Congratulations mark and Priscilla and welcome to the world, baby august

[02:18:18.700 --> 02:18:23.660]   It's blogging a buzzed a tweet a tweet this week. It was very angry
[02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:28.540]   That there's someone who's invented bubble wrap that doesn't pop. Oh, that's what that's
[02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:32.940]   That's anti-social. That's anti-social. It is. It's just me
[02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:36.380]   Gosh, why would somebody do that? I know
[02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:41.020]   Is it sealed air isn't that the name of the company that owns bubble wrap
[02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:46.060]   I don't see it would even work if it doesn't pop. How would it work? How would it cushion a fall?
[02:18:46.060 --> 02:18:50.620]   It just because it cushions it it it flexes
[02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:58.540]   Okay, no more no more digressions. We have to get through this show because there's
[02:18:58.540 --> 02:19:01.180]   He wants to go home because Stacy's hungry
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:05.340]   I need food. I need alcohol. He wants potato salad
[02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:10.860]   My nests apparently thought I was no longer home and so it went to eco-mole aside to turn it
[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:13.260]   130 p.m. Pacific time
[02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:15.980]   430 eastern
[02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:20.060]   That'd be about 20 30 utc. I think I could really do it. I'm telling you
[02:19:20.060 --> 02:19:24.300]   I would stop here in the children fall asleep to this show anyway
[02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:31.020]   Already children fall asleep to show except when I get excited. Yeah, that's why you kick them. Oh, oh, you can't do that
[02:19:31.020 --> 02:19:33.020]   I am a bad person. I know wakes up children
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:36.460]   And you know rule number one do not wake up sleeping children
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:39.340]   Or dogs let sleeping children lie
