[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.360]   Great to be back, Leona.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.560]   Nice to see you, Gina.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.440]   I missed you guys.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.240]   I missed you too.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.960]   I need my glian chapotle and Gutenberg fixed.

[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.480]   I used to cry at the end.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.760]   Lassie, come back, Lassie.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.040]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.200]   I'm like a lost.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   Let me do a preview.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.400]   I guess you're about to announce.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   Yeah!
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.000]   Let me think.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Oh, it must be Lamar.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.720]   Lamar Wilson's here from Wilson Tech,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.200]   one the famous YouTuber, the funniest man in tech, Self Build.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   Self Build.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   I'm the more current events now, so it's kind of--
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.400]   I'm funniest man ever.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.200]   Ever?
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.480]   Hey, that's cool.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.320]   That's cool.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.560]   That's really good.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.200]   I'm the funniest looking man in tech.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.960]   Has that count?
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.120]   It does.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.120]   A screencap, then.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.840]   You don't have the screencap, but there'll be more.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.040]   Let me tell you.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.360]   Hey, boy, there's a lot to talk about.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.240]   I guess I'm going to have to apologize if I repeat,
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.600]   because I was in Norway for a vial.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.440]   By the way--
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.760]   Do you have any hearing?
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.760]   No, but you know what I had?
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.240]   We were in a little town called Christian Sund.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.400]   Not Christian Sand, but Christian Sund, which
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.760]   is on the west coast of Norway, right at the bend and the spoon.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.560]   And they're famous.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.640]   The whole town is founded on the--
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.720]   excuse me-- the clip-fisk industry.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.280]   My mouth is watering, talking about clip-fisk, which
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.160]   is short for cliff fish, which is a fish, a cod that
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.040]   is dried on the rocks of the cliff.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.640]   And you may know it better as bakalau or bakalau.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.200]   It's dried salted cod.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.240]   And it's fabulous.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.400]   So I had a lot of cod.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.920]   And one of the photographers there,
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   celebrity photographer Greg Gorman, went out and he caught--
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.760]   was it a cod, a fresh cod or a halibut?
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.160]   No, it was a mackerel.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.600]   And we had that one night.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   It was delicious as well.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.320]   So we had a lot of fish, fish soup, fish fish, fish fritters,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.800]   fried fish.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.320]   It's a kind of a fishy cuisine there in Norway.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.920]   And I loved every minute of it.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.600]   So thank you.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.880]   And we had such great hosts who were there, the folks
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.480]   at the Nordic Light Festival in Odinga.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.920]   I'm sure is watching.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.400]   He has a little cottage he goes to.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.560]   And he's got a whole twit man cave dedicated to the twit
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.880]   there.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.120]   And anyway, it was a blast.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.520]   Well, we're going to do two special twit photos from Norway.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.480]   Not next week, but the two weeks after.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.160]   Because it gives us a little time to edit this down,
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.120]   where we interviewed some of the most interesting best
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120]   photographers in the world.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.680]   I mean, just Bruce Davidson and Greg--
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.560]   I mean, just Greg Gorman.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.080]   The cast and crew are incredible.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.720]   Morton Korkwald.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.200]   I think I'm saying that right.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.520]   Korkwald.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.760]   Anyway, really fun.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.360]   So thanks to our hosts at the Nordic Light Festival in Christen
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.280]   Sund and everybody in Norway.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.120]   We did a boat.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.960]   So there's a boat, the Hetigruta boat, which
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.040]   goes from Christen Sund to Bergen.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.800]   And it's a really wonderful, beautiful,
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.920]   through the fjords that kind of go in and out like this,
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.200]   through the fjords going down.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.560]   It's incredible.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.640]   And then we're in Bergen, which is this beautiful, old city.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.720]   It's one of the historic cities of the world.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.440]   And then we took a train from Bergen
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.960]   through the middle of the spoon all the way to Oslo,
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.840]   like an eight-hour train trip that was just like snut.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   Like we're in the--
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.080]   well, in fact, we went through the town
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.000]   that they shot the Empire Strikes Back.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.360]   The ice planet Hoth is this town.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.320]   And it looks like you're going through Hoth.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.320]   It's wild.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.840]   Beautiful.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.600]   Anyway, loved it.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.640]   I have lots of pictures.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.800]   We'll show them enough.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.960]   Meanwhile, Wil Wheaton's pissed.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.640]   And Lamar, you wanted to talk about this.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.880]   But Lamar, I've got to point out--
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.680]   I've been complaining about this--
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.960]   the Google plusification of everything Google does.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.240]   For some time, it's just gotten worse and worse.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.760]   And now, Wil's complaining that in order to plus one
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.520]   to like a video on YouTube, you have to have a Google Plus
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.400]   account sign in.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.720]   Are you surprised?
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.440]   I'm not surprised at all by this.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.960]   I read his rant, which is a short one.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.920]   And I was like, I don't like Wil,
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.320]   but it's the same little ridiculous
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.680]   that he went off and ranted about this.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.120]   Because YouTube is like the last thing
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.560]   that Google owns that isn't Google-fied.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.600]   It's been sitting on its own island for a while.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.600]   So it makes sense that it starts getting integrated
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.800]   with their products.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.120]   And you think about YouTube even with their messaging
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.160]   system, all of it is still kind of crappy code that they bought.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.920]   And they've never really made a brand new YouTube.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.800]   They're now starting to kind of integrate those things
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.720]   together.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.880]   I think it's a positive thing, Leo.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.360]   He says, for a producer like me, I'm
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.280]   going to lose a crap ton--
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.560]   that's a wheat-nism-- of potential upvotes for Tabletop.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.160]   That's his show about Tabletop gaming
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.080]   on the Felicia Day's new channel.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.040]   Because the core of my audience is tech savvy
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.040]   and may not want to quote upgrade to yet another epic social--
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   It's just not on snot.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.120]   That's a snot sandwich.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.160]   Well, but I agree with him.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.880]   But here's my problem with this.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.760]   Well, I mean, look, I understand this is inevitable.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.320]   We're too cool for school.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.880]   I just don't like it that Google is forcing Google+ down
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.560]   everybody's throat.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.760]   That kind of bugs me.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.280]   But--
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.320]   OK, Jeff, why are we--
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.280]   I felt the same way about Yahoo forcing its registration
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.360]   on us when it got flicker.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.320]   I agree with that.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.120]   However, the problem I have with--
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.720]   is the same with the privacy settings and other things.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.240]   If all of this had started as Google and day one,
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.880]   it would all be Google+ now.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.280]   And no one would complain.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.640]   It's only because they're moving on.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.680]   The legacy thing is that people say, oh, I don't like change.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.720]   I hate change, which is an awful thing for people to say.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.080]   But what about this channel conflict
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.080]   that we've talked about before?
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.720]   Shouldn't Google either be a search engine or a video site?
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.120]   Because it's a search engine.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.600]   It's not a search engine.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.280]   Right.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.640]   So can they get out of the search business now?
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.640]   Well, YouTube is the second biggest search engine
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.640]   that is out there.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.760]   It's the biggest one.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.960]   There's nothing bigger than Google.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.680]   Oh, you're saying YouTube?
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.240]   YouTube, YouTube itself.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:26.600]   So you know--
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.000]   By itself, well, that's interesting.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.840]   You mean by itself, the number two search is on YouTube.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.240]   Absolutely.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.480]   People go there specifically to search for videos.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.920]   That makes sense.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.640]   At some point, Leo, I think they need
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.520]   to combine YouTube and Google+ accounts.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.920]   So if you already have a YouTube account,
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.360]   then what they should do--
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.480]   Oh, they've done that, no, they've done that, Lamar.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.720]   If you have been encouraged for some time now
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.400]   to merge your Google account and your YouTube account.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.160]   Right, right.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.760]   However, you still-- and that's true,
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.160]   but you still need to do the extra step of signing up
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.480]   for Google+, and so they need to simplify that and say,
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.760]   if you already have a YouTube account
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.720]   and you're already signing in, you automatically
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.480]   have Google+, just kind of like they do if you sign up for it.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.160]   That's a Gmail now.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.600]   That's going to happen anyway.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.280]   Although that's what I mean by forcing Google+ down your throat.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.040]   I guess we just have to live with Google+.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.880]   That's-- you're a member.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.840]   I think Willa's upset about the thumbs up,
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.480]   thumbs down being replaced by plus one.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.560]   And really, isn't everyone doing the plus one or likes?
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.920]   Facebook is doing-- there is no negative button.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.640]   If people don't like it, they move on.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.280]   I think it helps with search results
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.760]   because it'll go through our Google,
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.280]   whereas the thumbs up and thumbs down on YouTube right now
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.400]   only stay on YouTube.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.280]   It doesn't provide any metadata for Google
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.280]   and ranking that video.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.440]   I'm all for the thumbs up, thumbs down being gone
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.640]   if it helps our videos be started.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.480]   It's still there on my page.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.240]   I'm here, I am--
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.160]   They're testing it with a few users.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.640]   I've seen some of my subscribers say they have it.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.640]   So we still have thumbs up, thumbs down,
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.120]   but at some point that's going to be replaced by plus one.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.640]   They've been testing it, and it's going to happen.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.520]   It has to happen.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.840]   Because they want to make this all unified.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.640]   Regina, your vote?
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.960]   I thought that Will's rant was a little heavy-handed,
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.040]   but I also am not as active in the YouTube community
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.920]   as he is and as viewers are.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.400]   I mean, I think that there's a whole separate culture
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.720]   inside YouTube, a separate community culture.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.160]   And it's all about views and likes.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.320]   So when you mess with one of those mechanisms,
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.840]   I can see why people would be upset.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.160]   I felt similarly when Yahoo kind of inserted itself
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.760]   into my Flickr experience, for example.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.440]   So I understand being upset when things change.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.280]   At the same time, it seems like this unification
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.720]   is actually a good thing because plus ones on videos
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.680]   will make them rank higher and just plain vanilla Google
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.480]   search results.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.280]   It'll mean that videos show up in the Google+ stream
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.840]   more often.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.240]   You can see videos that your friends
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.520]   liked inside your search results and inside Google+.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.440]   I mean, I think in the end, it's actually good for videos.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.160]   I mean, Will's concern is that it's
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.120]   going to mean that his videos have get fewer likes or plus ones
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.560]   and get less audience.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.280]   But I think that actually the opposite in the long term
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.360]   will happen.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.200]   See, my concern is a little different.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.320]   Let's say as a producer of video,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.160]   I don't want to use YouTube because I keep getting pulled down
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.360]   for all sorts of stupid reasons by companies that
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.080]   have nothing to do with the content of my shows,
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.760]   but somehow have gotten into the Google+.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.000]   Do you think that would happen?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.160]   Happens all the time.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.640]   I know.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.720]   Just theoretically.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.160]   Just theoretically.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.080]   Let's say they were having.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.160]   So I say, well, really, I'm just going to use Vimeo
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.120]   because I really like Vimeo.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.600]   It's giving me a great experience.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.160]   I want my viewers to watch my shows on Vimeo.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.880]   Vimeo does not show up very well on Google
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.240]   because of Google+ and YouTube and the integration.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.440]   Also because it simply just has a lot less traffic.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.520]   Well, but I'm just saying--
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.800]   Is it so high on the universe?
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.000]   I can't make that choice because I
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.800]   need to be on YouTube because regardless of all the other things,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.040]   because that's what shows up best in search.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.000]   It's the new cable MS audio.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.480]   And so that's the channel conflict I'm talking about.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.080]   It forces independent producers to participate in YouTube,
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.720]   even though YouTube is not, by any means, the best solution.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.680]   Quality, the content, pull downs, and the community,
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.080]   the comment community, all are negatives.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.280]   And I'm still required to because of the fact
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.600]   that Google is using its search as leverage.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.480]   That's my issue.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.200]   I've said it before.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.560]   I'm not going to--
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.040]   That's a valid point.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.200]   Hell yeah, it's a valid point.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.800]   I made it.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.800]   It's his show.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   My freaking show.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.040]   It's his show.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.440]   That's all I'm concerned about.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.400]   I'm concerned that's that's that channel conflict.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.480]   So I don't agree so much with what Will's saying in the sense
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.760]   that it's the Google+ification of everything.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.480]   But you're right.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.080]   It says Google.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:55.760]   You're on Google.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.920]   So Google+, if they made-- and they already said
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.080]   that we're going to do this, they're Google+s everywhere.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.560]   It's everywhere.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.200]   Done.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.560]   But I just worry that because Google is also
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.680]   in the content business, as well as the search business,
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.080]   that that's church and state.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.000]   And I'm a little nervous about that.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.560]   I don't know if it's what they've been keeping YouTube
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.560]   separate for so long because of that reason.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.120]   But it's kind of inevitable now.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.160]   So yeah.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.040]   Page has made it really clear that this unification
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.040]   is going to happen.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.520]   So these buttons are an experiment.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.800]   I'm not seeing them yet.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.760]   But it would really surprise me if they didn't go ahead with this.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.560]   Hey, they've got YouTube in the black Google bar.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.640]   I mean, it's all going to be all mushed together eventually,
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.320]   anyway.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.200]   I mean, there's so many ways to like and dislike and flag.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.480]   And I mean, Google Reader is another-- you can share.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.400]   You can star.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.880]   There's all different ways to indicate
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.040]   that you like something.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.160]   I mean, in the long term, I like that there's
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.360]   one universal way to say, I like this.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.240]   And if it helps my search results, that's good, which it will.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.240]   Right.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.560]   But see, that's my issue is that's leveraging Google--
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.880]   is leveraging YouTube up.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.680]   And we think it's somebody at YouTube who likes you, Leo,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.160]   to take care of you.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.720]   That's part of the problem is that I'm not
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.400]   well taken care of by YouTube.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.800]   I mean, that's not right.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.120]   We're not on YouTube live.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.920]   We're not-- you know, there's all these things that we don't get.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.680]   And this is not helping, by the way.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.000]   You can't tell me that they don't-- they're not
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.800]   aware of my increasing negativity towards it.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.080]   And as a result, I'm going to be even further deprecated.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.880]   The smart thing to do would be to embrace you.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.120]   Well, the smart thing for me to do
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.720]   would be to kiss their ass, but I ain't going to do it.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.760]   So Vic Condotra is all excited because Timo Riley is now
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.040]   Mr. Google+, instead of Mr. Twitter, which he's
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.320]   been for a long time.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.360]   Scobble's response is, for the last month,
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.200]   I've been ignoring Google+, and Twitter's
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.000]   spending a lot of time on Facebook.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.240]   That's just so scobble.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.920]   That's so scobble.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.760]   That means the name of a sitcom.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.400]   That's so scobble.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.400]   I was wondering where Robert was.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.920]   He hasn't been around on Google+ now.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.360]   He was Google+ King.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.360]   Yeah, I'm kind of with him that if all you're looking for
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.360]   is the most response--
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:05.860]   Facebook.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.040]   Facebook.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.880]   It may not be the highest quality response,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.560]   because it's everybody, but it's the most response.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.040]   And I put a ton of stuff on Facebook all the time,
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.920]   mostly because all my tools do it.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.760]   Now, it's not that I like Facebook.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.760]   Facebook's a silo.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.040]   It's a walled garden.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.760]   It's the worst of the internet.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.560]   What I want and what we all want, I think,
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.360]   is that we want a free and open internet where all web
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.120]   pages are created equal.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.400]   That's kind of what I would like an independent search
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   engine that isn't in the content business that
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.120]   is ecumenical and searches everything.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.480]   But obviously, that's not going to happen.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.800]   One of the things that was interesting
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.760]   that we talked about at this Nordic Lite Festival--
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.920]   we did talk about the internet.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:52.160]   One of the people there is a really interesting fella who's
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.080]   at Nokia.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.920]   He's a startup guy.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.160]   And Hans-Peter Bronzmull.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.240]   And everybody was a little concerned about the notion
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.000]   that the internet is about to become
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.480]   corporatized to be changed, to not be free and open anymore.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.840]   Do you guys think that that's an issue,
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.680]   that that might be happening, that we may be moving towards
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.840]   silos like Facebook, Twitter, and ultimately Google?
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.440]   It did not already start with AOL with their walled garden
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   back in '90s.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.400]   Well, that was my point.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.640]   AOL did it and failed.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.360]   Right.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.800]   But maybe it's time to come back to it.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.640]   Certainly, that's what Tim Wu says in the Master Switch.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.160]   He says, "It's just a matter of time
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.040]   before big corporate interests assert
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.800]   their control and dominance on the internet."
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.840]   And that's it for the free and open internet.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.520]   That's why I think it's really important to create
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.640]   peer-to-peer networks.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.120]   I definitely think this is a problem.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.800]   And this is a problem that I'm working on,
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.200]   and I hope to make some sort of dent in.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.880]   I definitely think it's an issue.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.720]   And you know, "Scobles" piece about Facebook,
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.960]   and even "Tim's" piece about Google+, Google+ is great,
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.280]   and Facebook has its uses and all that.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.320]   But the reality is, though, if you've got something important
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.680]   to say, if you're a content producer
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.200]   and you want to put it somewhere,
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.640]   that you want to keep, books on a shelf in a library
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.320]   versus just pieces of garbage going down the stream,
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.360]   you've got to blog it and then link it
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.320]   in all your different social streams.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.840]   That's why I spend hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.360]   to have twit.tv.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.720]   Lamar, do you post your content anywhere besides YouTube?
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.160]   Do you have your own Lamar page?
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.960]   - You know, we talk about this in the last tweet,
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.320]   and I have yet to do it because I feel like--
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.560]   - Oh, YouTube is free.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.360]   It's very seductive.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.240]   - Yeah, and I feel like even just have my own website,
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.320]   whether it's, and I do own WilsonTechOne.com
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.000]   where Lamar Wilson got on.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.160]   - But you don't put stuff there?
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.440]   - I don't because I've done sites before,
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.320]   and they sit on an island by themselves
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.560]   and have no social connection, and people don't go,
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.040]   whereas when I make Google+ my primary place or YouTube,
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.960]   then I get all the traffic that I could want.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960]   - Listen to that.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.080]   - It's a tough situation.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.960]   I haven't figured out whether I should blog or not
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.240]   'cause I already do video blogs.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.280]   - So one-hand Leo, you're talking about Facebook
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.720]   being an island and isolated.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.920]   Lamar just said that his site on the open web is an island
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.840]   because it doesn't have all those connections
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.520]   that the social site brings.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.680]   - Well, it's possible to do that with discuss
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.720]   or other tools that can bring social into your--
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.160]   - That's the link, really.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.440]   - Yeah, but I mean, but Lamar is an example
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.160]   of the modern content creator.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.080]   There's so, it's so seductive, YouTube is free.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.640]   Everybody sees it, Google promotes it in search.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.920]   So why not just use YouTube, but I agree with Gina,
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.040]   we wanna have our own place that's ours.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.880]   - Well, I mean--
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.560]   - Who's gonna store all of my videos for free?
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.400]   - Well, this is the thing.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.240]   I mean, I think it's a different,
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.680]   kind of a little bit of a different animal, right?
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.880]   It doesn't make sense for Lamar to stream video
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.920]   from his own web store, it's gonna be costly.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.760]   - We do.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.600]   - You're having us on blog.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.240]   Well, right, you do, but Lamar's a one-man show.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.240]   (laughs)
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.240]   Right, right.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.000]   I think more in terms of like photos and essays,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.440]   if I'm gonna write an essay about something
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.720]   that I feel strongly about, that's,
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.400]   I spend a lot of time working on, I've researched,
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.800]   putting that on Facebook or Google+,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.960]   just feels like it's not giving it
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.400]   sort of the place on my kind of my shelf,
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.200]   the permanent place on the shelf that I want it to have.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.000]   I wanted to have a promo link that I've picked,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.640]   that I've chosen, that I can maintain that I own,
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.920]   regardless of where these networks go in the future.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.440]   And then I'll share a link to it on those places
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.760]   and with excerpts and whatnot, that works.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.880]   So I feel that way about written works and photos
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.040]   to some point, video is kind of a different thing.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.880]   I mean, it wasn't--
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.840]   - Well, because it's so big and rich, right?
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.320]   Because though it's so expensive to store and deliver it.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.160]   - Right, it's costly.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.440]   - You have, Lamar, you have your videos on DVD
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.240]   or the original files kind of stored on your hard drive, right?
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.120]   I mean, you just don't post them to YouTube
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.920]   and let them just, that's it, right?
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.760]   I mean, that would be insane.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.520]   - No, I do keep it back up, I do it back up.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.600]   Actually, two double backups of them.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.440]   - Well, let me, I don't--
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.280]   - Because anything ever happens,
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.480]   I can always put it somewhere else.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.320]   - I wanna take a break,
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.120]   'cause you said something, Gina, that's very provocative.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.560]   There's Wilson Tech one for those of you watching video.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.680]   - He is very handsome.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.680]   - Good looking fella.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.760]   - He is a good looking fella.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.280]   - I don't know who that guy on the top though is,
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.480]   that's a different person.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.440]   (laughing)
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.760]   That's what, that's called insane Wilson.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.520]   (laughing)
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.800]   - I wanna, you said something, Gina, very provocative.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   You basically are advocating a dark net.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.080]   You talked about peer to peer, a secondary internet.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.960]   Let's talk about that when we come back.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.080]   'Cause I think that's exactly what's gonna happen
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.040]   and I'm a little concerned about that too.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.280]   But we're gonna talk about that when we come back.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.360]   You're watching this week in Google,
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.480]   Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, Lamar Wilson, great panel.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.680]   I'm so glad to be back.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.880]   I missed you guys.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.480]   I missed the deep intellectual whining
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.280]   that we've become so well known for.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.160]   And more whining to come,
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.240]   but first a word about stamp.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.360]   Did you know that stamp stock,
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.680]   did you know that two billion letters and packages
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.640]   have been sent using stamps.com?
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.040]   That's how we send all of our mail
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.160]   because you don't have to go to the post office.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.520]   That is just fantastic.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.480]   We've got the USB scale, plug that into the computer,
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.040]   Mac or PC, plop your letter or your package down on it.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.480]   Boom, you know exactly what it costs
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.120]   with always up to date pricing,
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.000]   even though the postage went up.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.720]   Don't worry, stamps.com handles that.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.960]   You never pay more to have you ever put more stamps
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.120]   on a package 'cause you wanna make sure it went through.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.360]   You're wasting money in effect.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.160]   Never again, stamps.com.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.600]   Exactly the right postage all the time.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.560]   Discounts, you can't get at the post office
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.160]   on priority mail and express mail.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.880]   Up to 21% discounts on an express mail.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.800]   15% on priority mail, thanks to stamps.com.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.640]   And you never have to get up from your desk,
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.240]   which for many of us is something, a goal.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.760]   You never have to leave your desk
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.560]   because the postal carrier comes to you,
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.400]   picks up the stuff.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.840]   You can even schedule free pickups anytime.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.680]   I just love it.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.240]   For international mailing, it's great.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.360]   They fill out the forms for you.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.920]   Priority mail, express mail, same thing.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.480]   They pull your addresses for invoices, sales orders
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.000]   or any transaction right from QuickBooks.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.240]   If you use QuickBooks, if you're an eBay or an Amazon seller,
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.360]   it is great.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.000]   You get the data automatically back from eBay.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.320]   You don't have to copy and paste.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.240]   It does it automatically.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.640]   I mean, I can go on and on.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.680]   What I want you to do is visit the site stamps.com.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.760]   Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.640]   I see a special offer $80 value.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.400]   That seems pretty provocative.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.520]   But if you, I would suggest click
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.000]   that little radio microphone in the upper right-hand corner.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.280]   And I want you to use the offer code TWIG
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.400]   and watch what happens.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.600]   Magically, impress go, that $80 offer
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.280]   turns into a $110 bonus offer
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.440]   and you get a creepy picture of me.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.760]   So I don't know which is more appealing.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.960]   I'm gonna sign up just for that picture.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.360]   It's really old.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.400]   That's from the screen savers.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.160]   Leo's going, why don't you use stamps.com?
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.320]   $110 value, $55 in postage coupons,
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.000]   a free digital scale, a $5 supply kit and a four-week trial.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.320]   All for shipping and handling on the scale, that's it.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.640]   You're gonna just love this.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.680]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.200]   Stamps.com, use the offer code TWIG.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.480]   Don't forget to click that microphone
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.840]   to increase the free postage to $55,
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.040]   making it a $110 value in all.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.840]   Stamps.com, it's well named.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.360]   Because that's it.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.200]   That's where you go.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.240]   Not just stamps, postage, everything.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.760]   So Gina, you say you want to start a peer-to-peer internet.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.760]   Is that not a dark net?
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.840]   Is that not a second, like a tiered internet?
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.560]   Like for this, what are you talking about here?
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.200]   So I think that a few years ago, the idea that every single one of us would have a little
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.520]   computer in our pocket where we could install apps, that it's almost as powerful as the
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.520]   computer on our desk.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.520]   That'll never happen.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   It seems insane.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.520]   It seems insane.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.360]   So I think we're moving toward a place where everyone is going to have their own little
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.360]   cloud space, their own little kind of web server.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.760]   We're seeing things like Google Drive and Dropbox and those kind of cloud hosting things,
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.520]   even Carbonite and Mosi get toward it.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.760]   And then we see things like Amazon EC2.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.040]   So the Dropbox Google Drive is for consumers, right?
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:01.240]   But then we see services like Amazon EC2 and AppFog, these kind of virtual machines that
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.560]   you can just spin up and run a web application on.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.000]   Those are mostly for developers.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.160]   I think that those two classes of product are going to merge and it's going to be really
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:18.040]   easy for people to spin up apps or kind of their own websites on hosting providers.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.080]   But it's going to be very easy.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.400]   As easy as it is to install an app on your phone right now.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.200]   And then everyone's going to have their own kind of little personal cloud.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.840]   And they can serve content where they can stream that content out to different silos
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.000]   like Facebook and Twitter and Google+ and wherever else.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.080]   And little clouds that can talk to one another as well.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.080]   So we own and control our data in a space that we pay for, that we can choose a provider
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.080]   for.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:51.440]   But we're also not just pumping data into corporate owned social networks like Facebook
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.520]   and even Google+ who own our content and make decisions about what our profile picture can
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.120]   look like and what our URLs look like and all that stuff.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.120]   So that's the kind of thing that I want to see happen and that's part of what I'm trying
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.720]   to work on the think up.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.560]   I think that's admirable.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.400]   But don't you worry that if you think-
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.120]   Go ahead.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:17.280]   So just to- usually I have to understand, if you were running an app, let's say a video
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.360]   editing app, is that something that you think you run on your server in the cloud or that
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.200]   you use somebody else's but your data is constantly going back to your spaces so you can use apps
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.520]   here and there.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.720]   But or is that an app that you run locally again?
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.600]   I mean, I like the idea of being able to run apps from everywhere.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.840]   But I like the idea of kind of hosting, controlling my own data.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.640]   So it's the data you want to control?
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.920]   It's the data that I want to control.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   So yeah.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.160]   So having that data store, having being able to export it, get to it in different ways,
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.320]   slice and dice it in different ways and the ability for different cloud apps to work on
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:56.440]   it and for me to apply filters to it or this is this gets into kind of what think up wants
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.160]   to do at some point.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.160]   So the apps, it doesn't matter where the apps are hosted but it's the owning your data
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.920]   and being able to stream it out to other places in a way.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:13.320]   What's closest to doing that now?
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.640]   There's nothing quite consumer ready yet.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.120]   We think of working with PHP fog who I really like that they're getting really close to
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.840]   making it easy to kind of have this one click install of an app like WordPress or ThinkUp
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.840]   or Drupal.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.200]   We've had these one click installers on hosting providers.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.520]   We've had these for years.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.640]   But I want to get to a place where it's like it's so easy, it's just like I said, as easy
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.720]   as installing an app kind of on your phone or in your browser.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.920]   I mean, I can see the, I'm sorry.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.480]   We still a lot of work to do.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.480]   Go ahead Lamar.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.720]   No, I'll say I could see the geeks definitely being into this.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:56.280]   I know you're saying this is going to be easy but the idea of even hosting your own stuff,
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:01.120]   I mean even the idea of Google Drive and Dropbox scares the pants off most average consumers.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.880]   They don't want to deal with that.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:08.960]   They just like it where some of them use their own ISP email versus getting a Gmail.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.920]   It's going to take a, what do you think it'll take to get people to realizing, hey, this
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.360]   is a one button press and you have your own servers and it's not complicated like it could
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.360]   be now.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:26.840]   I think as Gina said, apps on the phone, you might have said before, oh, nobody's going
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.440]   to carry something with all those apps on it.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.280]   I think that's penetrated consumer consciousness.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.800]   And I mean, it has to be an absolutely compelling experience.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:36.800]   Right?
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.120]   I mean, that's what gets people to try.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.240]   I think it's the other way around.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.480]   I think it will be transparent.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.000]   I don't think it'll be an experience at all.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.440]   I think it's just going to happen and people won't know they're doing it almost.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.400]   Intel inside cloud inside.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.920]   I mean, that's why Apple has, Apple is doing I dry a cloud.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.920]   You know, what is it?
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.920]   I cloud.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.960]   That's why Sky, dry sky box, sky fire.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.400]   I don't freaking know the name.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.800]   Sky drive on windows.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.520]   That's why the OS companies are doing it because they want it to be internal, transparent.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.200]   And I think you're, I think you're exactly right.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:15.360]   I think the idea of apps software as a service will become as commonplace as apps are today.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.640]   And it will be, I don't think you'll know you're doing it.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.640]   Right.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.960]   I mean, like Mark's or he's watching.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.380]   Here's the magic I anticipate three or four years from now, maybe even sooner.
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:32.100]   This is a thin client, your computer, whatever you're using, and you log into a state that
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.360]   is out there, everything is out there.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.900]   There's nothing on here.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:42.500]   And all your apps and everything are out there running off servers.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.020]   The advantage of that is you don't care what device you're using.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.100]   It's a similar experience across all platforms.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.500]   Is that what you're talking about, Gina?
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.500]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.980]   I mean, that's part of what I'm talking about.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.980]   That's correct.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.740]   Like my app is a, is a, is a to do app, right?
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.980]   It writes to Dropbox.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.280]   It writes to do lists just everywhere because it just sinks magically.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:01.020]   The problem with the Chromebook or Chrome OS is it looks like a browser.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.460]   It can't do that.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.820]   You know, they made a mistake by making it look too much like a browser.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:07.820]   Why is it?
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:08.820]   Who's running, who's running the servers?
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.060]   It should be an app that's, that's why I'm starting to understand who's running the
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.060]   servers.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.220]   Is it going to be a big company like Google?
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.420]   Somebody evil like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.420]   What is it?
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.420]   It's still an actual server.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.420]   And I'm trying to host.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.420]   So you can.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.420]   Right.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.420]   You get a choice.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.420]   Or you could, or you could.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.420]   Truthfully, if you, but this is be your, this is where Lamar, you're right.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.620]   This is way too sophisticated.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.020]   There's no reason you couldn't have a Pogo plug or similar device and be doing exactly
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.340]   the same thing out of your house.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.340]   And then you're not using Google and Gina will be the person who's just like now saying,
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.340]   you ought to have your own webpage.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.780]   We'll be saying you ought to have your own cloud.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.580]   And, but you'll be in the minority as I will be.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:52.180]   I wrote this and what would Google do where, you know, I, I think that this is, this is
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.780]   this is really dreamy.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.380]   This is really going beyond the pale of optimism.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.500]   But your cable company, your ISP should have been thinking this way for years.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.500]   Here's your space.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.500]   Yes.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.940]   Remember you used to get a website when you got a internet access, which was hilarious.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:08.940]   Yeah.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.940]   It's crazy.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.740]   But they should go back to that.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.820]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.180]   I think they should go back to that.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:19.660]   Now, of course Comcast has caps, which is going to make all of the, you know, so this
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.140]   is part of the issue is net neutrality has to be preserved.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.220]   And, and caps have to be overturned.
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.580]   But, and that means there has to be competition caps do not survive in the face of true competition.
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.820]   The only reason they can exist at all is because who are you going to go to?
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.820]   Right.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:35.820]   So we go the opposite way.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:40.340]   There's a story on the rundown talking about the rival, the Schmitternet.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.620]   Point on this very show.
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.820]   Schmitt happens.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.820]   What is the Schmitternet?
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.660]   Well, it argues that, that now that you have Comcast, I think we've talked about this
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:57.900]   but glancingly, if you have Comcast going through a gain console and saying, oh, that
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.740]   doesn't count toward your cap, Bingo.
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.540]   That's the end of wired net neutrality right there.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.340]   Because it says that that traffic that goes through that device where they have a special
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.340]   deal.
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.340]   Absolutely.
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.340]   Yep.
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.140]   So customer.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.540]   Right.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:19.540]   So, Gina, I'm trying to, you know, the two ways to think about your vision is one to look
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.340]   for the opportunity and who should do it and who could do it, worth the business.
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:28.100]   The other is to look at the danger and say, how will the big boys stop this?
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:32.860]   Well, and you know one way they're going to stop at Apple is already rejecting any app
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.700]   that has Dropbox in it.
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:35.700]   Bingo.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.420]   Don't even get me started.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.180]   Or these big companies will buy the ISPs and then they have the control.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:46.540]   So this goes back to a discussion of principles that we have to have.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:51.460]   This is a discussion that you missed last week, Leo, having a much better time eating
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.460]   dried fish.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:58.340]   But I talked about this event that you square ventures held on hacking society and, you
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.700]   know, a discussion of principles around this.
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:07.100]   I keep on saying this vital so that you can look at any of these players and say, no,
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.500]   no, no, that defines evil.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.780]   Tim Woop totally predicted this in the master switch.
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:15.620]   He said, look, they're not going to sit back on their haunches for much longer and allow
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.380]   a free and open internet.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:22.740]   As soon as you guys work out all the technical details, AT&T Comcast for rising, whoever the
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.940]   stakeholders are, just say, hey, thanks, see ya.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:26.940]   We got it.
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.260]   We'll take it from here.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.660]   That's why Gina, everybody has to learn how to program.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.500]   No, everybody doesn't have to.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.500]   Yes.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.700]   Right now I pay for a backup service like, like Carbonite.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:43.260]   I pay for web hosting and I pay for, well, I don't pay for it, but I might upgrade my
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.900]   Google Drive or my Dropbox for more storage.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.620]   So I'm already paying for kind of web space, cloud space.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:54.100]   I want all those things to just kind of merge and I want companies to compete to provide
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.100]   that to me.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.700]   I mean, Amazon is absolutely equipped to provide that.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.580]   Right now you can spin up a virtual machine on Amazon and run what you want, store what
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.060]   you want.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.820]   Google is absolutely in addition to do this.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.260]   Companies like Carbonite, MOSI, companies like Dropbox.
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:12.420]   I mean, everybody's sort of coming at this from a different angle, but the reality is
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:17.260]   is that we're moving toward a place where everyone has kind of their own personal cloud.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.580]   And I just want to see those things merge.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.020]   I want to see it become really easy.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:24.420]   I want to see it get to a place where it's really easy for anyone to spin up a web app
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.700]   anywhere and make it as easy as it is to install an app on your phone.
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.220]   I think that this can happen.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.220]   I don't know.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.100]   Most people think I'm crazy when I talk about this because they're like, that's just never
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.100]   going to happen.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.340]   No one wants to host their own website.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.660]   It's too much of a pain.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.500]   Everyone wants hosted service where they don't have to think about it.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:46.540]   That might be true, but I think there are a lot of interesting advantages that you get
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.540]   when you own your own cloud.
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.260]   You can do your own calculations on your own data when you own your own data and when you
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.940]   can do peer-to-peer communications.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:58.380]   I think there's a lot of business opportunity here for even for these companies.
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.380]   So that's what you should be building.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.780]   That's the key to that.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:02.780]   The key to that, you are building.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.780]   I know.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:09.500]   But the key to that becomes the first consumer prospect you can give of adding value through
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.500]   being together.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:16.260]   Only because this data and that data are in the same place and you control it, can you
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.940]   get X and Y are in the same place, can you get Z?
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.540]   So you become the provider of Z.
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.340]   Right, exactly.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:29.380]   So instead of going to a party that Facebook is hosting, having a party in a public space
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:35.340]   but getting value from that space, meaning if my cloud can talk to your cloud, Jeff,
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:40.820]   what can we get from that that we can't necessarily get from, you know, a party?
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.700]   It doesn't obviate Facebook existing.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:46.660]   It just demands the Facebook be portable.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:53.340]   Right, I mean, Facebook can still exist and we can be pumping content into Facebook.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.420]   Facebook actually does benefit from this.
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.900]   Facebook can get more interesting data from us because we've got computing power on our
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:03.220]   side and we can get insights and analytics from our own stuff and our own social graph
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.460]   that maybe, you know, Facebook doesn't surface.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.360]   The problem is that Facebook then no longer has a monopoly on that information and that
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.620]   means a competitor can come along and that's not what Facebook's going to want to have
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.620]   happen.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.620]   Right?
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.300]   They want to protect their monopoly on that information.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.420]   That's why Facebook right now is a silo.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.780]   Facebook has no read API, right?
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:27.740]   No, and the funny thing is you have the bottom.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.900]   They have a graph, social graph, but what was the deal?
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.180]   Well, I guess they changed this, but for a while it was only 24 hours.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.180]   They changed that though.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:39.980]   Oh, they have all kinds of crazy terms of service about how you can access the API.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.340]   They really want to control that.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.700]   They do not.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.260]   They absolutely do all the more reason why you should want to host your data in your
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.460]   own space where you can decide what people can do with it.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.460]   Right.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.460]   Okay.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.460]   Okay.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.460]   I'll get a website.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.460]   Nobody knows.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.460]   The Mars case is actually really a good one.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.900]   Hosting your own video files does not make sense for an indie creator.
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.340]   It just absolutely doesn't.
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.820]   But Lamar, you shouldn't have back up all your videos.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.820]   The website, yeah.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.740]   Streaming video, I mean hosting video is just huge files.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.740]   It's very costly.
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:13.020]   But as server space and bandwidth and CPU cycles and virtual machines and all the cost
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:19.500]   of those things go down, that would come I think maybe easier in the future.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.300]   But you do have a backup of everything because if YouTube goes away or if there's a new video
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.300]   distribution channel, you want to be able to get your stuff there too.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.300]   Absolutely.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.300]   Right.
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:32.340]   But the other thing you have to say that YouTube did write in its original model is by making
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.380]   the content that you do put there embeddable.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.620]   It allows you to put it on your blog.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:41.780]   It allows you to put it on Google+ which of course they do.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:48.020]   How easy is it to put it from YouTube, on Facebook or YouTube?
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.940]   It's a button click away.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:50.940]   It's right.
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.940]   They really made it super easy.
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.980]   So what they're doing is they're hiding the fact that they have the content you don't.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.580]   It looks like you have the content.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:01.420]   Well, that's the cynical conspiratorial way to look at it.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.420]   Yes.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:07.540]   But I would also say that it also lets you put the content wherever you want.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.500]   The problem is the opposite.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.740]   Until they pull it down because of content violations.
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:13.740]   I agree.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.740]   Stipulated, your honor.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:15.740]   Yes.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.780]   But I would also say that Google+ should allow you to easily embed Vimeo videos and you
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.780]   can't do that.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.940]   Do you know how crude we would be if our only source of video were to be?
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:26.940]   Or YouTube?
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.740]   Well, Google+ allows you to-- Google+ embeds Vimeo.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:31.740]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.620]   If you put a video link in Google+, it will embed it.
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:35.620]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.620]   Really?
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:41.180]   Oh, I've got-- because when you go in and embed a video, it asks you for a YouTube URL.
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:45.020]   I think if you just drop a link in the compose box, it should.
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.820]   It should, assuming videos do-- they'd have to actively block Vimeo because there's a
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:52.860]   standard right for what will happen when you put a link in.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.420]   And if you have the right metadata in there, it's supposed to just do it.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.980]   So they would have to do something highly anti-competitive that would get them in a
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:37:59.980]   lot of trouble.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.700]   Vimeo would have cried foul long ago if that happened.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.700]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.700]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.700]   I'm trying it right now, but I'm pretty sure that--
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.700]   I'm sure it does.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.140]   And that's really up to Vimeo, including the metadata that will tell YouTube how to display
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.140]   it and stuff.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.540]   Now, what I'm curious about is, did they display the video as big?
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:16.540]   They do.
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.060]   The video is big with a big play button.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.060]   It's-- if you just drop a link in it.
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.060]   Never mind.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.060]   Never mind.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.060]   They'd have to do that.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.060]   They'd have to do that.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.060]   They'd have to do that.
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.060]   All right.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.060]   Well, unlike Apple, that just starts blocking apps.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.060]   Dropbox.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:34.060]   Well, that's-- and what is the excuse that there is an in-app purchase involved?
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.060]   Because--
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:39.820]   When you log in to Dropbox from your iOS account, it says it brings you to the Dropbox
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.180]   website and says sign in to Dropbox to grant access.
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.180]   Right.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:47.100]   And there's a link that says, if you don't have a Dropbox account, you can create one
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.100]   here.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.100]   If you click on the Create link, you can register for a Dropbox account.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:56.500]   And then on the confirmation page, Dropbox says, oh, by the way, you can buy more storage
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.500]   if you'd like.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:02.680]   And that is what Apple is objecting to, that three or four clicks into the Interaction
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:08.340]   With Dropbox in Mobile Safari, you can purchase storage from Dropbox.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.740]   It's truly a restraint of trade.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:16.020]   I mean, it really crosses a line from protecting your business interests into being just a
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.940]   big old, unreasonable bully.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.300]   I'm not working with Dropbox right now.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:26.460]   It seemed like a really unreasonable reason to reject Dropbox apps.
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:31.140]   I mean, it's not like Dropbox has a big, you know, buy more space link, you know, on
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.140]   the first screen.
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.580]   It's several screens in and it's not required.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:35.580]   Anyway, sorry.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.940]   Here's the Vimeo embedding.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.340]   Yeah, you just paste in a link and you get a nice--
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.500]   Okay, I was wrong.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.420]   No, but I love that Google does that the right way.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.860]   Yeah, because all you have to have in Vimeo, of course, knows how to do this is the right
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:57.300]   metadata associated with whatever that link points to and Google will display it appropriately
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.300]   with big pictures.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.940]   And so what that means is, so the two-way portability would be this, right?
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:08.100]   Coming in, I should be able to similarly embed an article, a blog post, a slideshow, or whatever
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.100]   I want from anywhere.
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.620]   You can't, as long as they support-- you can, including your own page if you have the right
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.620]   metadata.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.380]   Right, so you need that, right?
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:19.160]   Now, the other problem is that you-- it's fine and wonderful that they have the data
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.580]   liberation front, but it's only batch.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:26.540]   What I should be able to do is take anything I wrote on Google+, and not only embed it elsewhere,
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.820]   but now to Gina's point, allow it to mingle with my own data elsewhere.
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.980]   Right, like, you know, plus ones right now.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.540]   So I plus one stuff all the time.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.540]   Where do they go?
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.540]   What happens to them?
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.900]   Can I see a list of all the things that I plus one?
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:41.900]   Actually, you can't.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.900]   Where does it go?
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.900]   It just goes away into the ether.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.900]   I just press this button.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.900]   What is that?
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:54.860]   Well, Gina, on your Google+ page, you can actually go to your profile, and then at the
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.340]   last link should be plus ones.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.380]   And you can actually see a list of all your plus ones.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.780]   Oh, you see there we go again.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.700]   But it's not everything I've never plus one.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.700]   It's not easy to find.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.700]   It's not easy to find it.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.700]   It's not everything.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:10.140]   Like, if I plus one just a post on Google+, like those aren't listed here.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.580]   These are only things I plus one in the search results or like on page.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.580]   So there's a bunch of plus ones that just sort of get lost in the ether.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:22.940]   So if I do plus one something on YouTube, I don't, you know, where does that go?
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:23.940]   That is not useful to me.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.580]   That is only useful to Google right now, right now.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.060]   But that annoys me.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.060]   Why am I going to the trouble of plus oneing stuff to help Google with the search results
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:35.540]   if I can't, you know, export my plus ones, if I can't publish them to a stream, you know,
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.220]   if I can't do stuff with that, with that data.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.020]   And analyze them and find the trends in them and find what has to be found.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.020]   Exactly.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.220]   See what other things my friends have plus one and cross reference, which one's what,
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.260]   I mean, there's all kinds of cool stuff that you can do with that.
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:50.300]   And I have no doubt that Google is going to release the ability, you know, or, you know,
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:54.020]   it's going to release all kinds of interesting ways to do stuff with your plus one.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:42:00.380]   But right now it's just kind of like I press a button and I do a do it for Google.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.380]   I think you're right.
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:05.340]   I think those kinds of trends, if you're able to see exactly where your traffic is coming
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.340]   from.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:10.620]   It's such value, it encourages you to make better posts or make different kind of posts, knowing
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:12.220]   exactly where that's coming from.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:13.780]   So I 100% agree with you.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.420]   I never look at the plus one list.
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.740]   It's my first time looking at mine in about two months.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.820]   It seems kind of old.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:23.140]   This is stuff I've plus one like the number one plus one is Twitter and then my blog,
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.860]   then your blog, Jeff.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.540]   It seems like it's kind of, I don't understand the order of this even.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:34.580]   These are like just plus things that I plus one on other sites or in search results.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.580]   That's what it looks like.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.300]   Yeah, but it's not like post that I plus one inside.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.820]   And now for I guess what they would say is that these plus ones will show, I think they
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:47.820]   do say will show up when your friends search for something that you've plus one.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.260]   It will say to you, hey, Leo plus one to this.
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.020]   It gives it a higher ranking or gives it right.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.020]   That's where it shows up.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.260]   Oh, but where are all the Google plus posts that I've plus one?
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.540]   Like these are just links.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.540]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.060]   These are not Google plus posts.
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.060]   Those don't show up here.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.060]   Huh?
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.060]   They don't show up here.
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.060]   Where do they go?
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.060]   What happens to them?
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.060]   What am I doing?
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.060]   I don't understand.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.820]   I guess it's the thing.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:15.660]   If you, if you Facebook like someone's post, where does that go?
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.380]   It just kind of disappears into nothingness.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:22.020]   I think that's what's happening with the Google plus post, which is unfortunate.
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:25.900]   Because I like to be able to save some of those to go back to like I told Vic talk to
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:30.540]   him in a private chest like I would love the ability to star post like you do in Google
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.020]   Reader so I can refer back to them.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.620]   And I thought plus one would give me that ability, but it doesn't.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.620]   It doesn't.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.380]   All it does is give the search engine up more.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:40.380]   It's for Google.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.420]   It's to give the search engine another single signal.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.420]   And I think people would be more likely to use it if it had more impact than just helping
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.420]   Google.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:48.420]   Right.
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.420]   Yes.
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:50.420]   Yes.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.180]   Well, hey, now they give us free stuff.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.180]   So.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.180]   Well, right.
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:01.660]   And sometimes the Google giveth and sometimes the Google take us away as in the case of Java,
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:09.180]   we're going to talk about the debate over whether Google screwed son or as James Gosling,
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:16.140]   the creator of Java says slimed son or a we didn't copy anything.
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.820]   The Oracle Google update coming up also.
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:22.220]   Galaxy Nexus information.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.300]   And I'm just going to stick the word.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.580]   John Ham in here.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.780]   I don't know why.
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.660]   John Ham.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.820]   I guess he's there's a Google bogus Google scandal.
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.820]   He sounds delicious.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.820]   I'm hungry.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:35.820]   John.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:36.820]   John Ham's John Ham's delicious.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:37.820]   Let me tell you.
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:44.420]   He's the best looking man on television.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.420]   I assume it's the same John.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.420]   Yes, it is.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:47.420]   Good.
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:48.420]   I'm just checking.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.900]   Good looking guy.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.340]   Boy, you put him next to Rupert Murdoch.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.020]   It really is it really is beauty in the beast, isn't it?
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.540]   It truly is.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.340]   It's kind of like the picture of Dory and Gray.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.500]   This is what he would look like if he didn't have that picture in the attic.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.660]   We're going to talk about that in just a bit, but first a word.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:11.340]   Since we're talking about disintermediation, disruption, subversion, let's talk about
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:16.620]   a company that wants to completely disrupt the mobile phone industry.
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:22.860]   Ting and their dump your contract contest for the month of May.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.260]   Oh, I love this.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:31.740]   Yeah, we'll buy out one winner's mobile service contract every day this month.
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:37.460]   Every day this month, go to ting.com/dyc to dump your contract.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:41.820]   First, you find out how much you would save with Ting.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.180]   And by the way, I have to say I love Ting.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.060]   So what does Ting, oh, I should explain probably.
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.860]   Elliot Noss at Two Cows came to us last fall and said, I want to do this new thing.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.340]   I want you guys to be in on this.
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.980]   He says, we're going to be an MVNO that is a mobile virtual network operator.
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.420]   We're going to take service resell it.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.020]   We're going to create a whole new way of doing cell phone service.
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.580]   No contracts.
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:09.940]   You pay for just what you use no more.
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.140]   And we're going to change the mobile phone industry.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.180]   And I think they are one user at a time.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.540]   Take a look at the plans.
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:21.780]   If you go to ting.com and this is the getting started thing, you purchase your device.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.300]   They have actually a really nice list of devices now.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.340]   Activate your device.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.940]   Then choose your plan.
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.500]   Let's go to choose your plan because this is kind of fun.
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.940]   Now you don't even have to choose a plan.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.900]   I should mention you could just ignore this process and just pay for what you want.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.820]   But if you want to kind of have an idea, you get to buy minutes, text messages and
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:44.860]   data separately, completely not combined.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:47.580]   You can buy 0, 0, 0 across the board and just pay for what you use.
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:51.740]   And there's no premium if you go over, right?
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:56.500]   You pay a certain amount per device, $6 per device per month.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.540]   And nothing more if you and then you pay for what you use.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:02.140]   Or you can take a look if you had $3,000 minutes.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:03.700]   That's $52 a month.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.940]   If you had $6,000 text messages, $14 a month.
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.780]   But the thing is get 0.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:13.900]   Go across the board with 0 and just pay as you go.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.660]   But if you want a plan, you can do more.
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.660]   Go to their calculator, see how much you'd save.
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:18.660]   It's amazing.
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.700]   Let's take a look at the devices because every time I go here, they add their phone.
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:22.700]   They're on devices.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.580]   You can bring your own device.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.340]   But they add some devices right now.
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:29.540]   This is San Joseo for $100.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:33.820]   Up to the Motorola Photon, which is kind of the hot new top of the line phone.
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:34.980]   $580.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.620]   And I want to give you a new URL.
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.620]   This is another one, ting.com/twig.
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:42.140]   You'll save $50 off of that device.
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:45.060]   Now the reason these are a little more expensive, they're not subsidized because there's no
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.700]   early termination fee.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.620]   It's no two year deal.
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:49.620]   This is it.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.620]   And for the month, you are under no obligation.
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.860]   They also have great customer support.
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:56.860]   No wait.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.500]   8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, they will not put you on hold.
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.780]   They have great email support and an active discussion forum.
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.460]   Blog, tweet.
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:09.660]   It's really run by a bunch of geeks who wanted to transform the way cell phone service works
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.660]   and it is fantastic.
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:15.900]   And for the month of May, don't forget to enter the contest.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:22.380]   No purchase necessary, ting.com/dyc to dump your contract.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:29.260]   They'll buy out one person a month for the next month.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.700]   And I think that there's no purchase necessary.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:37.580]   Open all US residents age 18 plus who are on a mobile phone service contract.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:38.660]   They can't do this overseas.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:43.340]   I apologize for our international listeners because it's much more complicated.
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:51.140]   But for those of you in the US suffering under the tyranny of AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprinter Verizon,
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:54.220]   this is an opportunity to dump your contract.
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.060]   Ting.com/dyc.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.460]   Great for businesses too because you know, you just as many handsets as you want, six
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:06.300]   bucks a month, the handset, a big pool of data or minutes that you get really nice as
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.300]   you're using it.
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.300]   I should pull this up.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.300]   I can't though.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.300]   I don't want to show the phone number.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:15.260]   You get usage by device, easy to access, billing information, control over what features.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.660]   So it's good for business, help content.
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.700]   It's great for families, great for businesses, great for individuals.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:25.860]   Ting, ting.com, say 50 bucks on your device at ting.com/twig.
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:33.020]   And don't forget to enter the dump your contract contest at ting.com/dyc.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.340]   They pay the ETF.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.140]   That's a good idea I think.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:44.220]   Once you're out of your mobile contract, stay contractfree with ting.com.
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:50.420]   Google says there was no copying, closing statements for the Google trial.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:56.100]   Google employed Java APIs in a fair use manner for Android, transforming them into a full
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.100]   smartphone stack.
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:05.060]   Meanwhile James Gosling says Google's slimed son.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.660]   Gina, you're the programmer here.
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.100]   What do you think of all this?
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:11.300]   I'm sure you've been following this.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:15.020]   You know, the Gosling, the Gosling post or statements about it.
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:16.740]   I mean, he's the creator.
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:17.740]   So I tend to.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.740]   He wrote it.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:19.740]   Yeah, he wrote it.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:20.740]   So I'm like, OK.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:24.220]   And I doubt he has any loyalty to Oracle at this point.
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.220]   I mean, you know, he wrote it for son.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:30.100]   Most of the son guys left when Oracle took over.
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.660]   He says Oracle's doing the right thing, suing.
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.060]   Well, right.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.660]   But he left Oracle a few months after they acquired son.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:43.100]   Well, he's basically saying that no one here is clearly in the right, that everyone's being
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.980]   sort of slimy.
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:49.180]   But he's saying that it wasn't in son's DNA to sue Google over what they were doing with
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.180]   Java.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.700]   They were not happy about it, but they kind of grit their teeth and put on a happy face
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:59.020]   and said, hey, we're glad to see the Java's being utilized across, you know, in such a
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:02.660]   huge ecosystem that Android is.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.540]   So here's the interesting thing.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:08.380]   He says, while I have differences with Oracle, in this case, they are in the right Google
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.220]   totally slimed son.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.620]   We were all really disturbed.
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:15.820]   Even Jonathan, Jonathan Schwartz, who was the CEO of son until the sale, he just decided
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:20.300]   to put on a happy face and tried to turn lemons into lemonade, which annoyed a lot of folks
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.300]   at son.
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:26.380]   So Gosling saying Schwartz knew that there was violation, you know, copyright violation
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:31.020]   or patent violation and decided, and we're going to live with it.
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.540]   Oracle, they feel the same way.
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:36.340]   They decided that, hey, Google was making this huge thing.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:41.060]   They were putting Java to great use, and he was going to get it into a lot of people's
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.060]   hands.
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:45.100]   They decided to just go along with it and say, hey, yeah, we're a part of this, instead
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.260]   of suing them over it.
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.220]   But Google says it was fair use.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.340]   Although Google tried to win this trial on a technicality, right?
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:56.380]   They pulled the disks that Oracle filed and there was no data on them.
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:59.180]   I mean, this has just been us.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:04.180]   They're blank.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.180]   What happened?
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.180]   It needed a cloud backup.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:07.180]   That's pretty funny.
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.180]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:13.060]   Oh, we forgot to put anything on those disks.
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:14.060]   Just take his written.
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.060]   There's something there.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:19.700]   So the fact that they're trying to win on that technicalities a little bit like, I
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:23.740]   mean, this whole time I've been, I've been kind of like, I've been feeling that, you
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:28.860]   know, that it was fair use and that as a developer, I would assume that those APIs
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:32.060]   that they're arguing about would be just part of it.
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.060]   I would make the same assumptions.
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:36.540]   At the same time, you know, you have an email from Andy Rubin saying, hey, we should get
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.540]   a license for this.
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.540]   And then they didn't.
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:39.540]   And they tried to get the technicality.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:44.020]   But now you have the creator saying, hey, you know what, Google did slime us.
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.540]   We just, it wasn't in some of these DNA to sue them, but Oracle's Oracle's in the right
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.540]   doing it.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:54.580]   He said the Oracle's lawyers eyes sparkled during the acquisition talks.
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.420]   He said that this is an ego money and power play.
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.820]   I mean, which isn't surprising.
[00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:02.380]   But now I was kind of delighted by this whole thing in the beginning.
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.220]   Now I'm just kind of like, okay.
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:09.180]   So, Gina, I wanted to ask you, what do you feel about the, you know, the, what's his
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.180]   name, Nest?
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:14.540]   So basically saying that, well, you know, son approved this publicly.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:20.500]   He said he likes Android and likes what Google is doing knowing full well.
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.700]   Is that a mission on a blog post or somewhere public?
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.700]   Does that make it a legal case?
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:31.540]   I mean, does that make it, does that strengthen Google in that case?
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:32.820]   I mean, in my eyes, it did.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.660]   I'm not a lawyer, but in my eyes that, that son, you know, an Oracle were thrilled with
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:42.060]   the adoption of Java that Android, you know, Android got Java in the hands of millions
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.060]   of people and they did.
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:47.220]   They created a whole new brand new smartphone stack and a complete new ecosystem.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.700]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.700]   I love Android.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:51.740]   I love what Google's done with Android.
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.660]   And so, yeah, in the beginning, I said, well, they were full support of this and now they're
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.660]   suing what's going on.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:58.620]   But you know, there's always a story behind the scenes.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:03.260]   Now hearing Gosling say, hey, you know, we weren't thrilled that they didn't quite comply
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:08.120]   with, you know, that the whole job is the whole base of Java was idea of like, right
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.580]   once run anywhere, right?
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:13.420]   That you write the same code and could run on every single device everywhere.
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:16.940]   And apparently, you know, Android breaks that a little bit.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:21.260]   That bothers me a little bit as a developer, especially as a Java developer.
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:25.180]   You know, I mean, I think you make public statements because you say, hey, you know, this
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:27.540]   thing that we made is part of a huge new thing.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.740]   That's sweeping the tech world.
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:31.660]   But you know, in the background, if they were feeling slighted, if they felt like, hey,
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:37.180]   you didn't, you didn't use this in the spirit with which we put it out into the world, you
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.180]   know, I get that.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.180]   He says Gosling says something fun.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:43.020]   I just want to say this quote because I laugh so hard.
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:44.380]   He kind of slammed Android a little bit.
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:48.620]   He says, basically what's going on in the Android world is that there is no kind of
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:50.340]   adult in charge.
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:54.140]   All these handset manufacturers are doing what they damn well, please, which means it's
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:55.140]   just going to be randomness.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:00.980]   That's called open source, though, James, you support that, I thought.
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:01.980]   Exactly.
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:02.980]   Maybe not.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:05.940]   Yeah, but you know, there's also the, there's standards and there's, you know, you buy a
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:09.740]   license and that, that makes sure that you sort of comply by a certain, you know, to a
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:13.340]   certain number of rules and standards that Java enforces.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:16.700]   I mean, that's a good thing having, having, having at least a standard to work toward
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:20.260]   Google does this too with their, with their hardware specs, you know, the Google name
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.740]   doesn't go on handsets that don't comply with all the Google specs.
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:27.740]   Now, Android does not use the Java brand, you know, it doesn't say Java anywhere.
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.100]   It doesn't copy a couple of go.
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:32.780]   It doesn't, you know, so, so they can argue, Hey, yeah, we changed things a little bit.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:35.300]   We never got the license, but we're not using your branding anywhere.
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:37.060]   We're not saying this is Java.
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:41.980]   Kind of like what Amazon is doing with, with the, with the, with the fire.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:44.940]   I mean, this is how it works.
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.460]   And, and the chat room down climb says, right once, Sue everywhere.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:55.220]   So I just threw this in so we can look at a picture of John Hamm.
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:56:01.460]   He is a beautiful man, especially in this season of bad men.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.620]   I just, I just watched, I just watched the acid trip episode.
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:11.500]   I'm one behind, but my God, my God, he's having a good, Raj is having a good season.
[00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.020]   He's executive, he's an executive producer.
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.900]   I think he's writing himself in stuff now.
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.620]   He's like, I want to pass a trip.
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.860]   Oh, I didn't only get better in this past week.
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:21.860]   Oh, good.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:22.860]   I can't wait.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:23.860]   No spoilers.
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:27.460]   It was such a weird, you felt like you were on acid watching the week before because it
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.460]   was all out of order.
[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.980]   It's like, wait a minute.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:31.660]   Didn't they already go to Howard Johnson?
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.660]   I don't.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.100]   Anyway, I've got to confess.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.100]   You don't watch.
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.100]   You don't.
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.140]   Only a million people watch Mad Men.
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:39.300]   It's a tiny show.
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.180]   I had no idea what you even talking about until you said mad on.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:43.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:45.540]   Just Gina and me.
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.580]   I know this is this is sub glee.
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:49.780]   I can't believe you don't watch Mad Men, Jeff.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:55.580]   It's so you tried the first episode and it seemed so sledgehammer, unsuddled.
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:56.580]   Really?
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:01.700]   Yeah, the racism and the sexism was just just without the slightest subtly.
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:05.380]   And I just throw me nuts and I tried to watch the first couple of the sides multiple times
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.380]   and I just gave up.
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:07.380]   You got to come better.
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:11.220]   I know I'm in the minority, but I couldn't do it.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.060]   And then once that once I was lost, I was lost.
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:18.460]   I'd force yourself to go back and watch all five seasons right now, Jeff.
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.460]   That's it.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.460]   Jeff, you're done.
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:24.340]   Watch all five and then talk to me about it.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:28.100]   In my old days as a TV critic, you know, I would have watched it.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.100]   You would have had to.
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.100]   See, that's it.
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:31.100]   You don't have to anymore.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:32.100]   So you don't.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:34.900]   Yeah, unless I want to exactly freedom.
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.340]   Yeah, because he had to watch thick.
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:40.100]   He had to watch crappy shows.
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:41.700]   The worst, you know, the worst week.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:42.700]   And you'd have to watch it.
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:46.100]   I did it the days of the really long mini series.
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:47.340]   And I had a policy.
[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:54.940]   I never fast forwarded 14 hours of AD was the worst torture of my career.
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:57.140]   And you didn't have an iPad or anything else.
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.500]   I mean, you had to watch.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.020]   That was the days of people watching.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.020]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:03.020]   There was nothing else to look at.
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:06.580]   Its mom is family or nothing.
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:10.180]   So I missed a cultural phenomenon.
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:11.180]   It's okay.
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:13.020]   We forget you.
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:14.180]   This is better than moonlighting.
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.820]   I'm telling you, it's better than moonlighting.
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:18.540]   It's that good.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:19.700]   Was there anything better than that show?
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:22.060]   I don't know.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:25.780]   Maybe Rupert Murdoch and John Hamm together last.
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:31.260]   Rupert Murdoch unfit to lead a large company.
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:39.420]   Apparently, SOS Raseem, which is a French NGO, has accused Google of reinforcing the notion
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:43.700]   of an international Jewish conspiracy that control the media.
[00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:49.060]   Because when you search for Rupert Murdoch Jewish or John Hamm Jewish, those queries are
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.740]   more likely to show up in autocomplete.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.660]   See it proves it.
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:55.100]   This they are not Jewish.
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:58.940]   But Google is anti-Semitic.
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:03.340]   This is I think people just we got somebody has to explain how autocomplete works.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.740]   Oh, they have to explain how the whole damn internet works.
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:18.540]   The Google Street View thing is just driving me completely baddie.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.380]   It's gotten so conspiratorial now and it was legal.
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:22.380]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.020]   Schmucky, but it was legal.
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.580]   So there's autocomplete things.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:32.060]   If you type in John Hamm or Rupert Murdoch's name, one of the suggest options is Jewish.
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:35.140]   That's because people are searching it.
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:36.900]   They're saying, is he Jewish?
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:42.100]   Maybe they're looking for a nice Jewish boy with chiseled features or who looks like a
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.100]   sharp pay.
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:44.100]   I don't know.
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:49.260]   Either way, John Hamm, the name John Hamm just isn't kosher.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.020]   There are so many great sips.
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:57.540]   It's homophobic things out in the world, which were intentionally so that like getting wound
[00:59:57.540 --> 00:59:59.980]   up about something like this is seems crazy.
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.220]   Also John Hamm's wife is her name is Jennifer.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:08.820]   So if you type in JE, one of the suggestions is her name and then it's Jewish.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.860]   So instead of having gaydar in this case, you need goidar.
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:19.900]   Sorry, I'll just come for that until you cut me off.
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.220]   Let's see here.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:25.180]   Can we talk about the Google Nexus thing or is it?
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.940]   Yeah, I mentioned it in passing.
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.380]   Google, Apple wants the Nexus source code.
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.740]   Google says, what the hell?
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:33.100]   We already gave you all that stuff.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.300]   Apple says, no, we want it all.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:38.060]   Google says, yeah, it's protected just like the iPhone OS is protected.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.360]   No.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.740]   And then there was another judge, Judge Posner.
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:46.820]   Did you see his slap against Apple saying Apple was frivolous, better cut it out, knock
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.820]   it off.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.020]   No, no, I don't think it was in the Google case.
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.020]   I can't.
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.020]   Maybe it was.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.020]   It might have been the Samsung.
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:57.260]   Apple says they're tired of litigation anyway.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.660]   Then cooks, I see never liked it.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.660]   Good.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.660]   Stop it now.
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:07.500]   Hopefully they put Apple and Samsung in a room together, lock it and they can either
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.500]   kiss and make up or do worse things.
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.380]   It's what companies do when they can't compete.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.580]   Look what Nokia just did.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.140]   You know, 27% market lost last quarter.
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.140]   So what do they do?
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.140]   They sue.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.140]   Can't beat them.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.620]   How until Apple sews the New York Times?
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:21.620]   Oh, man.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.380]   All out war.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.380]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.500]   Well, and Wall Street Journal and Facebook.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:30.300]   Did you see the Wall Street Journal article saying, you know, Facebook fads don't work.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:36.620]   It's just like, it's like, come on.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:37.620]   Okay.
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.620]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.620]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:49.100]   Um, just want to cover a few more before we go into our picks of the week.
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:51.100]   Google Cube.
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.260]   This is not addictive.
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.020]   This is not an April Fool's joke.
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:02:01.660]   If you go to play maps cube.com, you probably have to do it in Chrome, right?
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:02.660]   It's a Chrome.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.660]   I'm trying it now.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.580]   It's Safari, which means it's a Chrome experiment.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.580]   Nothing happens.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.100]   Your browser is unsupported.
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.100]   You lose.
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.420]   Your browser is not worthy.
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:18.060]   Here's a video on YouTube of what you're missing.
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.220]   If you weren't Jewish, you'd probably enjoy this.
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.220]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:24.620]   Now, see, now I'm going to get in trouble.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:25.620]   So what is this?
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:26.620]   It's a cube.
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:30.060]   It's like, oh, it's that marble game with maps.
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:35.820]   Yeah, it's kind of the travel around the city, either biking or going to a bowling alley
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.500]   or walking or driving.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:42.420]   I spent, I was trying to prepare for the show and I spent 30 minutes playing that game.
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.180]   That was unacceptable.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.180]   Yeah.
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.900]   I got caught up in it.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:47.900]   Not allowed.
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:51.900]   You may not, you may not play the games we refer to in the show notes.
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:52.900]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.220]   Now I want to play it.
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.700]   I have to launch Chrome first.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:57.700]   I don't have Chrome.
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.700]   Oh, yeah, I do.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:02:59.700]   Here it is.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.420]   I'll save it for after the show.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.060]   It's worth playing, it sounds like.
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:04.060]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:05.060]   It sounds like it's a good thing.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:06.060]   Yeah, it's fun.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:10.420]   Oh, what about the Winklevoss twin saying the cloud is going to be huge?
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.500]   So I guess when you get a big, what was it?
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.860]   How much money do they get from Facebook?
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:15.860]   Oh.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.860]   40 million.
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.700]   How much is it going to be, right?
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.300]   Do they get it in the equity or do they get in cash?
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.860]   I think, yeah, it's equity, right?
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:22.860]   So how much is it?
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.060]   I haven't seen that calculation.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.820]   How much are they going to be worth at $104 billion valuation?
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.900]   Well, you could tell because now they become venture capitals.
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.540]   Fat capitalists.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.540]   And I'm sorry.
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.940]   You know, don't these guys just live for staying in the news?
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:37.940]   Oh, God.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.300]   Like every few months they pop up with something crazy.
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:45.180]   These guys are like, they're just asking to be made fun of.
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:50.620]   I mean, I hate to be insensitive, but God, that quote is horrible.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:54.020]   And it's just, we think the cloud is going to be huge.
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:55.020]   Well, thank you guys.
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.740]   And it was our idea and they stole it from.
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:58.740]   He stole it.
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:01.860]   We had an idea for a website.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.340]   If you were the inventors of Facebook, you would have invented Facebook.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.340]   Yes.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:10.780]   Thank you, Mark Zuckerberg as embodied by Aaron Sorkin.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.460]   You can easily make Winkle Book if they want to.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:15.700]   Winkle Book.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:21.100]   The funny thing is that at the end, the CNBC reporter asks for their autograph.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:27.380]   It's just too easy to hate someone who is that rich and good looking and duplicated
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:29.420]   and Harvard educated.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.420]   Sorry.
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:33.060]   And there's two of them.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:34.060]   Okay, sorry.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:35.060]   I'll start up.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.660]   And their twins.
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.500]   All right.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.180]   Yeah, let's let's take a break and come back.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:44.900]   We're going to do your picks, your tips, your numero.
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:50.420]   And I'm going to let the Facebook organ donor app Facebook organ donor app.
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.740]   Oh, yeah, we didn't talk about that.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:53.740]   Huge success.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.740]   800% do.
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:56.740]   That's really awesome.
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:57.740]   That's great.
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:58.740]   And just in California.
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:05.780]   100,000 signed up on the first day peer pressure via social network.
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:09.420]   They add an organ donation tool to Facebook, which I haven't seen yet.
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.180]   So how did you see it?
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:15.500]   Is it show up in your, in your, well, I think they'll recommend it to you.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:20.140]   You have to go to your health settings and then you can say that you are an organ donor.
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:22.780]   And if you're not one, you can sign up to be one and you can share it with friends,
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:23.780]   family or the world.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.780]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.780]   Facebook has health settings.
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.780]   Mm hmm.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.820]   I never knew that.
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:30.900]   What, what the hell?
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:31.900]   What do you mean?
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:35.220]   Oh, I guess most of, mostly it was, I have a zip today.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.220]   Heart condition.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.860]   You know, but you didn't see how long mine are.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.460]   Oh, I think I'll hunt forever.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:41.460]   You're not joking.
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.940]   Facebook actually has health settings.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.660]   No, I don't know where to find them.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:45.660]   Yeah, they're there.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.660]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.820]   All right.
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.820]   So maybe it shows up in my app requests.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.740]   Like, my video shows you how to do it shows.
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.460]   Hey, Jeff, have you seen, is there a place where I can donate all of my extra fat that
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.460]   I have?
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:00.460]   Oh, get lying.
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:01.460]   I love this.
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:02.460]   Get in.
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:06.100]   I want, I see you lose a little bit of hair.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.100]   I want to donate my ear hair to a program.
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.860]   That's disgusting.
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:14.460]   I do not want your hair.
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.460]   Okay.
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:19.700]   If I search for organ, Facebook help organ donor.
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:23.300]   Yeah, if you just go up there and look for old.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.980]   Here's how to share that you're an organ donor with your friends.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.620]   Huh, you do it on your timeline.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:30.340]   Oh, it's a life event.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.340]   That's what it is.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.340]   Yes.
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.340]   Yes.
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:34.340]   Okay.
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:35.340]   Sorry.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:36.340]   Yes.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:37.340]   Under life event.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.340]   I think it has health.
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:39.340]   Okay.
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.340]   Let me go back.
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:42.780]   So I have to go to my timeline.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:45.060]   I want, I'm just going to show it so everybody knows how to do it.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.260]   Hey, we brought Facebook down.
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.260]   Everybody's doing it.
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.260]   Oh, sorry.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.260]   Okay.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:56.740]   And then it would be in here and somewhere in my health life event.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:57.980]   Where do I add a life event?
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.580]   I'm a bad person since I didn't do it.
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:00.740]   Oh, here it is.
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.580]   Life event.
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.460]   Work in education, family, health and wellness.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:05.460]   You're right, Jeff.
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:10.580]   New eating habits, organ donor, weight loss, glasses.
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.460]   Wait, you can donate status.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.660]   I'm going to donate the liver.
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.660]   I didn't eat last night.
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.300]   You can actually enter as a life event.
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:22.540]   What body part you broke, where you broke it, who you were with, when you did it, the
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:25.700]   story and then upload photos of it.
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.540]   Who knows?
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:30.380]   Overcoming illness, quit a habit.
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.580]   This is, this is big news, the health.
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:36.380]   So I registered as an organ, organ donor many moons ago.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.740]   I'm going to say 97.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.980]   If you're not officially registered, it's easy to sign up here.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:43.020]   And this is the key with the appropriate registry.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:47.260]   So you've got to Facebook.com/donatelife.
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.260]   Donate life, America.
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:51.380]   This also means if you don't have a card on you, there's now a place to chat.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:52.380]   Oh.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:53.380]   See what you are.
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:54.380]   Yeah, it's on the California.
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:58.220]   It's on the back of our driver's license, but this would be good.
[01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:59.220]   So I can go register.
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:04.580]   I wrote a post, you know, just fascinated by the norms this causes that, that, you know,
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:09.100]   when super amete needed bone marrow transplant and it was a great campaign to do it, I have
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:12.980]   to admit, in the back of my mind was, oh, you know, what if I did that?
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.060]   And then I kind of win the match.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:18.180]   That's what you don't want because I have a feeling that's not much fun.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.460]   So which, but that's a horrible thing, right?
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:21.460]   So the, I felt pressure.
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:25.420]   I didn't do damn thing about it because I'm in schmuck, but I, I felt pressure to do
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:26.420]   it.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.700]   And so I asked, you know, whether one could be shunned if you don't join in.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.340]   And then Seth Golden came in and said, you damn well should be shunned.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.540]   You should be shunned.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:38.740]   You son of a gun drowning child, which I see the point.
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.180]   I mean, I don't know what to think.
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.780]   But it's a really interesting use of social pressure.
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:44.780]   Yes.
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:52.020]   I signed up for bone marrow transplant many moons ago and have not been called, but you,
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:54.820]   you do it and you kind of hope that you don't get called, I think.
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:55.940]   You don't want to win that lottery.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:58.700]   But on the other hand, if you get called, here's what I've been told.
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:02.420]   Yeah, it's a little painful, but you're set, you're literally, this is it.
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.340]   This is one of the few things that literally can just like save a guy's life.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.700]   Like it's just, if it's a match, it just, you put it in, you put in the new barrel, it
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.700]   grows, he's done.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:11.700]   He's fixed.
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.700]   And you get yours back.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:13.700]   It's a cure.
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.500]   For example, would be a kidney or a lung transplant.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:18.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.820]   Which is a lot worse than getting marrow sucked out of your bones.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:21.820]   That's true too.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:22.820]   That's true too.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:25.100]   So I'll take that anytime.
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:29.260]   So I'm filling this out right now, just so I'll be in the, in the database, even though
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:33.100]   I'm also, like you can't hurt to do it twice.
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:37.260]   And this is for your eyes, your ears, your nose, your anything tissues.
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:38.900]   Nobody wants my nose.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.260]   Too big.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.260]   This is good.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.220]   And so 100,001 day.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:45.220]   This just shows the power.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.220]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.780]   This is definitely an example of using power for good.
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:50.500]   I was really impressed with Facebook for doing this.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:51.500]   And I'm grateful.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.500]   I'm glad that they did.
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.500]   I'm going to give them a nice.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.820]   I went on the takeaway this morning on NPR on public radio.
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:56.820]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.460]   And, and John, John.
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:00.460]   Take away guy.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:01.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:03.460]   Take away guy.
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.460]   I don't remember either.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:05.460]   Ockaberry.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:06.460]   Ockaberry.
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.460]   Thank you.
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:11.580]   Well, could Facebook use this for bad purposes to like target ads to you?
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:14.100]   I said, what's the demographic, generous people?
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:21.580]   You know, actually maybe, you know, how can we always be so cynical about everything?
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.580]   Everything.
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.740]   Well, the good news is this, this information is not going through fate.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:27.740]   Well, maybe it is, but it's from donate life.
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.620]   In my case, donate life in California.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:34.140]   I'm not giving this information to, well, you are to Facebook.
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:36.620]   You're also telling Facebook that you're an over.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:37.620]   I am.
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.860]   Well, it says that you just said you were.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.620]   Yeah, you just said yes.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.940]   Yeah, but then I'm a donor.
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.700]   Oh, but not the, like, not like the personal information I give here.
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:47.700]   Right.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:48.700]   Exactly.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.660]   But the fact that you are a donor or that someone else isn't.
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:55.940]   Does it show up in your new stream when you do this?
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:56.940]   Oh, probably.
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:57.940]   You could decide.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:58.940]   Yes.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:10:59.940]   Yes.
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:00.940]   Yes.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.940]   If you, if you choose to do that, depends on who, who you choose to share that with.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:08.460]   Yeah, and then something wrong with my driver's license.
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:11.500]   I love it when the bill gets to the weeds.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.340]   I just want to do it right.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:15.340]   I want to do this in case I died.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:17.940]   You know, I could go out the door and get hit by a bus.
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:23.060]   I want to make sure that I, if I do, that my guts will go to somebody who needs them.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.060]   There.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:27.220]   Now I'm, now I'm signed up and I can have, oh, notify friends and family.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.220]   I probably should.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:29.220]   That's right.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:33.380]   I'll notify you and you and you and all of you.
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:35.940]   You sound like Oprah.
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:37.940]   You open.
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:42.740]   You've all got an organ of your choice under the seat.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:43.740]   Good.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:51.900]   So now I'm in the registry guaranteeing under the California Uniform Anatomical Gift Act
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.300]   that your wishes to save lives will be honored and you will not require that could send up
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:57.460]   any other person.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.860]   Let this page keep it in your wallet.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:01.860]   Now I'm curious.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:04.260]   Now this is a good question.
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.260]   I'm curious.
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.860]   Is this going to show up in my Facebook?
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:09.060]   Leo, just as you said to share it.
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.060]   I did.
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.060]   So probably is it.
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.060]   All right.
[01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.060]   That's good.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:14.060]   You could go private.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.340]   That's where all this pressure is coming from, isn't it?
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:18.060]   Your friends are already doing this.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.060]   Right.
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.060]   Peer pressure works.
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:22.060]   What's wrong with that?
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:23.940]   This is Jeff's living in public.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.660]   I mean, this is one of the best.
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:26.660]   Right?
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:34.500]   And I mean, to be cynical about it, it may not be about targeting ads, but it is about
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.500]   it.
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.660]   It seems like it could be about attracting health related advertisers.
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:39.660]   Really?
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:42.260]   Because I gave up my spleen?
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:45.820]   Well, I mean, you're so you opted to be an organ donor.
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.940]   You are probably very likely to want to donate blood for example.
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:50.620]   So the Red Cross might contact me.
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:51.620]   Right.
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.620]   And that's not it.
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.620]   They don't spend money on that.
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:54.620]   I think the cynical.
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:13:00.020]   If you insist on being cynical, chat rooms said you were on a tear today, Jean, and I
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:01.580]   love you being on a tear.
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:06.420]   If you insist upon it, then I would say that what a really what what son Jake said was
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.420]   that it's a PR point.
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:09.420]   Well, it's good.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:10.420]   They're about to go to IPL.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.420]   So it just kind of makes.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.460]   You know, I don't think it's a show up in my stream.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.500]   Actually, I can't see it.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.940]   I don't see it showing up anywhere.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.260]   I don't see it in your stream either.
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:20.260]   It's weird.
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:21.260]   So there you go.
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:24.260]   Maybe they maybe God, maybe this is purely altruistic.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:27.300]   Maybe Facebook just wants to save lives.
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.300]   What?
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:31.740]   That can't know this ruining my whole world.
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:36.820]   So then you remember longer and then they can if they extend lives, then they actually
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:39.860]   have the lifetime value of a user and they've extended that.
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:45.460]   So they've thus if they have 800 million users and 1% of them live one year longer than.
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:46.460]   Oh, that's it.
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:47.460]   That's really cynical.
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:51.780]   You know, so the thing of this is that.
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:54.180]   Facebook cures cancer so it can make more money.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.060]   I post everything on Facebook.
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:58.220]   They know everything about me and every.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:02.220]   I mean, you know, it's like I gave up Facebook.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.340]   If you wanted, if you were like the CIA and want to know where Leo was at any given moment,
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:11.060]   just go to my Facebook, public Facebook page like 91,000 other people.
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:12.060]   Facebook.
[01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:13.540]   Yeah, your car, Rumba.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.060]   That's me and Tom Anderson, by the way.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:22.420]   There's a certain, I think there's a certain, I don't know, poignancy pecants, pecan't flavored
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:24.780]   and have Tom Anderson on my Facebook.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.540]   My Google, Facebook page.
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:31.340]   I still wish he'd be on the show and he's looking at me.
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.660]   Looks like a cop drama.
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:34.220]   It does look like a cop drama.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.060]   Streets of Petaluma.
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:39.540]   Hey, hey, hey, told the chickens.
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:40.860]   Trey Radcliffe took that great picture.
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:41.860]   I just love that.
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:42.860]   That is correct.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:43.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:47.100]   And I just think it, you know, it's kind of an in joke that I have Tom Anderson as picture
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.100]   on my timeline.
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:53.500]   That's my space, Tom, for those people who don't know the name.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.780]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.460]   Come back with your tips and your numbers.
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:00.180]   And you know, if Lamar, you'd like to come up with a, I don't know, something you, an
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:04.860]   app or a tool that you like a lot, maybe the cube or anything, we'll let you do that
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.860]   too.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:06.860]   Thank you for that pressure.
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:11.300]   But you don't have to and you've got three minutes to figure something out.
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:12.300]   No pressure at all.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.300]   Thank you.
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:18.780]   This portion of this week at Google brought to you by the good folks at Citrix.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.380]   We love them.
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:24.860]   They do so many great products, including the best remote access product ever.
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.540]   That's going to change the world because it's going to take cars off the road.
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:33.260]   Gas prices going up, commute, length of time, getting longer.
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:36.100]   Wouldn't you like to stay home, work from home every once in a while?
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.980]   We'll do it one day, awake 20% savings and gas alone, not to mention stress.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:44.620]   And you can have that sandwich you like so much for lunch because it's right there.
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:45.980]   That's what go to my PC allows.
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:49.860]   It allows you to access your work computer wherever you are, not just home on the road
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:55.180]   at the airport in Norway, even in Christensen in the middle of nowhere.
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:59.540]   I was able to get online and check my computer, not just by the way on my PC or Mac, but on
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:02.100]   my iPhone and my iPad.
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:03.540]   Now that is cool.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.700]   My Android tablet sets up in minutes.
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.500]   No IT help is required.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.540]   It's secure 128-bit SSL.
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:13.060]   It's actually a secure way to surf if you're an open Wi-Fi access point.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.300]   Pull out your iPad, launch the free GoToMyPC app.
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:17.860]   You're now connected to your office computer.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:18.980]   Use that to surf.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:21.660]   It's completely secure all the way to your office computer.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:22.740]   And that's cool.
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:29.660]   In fact, if I'm in Norway and I want to watch a US only site or like that, that's how you
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:31.580]   do it.
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:32.580]   It's like VPN.
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:33.580]   It's better than VPN.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:34.580]   It's easy to use.
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:35.580]   Not traversal.
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.540]   You don't have to open ports on firewalls or anything like that.
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.180]   It's really a slick solution.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.300]   You could try it free right now.
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.500]   Just go to the website.

[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.860]   And then you've got it for 30 days free.
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:56.860]   The iPad app is free.

[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.260]   The Android tablet app is free.

[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:07.740]   computer.

[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.260]   Congratulations coming up later today.
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.260]   Bill Harris will be joining us.
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.540]   He is an interesting fellow.
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:21.900]   He's got a product that competes with mint, with Intuit.
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:22.900]   Ooh.
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:23.900]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.300]   It's what it's called personal capital.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.300]   It's more for business.
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:29.140]   Same word business.
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:38.380]   But a multi-time startup guy, very interesting fellow, former CEO of Intuit and PayPal, kind
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:41.820]   of competing with his old company with personal capital.
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:44.060]   We'll talk about that just a little bit.
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:52.100]   At 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern Time, 2300 UTC at twit.tv.
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:56.300]   Now it's time for Jin, Japan, his tip of the week.
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.900]   I've got a silly little Easter egg as my tip of the week.
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.700]   I like silly little Easter eggs.
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.900]   It's really fun though.
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:06.500]   Type Zurg Rush into Google.
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:10.260]   Zurg are from Starcraft.
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:11.260]   Starcraft.
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:14.260]   Z-E-R-G-R-U-S-H.
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:16.260]   Wait a minute.
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.260]   Oh my God.
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.260]   Here they come.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.260]   Oh, they're taking over.
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:24.060]   So now if you pointed them with your mouse, you can try and you can try to get them before
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:25.740]   they destroy everything on the page.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:27.340]   They're eating the page.
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:33.060]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.060]   you might get that last one.
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:36.060]   Can I get him before he eats up the...
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:36.900]   - Whew.
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:40.240]   But apparently there's quite a few left.
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.820]   Way down here.
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:43.460]   - Oh, oh, oh.
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.140]   So you can follow them down the page.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:46.200]   - Oh no.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.200]   - It's a little game.
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.360]   - Du, du, du.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.940]   So there must be a Starcraft fan.
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.200]   - There has to be.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.420]   - This is somebody's 20% time.
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:55.160]   - Yeah, this is somebody's 20% time wasted.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:55.960]   - I had to.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.140]   Yeah, so for the people listening to the audio stream,
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:01.220]   the little "O"s from Google are flying down the screen
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:03.760]   and zurg rush in Starcraft is an attack
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.760]   of insect-like creatures.
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.060]   - Insect-like aliens, yeah, they're horrible.
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.420]   The zurg are horrible.
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.220]   - And so the little "O"s come down
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:13.960]   and kind of eat everything on the page.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.220]   And then when you inevitably lose, as Leo has done,
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.300]   they all sort of gather into it.
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:21.660]   Well, maybe I shouldn't give this part away.
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.460]   - I have to suspect they're gonna spell Google, right?
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:26.060]   I'm just guessing.
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:26.900]   Look at this.
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:28.500]   This is so cool, actually.
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.960]   - The best letter in the alphabet is about to show up twice.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.460]   This is about to make me itch.
[01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.560]   (laughing)
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.560]   - It is a little...
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.300]   (humming)
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.540]   - You know, we used to drop quarters
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.860]   to play a game this good.
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:47.940]   - And GG stands for good game.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.900]   - Oh, it does.
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:51.980]   - This is a person who has a 20% life.
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:52.820]   - It's not Google.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:53.780]   They didn't spell Google.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.220]   They could have spelled Google.
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:56.060]   - That's terrible.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:56.900]   - But they spelled good game.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:57.820]   That's funny or GG.
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:58.660]   - Good game.
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:19:59.620]   Yeah, and then you can share your score
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.260]   on Google+ shockingly.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.580]   Yeah, unfortunately my score sucks.
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:05.580]   - Oh, no, they've heard again.
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.420]   - Let's just see.
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:08.860]   I defended a Zerg rush on Google search.
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:12.500]   I took down three Zerglings with 41 APM.
[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:17.020]   That's probably like the worst score ever.
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.340]   But I'm gonna share it because I'm an idiot.
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:21.260]   (laughing)
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:22.860]   There you go, Google+.
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.760]   Don't tell me I don't use Google+ on a regular basis.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.820]   Let's see.
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:31.020]   We're gonna get a number of the week
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:33.240]   from Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.080]   - I can't decide.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.880]   So I'm gonna go through a whole bunch of them.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:36.720]   - Do them all.
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.100]   - Seven and a half, which is how many years
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:42.080]   Dig lived before its staff now moved to the Washington Post
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.160]   and poor Dig is--
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.680]   - How many did they all move?
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:48.120]   Basically there's no staff left.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.000]   - You know, it's really interesting.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.760]   Kevin Rose essentially dissolved all three companies
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.640]   he started within a month.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.480]   - Yeah.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.880]   - Sold milk to Google is now at Google, by the way.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:57.720]   I don't know what he's doing.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.240]   I asked him and he says, I can't tell you,
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.400]   but let me know when you want Google glasses
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.360]   'cause I'll get him for you.
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.640]   (laughing)
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.720]   - The rumor is that he's doing Google+
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:07.560]   his team is working on it.
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.060]   - I think that rumor is wrong.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:10.900]   But he says they won't let me talk.
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.860]   He says, just consider me your inside source at Google.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:17.120]   Maybe that's just, 'cause he were friends.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.720]   And then Dig, everybody leaves.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:23.560]   Dig is like, anybody know a programmer?
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.120]   (laughing)
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.280]   We kind of need a programmer.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.120]   And then the latest rumor is that revision three,
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.240]   which is the media startup he started.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.240]   Dig, Dig Nation, and they did a lot of shows
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:36.680]   he and David Prager put that together,
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.400]   is about to be sold to Discovery
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.200]   for something like 20 to 40 million.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.040]   So that'll be it.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:41.880]   Kevin will be out.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.120]   He'll be like an employee.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.920]   And he'll have millions of millions of dollars.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.400]   So Kevin-- - Well, he won't have as many
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.440]   as of course the other number we are like, Kevin,
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.080]   is 60 million, which is how much business we've said.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:55.120]   - Business week said famously that he was worth.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.200]   - Well, that dig is-- - That's one set of numbers.
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.680]   - And then we have 6.25 million,
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.120]   which is the amount that Facebook has invested
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.720]   in Jim Gilliam's company, Nation Builder,
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:05.600]   which is kind of cool.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:06.720]   He's the guy who did the great video,
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.000]   the internet is my religion.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.400]   - Oh, that's right. - PDF.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.800]   - Good for him.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.640]   - I like that.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:15.400]   And then we have 70% in American Express surveys
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.640]   say that they use social media to get customer service.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.400]   Now the irony of this to me is I went on social media
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.120]   that complained about American Express and they ignored me.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.120]   (laughing)
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.000]   And I don't use my green card anymore.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.800]   I've been a member since I don't know when.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.120]   - I don't use it.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:34.320]   - But you are still in the A-A-A-R-P, right?
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.640]   - Hey. - Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.560]   (laughing)
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.200]   It's the camera that makes the hair look gray.
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.360]   - I'm not complaining.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.640]   The groceries store across the street every Thursday,
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.800]   10% off if you're over 55.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.000]   (laughing)
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.600]   I'll tell you, taking a senior discount for the first time,
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:53.000]   which I did last week, a couple of weeks ago,
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.960]   is both simultaneously delightful and depressing.
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.800]   - That's what you get.
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.520]   Did you get the X-Lax or the--
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.160]   (laughing)
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.520]   - Depends. - Depends.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.680]   Lamar, did you in this,
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.880]   we gave you some time now, did you come up with a tool?
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.240]   - I didn't, but I do have a mini rant.
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.400]   - Okay.
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:14.240]   - Ooh, let's hear it.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.640]   - We like 'em. - Okay.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.640]   - I won't go on a full, you gotta do it.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:19.680]   - Full Lamarism here, Lamar.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.520]   - Come on.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.360]   So you know, we were-- - We were waiting
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.280]   to talk about the Twitter story
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.160]   where they were considering buying the app camera plus.
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:28.800]   And so I had a like a rant prepared for that.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.960]   I don't understand all these different tools
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.520]   that we have for pictures.
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:38.080]   Like Instagram is a social network just for pictures
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.600]   and camera plus and you have all these other ones.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:44.480]   What happened to just using the good old fashioned apps
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:48.240]   that are built into the phone, the regular camera?
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.280]   Like when I take a picture of my iPhone,
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.400]   it goes to Google+, which is where I wanna store
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.480]   all of my pictures.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:56.480]   And I just, and if I wanna send it to Twitter,
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:59.600]   it goes to Twitter, which uses a photo bucket.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.960]   So Facebook has their own.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.280]   So I just never like got into Instagram
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.520]   or all these extra features when the phones
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:09.640]   or in these services that we use have their own features.
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:14.640]   So my rant is use Google+, use the photos.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.480]   It's free, it stores it.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:20.400]   Why are we creating other networks
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.320]   when we have stuff that's already available?
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.800]   And that's my, that's my rant.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.480]   That segue's so nicely to buy tool of the week.
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.320]   Does it?
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.320]   Pinstagram.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.960]   Oh no.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.120]   Combine Instagram.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:33.960]   I'm leaving.
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:37.640]   With your Pinterest account, the two together.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.160]   No Lamar, it's really great.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.240]   Look at this, Pinstagram, it's even got
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:45.800]   skeuomorphic leather stitching like we all love.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.520]   So now I don't have to go to Instagram or Pinterest.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:52.040]   I get both in a single page.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.040]   Oh.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.040]   Pinstagram.co.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.880]   Hey, you got Pinterest in my Instagram.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.600]   You got Instagram in my Pinterest.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.800]   Two great tastes in one.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.840]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, on that note,
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.440]   that was the rant and the anti-rant.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.400]   That was a, that was a really a perfect segue.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:13.400]   That was a really nice thing.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.400]   It really was.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.400]   It really was.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.400]   It was fun.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.400]   It was fun.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.600]   I did that to you on purpose.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.320]   I set you up and then I knocked you down.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.520]   Go to Wilson Tech one.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.040]   He's @wilsintech1 on Twitter.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:30.680]   He's also of course, youtube.com/wilsintech1 and making silly faces.
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:31.680]   Look at that.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:32.680]   Oh, hey, baby.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.680]   Oh, baby.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:34.680]   Oh, baby.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.200]   Is this the noon?
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.960]   Is this the Barry White Lamar Wilson that we've been waiting for?
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:39.960]   No, it was.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.640]   It was based on that stupid, hot problems video.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.440]   I was trying to be a hot tech guy.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.440]   Yeah, baby.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.760]   You know, what a guy like me.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:50.200]   And by the way, that is chess here that is not a disease.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.040]   Everybody's here.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.880]   Everybody in the comments.

[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:55.880]   Measles?
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:56.880]   What is that?
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.880]   Check it box.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:25:59.880]   Lamar.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:02.200]   A great pleasure.

[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.920]   I'm so honored to be on there.

[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.880]   Yeah, you are a great addition.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.080]   You can be in charge of the rant.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.280]   We got tip tool number and now rant.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.280]   Yes.

[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880]   It's not a buzz kill.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:25.080]   It gets you excited about life.

[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.440]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.160]   Gina, to my organs, please.
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.120]   You're saying in the chat room, make that guy a weekly regular.

[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.680]   I love you, Lamar.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.120]   I suck in that.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.480]   By the way, Barry White never dressed in white, according to Logan 5.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.480]   Really?
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.480]   Just so you know.
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.480]   I don't know why.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.680]   If that's true or not, it's just a great-- it's good.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.520]   It's like one of those false facts.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.680]   I have to answer it about that.
