[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stacey and Jeff or here, Anne has the week off.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.920]   There is lots to talk about including the Sonos update that's making me so angry.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.160]   I'm not alone on this one.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.360]   The moral framework of journalism should Glen Greenwald go to jail in Brazil.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.720]   The state of New Jersey has a Twitter account.

[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.160]   This is Twig.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.280]   This week in Google, Episode 543, recorded Wednesday, January 22nd, 2020.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.880]   Back to Mites.

[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.760]   As time for Twig, this week in Google will show where you cover the Googleverse Facebook,
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.040]   Twitter, oh yeah, Google.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.080]   Jeff Jarvis is here, not in Davos.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.600]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.280]   Usually in the years past, we've done this from the cafeteria in the middle of the night
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   in Switzerland.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.280]   The newsroom there.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.480]   No, but no, I'm on the need not to go list.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   No, that's not fair.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.480]   Pissed off somebody.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.480]   Yeah, well, you know what?
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.560]   I bet you that's not a bad thing.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.560]   It's a kind of...
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.880]   These days may be a little bit of an embarrassment.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.880]   It is.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.680]   There's 100 billionaires there.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.680]   Although...
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.680]   The last time I went to the late...
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.680]   Greta Thunberg went too.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.480]   She was staring down at Trump.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.960]   There's a great picture of somebody put up on Twitter right behind her of her just looking
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.640]   at Trump and you could imagine the evil eye that she probably gave him.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.240]   Yeah, because he called her what a spoiled little girl.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.480]   Just stay home and watch movies with your friends.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.480]   Yes.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.560]   But the word is all of God most loves Trump this year.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.560]   He's talking about Mark and Scott and they think he's just five.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.800]   Millionaires love the president.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.640]   Jeff is the letter to our professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.400]   of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   [laughs]
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.720]   Blogger, Buzz Machine, author of What Would Google Do?
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   Private parts.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   Public parts, I mean.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.880]   There it is and a lot of other wonderful things.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.520]   Stacey Higginbotham is also here.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.800]   The Queen of IOT.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.320]   Stacey.on.iot.com at Gigastacey.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.120]   Is it should I?
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.800]   Would it be better to call you the king of IOT?
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   No, no.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   I accept the queen of...
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   Okay.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   And I've been the queen of the cloud, the queen of something weird.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   Okay.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.840]   I don't mean that in a diminutive way.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   I just...
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840]   Oh, of course not.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.240]   The queens are very powerful in their own right.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.600]   Just leave it with Elizabeth.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:28.520]   We have the longest reigning queen in the history of Great Britain on the throne as we speak.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520]   Perhaps the world?
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.520]   Perhaps.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   We don't know?
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.120]   No one knows because records haven't been kept since they've...
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120]   I just finished...
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.800]   Highly like books.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.760]   What about the life of Charles V and what about the Philip II?
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.000]   Charles V is the one they named as Spaniels after, I believe.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.080]   Yes, I guess so.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080]   They would have.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.800]   That's all I know, madam.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.400]   You like Spaniels.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   That's it.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.680]   Oh, but Elizabeth doesn't get a corgi named after her?
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.680]   She should.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   She should.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.680]   She's really true.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   She's a bit corgis.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   I think she should.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680]   She's definitely...
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680]   She did a lot with Bree.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.040]   She's done so much for corgis.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.080]   And the most poignant thing is that she decided to stop having them because she knew that she
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.760]   was gonna leave them and didn't want to do that.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.760]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   So no more...
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.760]   Yes.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760]   No new corgis.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.760]   No new corgis.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.760]   No.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   No.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.760]   Are there any corgis left?
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   No.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   She hasn't outlived them yet.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.160]   No, there are no corgis left.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.360]   There are only two dorkis.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.360]   Oh, what?
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.360]   Dorkis?
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.840]   There are dorkis, dachshund and corgis.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.160]   Oh, that's not a good mix.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.240]   If you could make corgis like shorter...
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.000]   Would you really...
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.280]   Thank you.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.880]   Alphabet is now.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the newest member of the Quattro-Cama Club.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.480]   A trillionaire, trillion dollars.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.800]   So Apple did it, Microsoft did it now.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.200]   Now Alphabet's done it.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.600]   That's the silly number.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.440]   It is.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.840]   But it is amazing.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.680]   You know, from what was going to be a pizza delivery service in a dorm room.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.680]   Was it?
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.680]   What?
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.680]   What?
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   That was their first idea.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.840]   The third idea was to do a pizza service.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.840]   Well, I guess I'm sad that they didn't.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.840]   Yes.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.840]   It would have been the best...
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.840]   It would have been a great...
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   A pizza service.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   Yes.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   Wow.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.840]   Wow.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:37.300]   Actually, Punter Joe is explaining that dorkis, that is Dachshund corgi mixes, are...
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.200]   Think of it as a stretch corgi, the showy limos of dogs.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.000]   Oh, I like that.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.840]   So Amazon, Hittitreyan before...
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.840]   Amazon did it too.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.840]   Yeah, I forget.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.360]   All of the companies that Elizabeth Warren wants to break up.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.120]   It's a shorthand way of referring to it.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.720]   Anti-success, anti-capitalism.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   Oh, I'm still...
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   No, she's...
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   I can't.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.520]   But yeah, I just agree with her there.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.760]   I don't know what to say.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.160]   I feel like...
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.200]   You know, there was this congressional hearing in Boulder, Colorado, where they ganged up.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.640]   Did we talk about that?
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.360]   Colorado was out on Twit.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.440]   I think we talked about it on this show yet.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.640]   They ganged up on Google, Amazon.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.920]   David Hanomier Hanson said, "The most unlikely thing ever.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   Help us, Congress.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.080]   You're our only hope."
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.680]   They got the guy who invented pop sockets to come in and said, "It's just hard to do
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.000]   business on Amazon."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.840]   We tried to get off Amazon, but it cost us $10 million.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:50.120]   So it's so hard for us to be on Amazon, which it sounds like Amazon made him $10 million,
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.040]   but that he's not happy about it.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.200]   The complaints from Tile, which makes those...
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.120]   What are those little Bluetooth trackers?
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   Apple had the temerity to put "find my iPhone" in the iPhone instead of saying, "Well, you
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.360]   can get the Tile.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.520]   Just glue a Tile in the back of your phone."
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.320]   The iPhone doesn't allow devices close access to the radio on the phone.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.760]   Tile works with an iPhone, though.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.760]   It does.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.800]   I'm just saying that there's a little bit more subtlety to this complaint, but keep going.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.160]   Well, yes.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.040]   The thing about the complaint is...
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.240]   And this historically has been always...
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.040]   The people complained about windows in the day that they had secret routines that the
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.080]   only Microsoft could use on their apps, and this was true.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.840]   But Apple has an even better excuse than Microsoft does, which is we want to lock up the radios.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.640]   We want to isolate apps from one another.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.320]   We want to lock our phone down because it's better for security.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   Yeah, sure.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.600]   On Android, any app can access these radios, and that's that Apple says, and I think with
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.960]   some justification, a security flaw.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.480]   And it has caused Android problems.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.680]   So it's not crazy.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.400]   So anyway, these were...
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.360]   It reminded me, and I even attempted to pronounce like Son Jieckz-Rach.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   Blah!
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.360]   Läistung Schutz-Rach.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.720]   There's a new version coming.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.320]   Well, this is what it reminded me of of all of the publishers in Germany going to the
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.000]   EU saying, "Oh, this Google, they're competing against us.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.760]   Please, do something."
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.520]   It feels like that these companies, the headline in the post, companies burned by big tech
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.040]   plead for Congress to regulate Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:47.000]   But it's not completely clear to me that these companies are stomping.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   No!
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.920]   God didn't give those companies the revenue they had.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.920]   They lost it.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.680]   Better competitors came alone.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.680]   This happens.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.360]   Sonos is suing Google saying they copied their multi-room plays.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.360]   Well, speaking of being pissed at companies, are you...
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.280]   Are we going to that already?
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.280]   Am I a little...
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.800]   Is your Sonos stuff going to be...
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   No, because in order...
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   No, so...
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.680]   But I think what they did is wrong.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:20.640]   So the way it worked is they offered a 30% off to upgrade my existing Sonos to the new
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.880]   Sonos with new capabilities.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.160]   If you accepted that, they then pushed an update down to the Sonos that bricked these
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.240]   speakers.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.200]   It made them, you couldn't even use them as external speakers.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   You couldn't...
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   They said, "Well, we don't want to see all this..."
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   I never liked this company.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   No, that's not nice.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.760]   They've always been overpriced.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.920]   They've always been selling air.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.640]   I know you guys liked them all along, but I never took you one of them.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   I resisted them.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.640]   I just didn't like them.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.680]   Well, now you don't need them anymore because they're secret sauce.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.640]   Whether it was stolen or copied or reinvented has now propagated to the rest of the world.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:00.600]   Their whole thing was they were the only system because they had a proprietary wireless network
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.680]   that you could have speakers in every room and they would all be playing and there wouldn't
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.880]   be out of sync.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.280]   There wouldn't be this weird echo-y thing.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:11.120]   It would sound like one giant house speaker system, which was awesome.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.120]   Really awesome.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.800]   And nobody had done it in wireless before.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   But they're...
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.720]   The Sonos guys, and by the way, I don't think...
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.560]   Correct me if I'm wrong, Stacey, but I don't think they've backed down on this.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.680]   The Sonos guys said, "We don't want to see all of these old speakers on the aftermarket.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.240]   People buy them expecting the modern Sonos experience and they can't do it."
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.320]   I obviously have lots of feelings about this.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.880]   Because you have lots of Sonos speakers, right?
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.960]   I spent $2,000 in the last probably two...
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.400]   No, not two years.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.360]   Since 2009, I've spent about $2,000 on Sonos equipment.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.360]   All of which is now...
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   Oh, you're a punter.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   You're a punter.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   John, how much do you spend on Sonos equipment?
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.840]   I mean, I think zero...
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.760]   Oh, they gave us...
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.360]   Okay, never mind.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:00.440]   The studio speakers they gave to us, my speakers at home, I've bought almost $5,000
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.000]   of the Sonos speakers.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.840]   Well, Stacey, were you just saying...
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.480]   Were you just saying it's now obsolete?
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   No, yours are not obsolete.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.480]   So, okay, here's...
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   Okay, let's start from the beginning.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   Let's say what's happening.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.480]   That's where you like to start.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.480]   They are no longer.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.480]   I do.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.480]   I like to start with the fact.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480]   Yes, it's like...
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.480]   Let's...
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.160]   From the very beginning, a very good place to start.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.160]   It is indeed.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.080]   That's why Stacey starts there.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.400]   So, Sonos sent out an email yesterday.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.720]   Oh, I haven't seen the new thing.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   They sent out...
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   Oh.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   You didn't get the email?
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.360]   Then your stuff may not be obsolete.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   I didn't...
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.360]   Well, I haven't looked.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.520]   I don't look at my email, but once every month or so.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   What?
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.520]   I don't like email.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.520]   Next, he's gonna give up email.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.520]   Okay.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   I got a link and see you.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.520]   He gave up Twitter and Facebook.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.520]   Next, he's gonna give up email.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.520]   He's just watched.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.520]   I'm pretty good.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.400]   Sonos, on Tuesday, everybody got their email saying, "End of software updates."
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   Oh.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:59.560]   What is happening in is, if you have a product that was introduced between 2005 and 2011,
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.520]   and there is a list of products, and Sonos tells you which of your products will be affected,
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:11.480]   those devices after May will not receive software updates into new features.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:19.880]   So Sonos has said, though, that they're looking at a way for you to create a legacy network
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.840]   where those devices will work, but they will no longer be part of a whole home system if
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.160]   you have newer devices in your home.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   Yes.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.200]   The other thing to think about is those legacy devices.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:39.400]   If an API changes, like a Spotify API or title changes something, it won't be updated.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   Oh, no.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:49.120]   It's possible that your Sonos and likely that over time, your Sonos gear from that era will
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.120]   become less useful too.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.360]   It will gracefully degrade.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.840]   Gracefully or not so gracefully?
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.560]   Well, I mean, it's graceful in the sense that it's not gonna shut off in May, right?
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.000]   They're not, but over time it is going to become less useful.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   So then they'll offer--
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.600]   Did you get an offer for discount on new stock?
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.600]   Okay.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   I did.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.600]   Yes.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600]   And then they offer, they have the options.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.800]   Continue using legacy products.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   Screen month winner.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.480]   Or that is not an option.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.000]   Trade up legacy products save 30% on the new product when you upgrade through the Sonos
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.680]   trade-up program.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.160]   Then it's subject to terms and conditions.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.720]   Some of those terms and conditions are not awesome.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.880]   But the reason why in this gets to something like, I sold my Play 5, my original Play 5
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.120]   studio device a month ago online.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.280]   Oh, so that person's best.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.280]   Exactly.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.280]   And I really said--
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.600]   So that was their point, yeah.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600]   Why?
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.600]   They don't-- like, if I were not an ethical individual, you know, and I told my husband,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.960]   I was like, don't recycle.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.640]   Don't do that because you're gonna screw this person over.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.480]   So just sell it and make sure they understand that they're buying a first generation product.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.320]   I just looked at the email.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.520]   How many things are yours?
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.520]   How many things?
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.000]   The Connect and the Den, the Bridge, the Bridge, the Connect Living Room, the Play 5
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.800]   Bedroom, the Play 5 Bathroom, the Play 5 Kitchen, the Play 5 Bedroom, the Play 5 Kitchen.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.520]   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.320]   Oh, 9.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:24.280]   In fact, I think of all of the Sonos devices I have, only a handful will continue to work.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.560]   No, no, they're gonna-- so they're gonna work.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.200]   They're just not-- they might degrade.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.040]   See, this is the-- OK, so this is the Disconnect because I thought many did.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.160]   We were buying speakers.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.320]   We weren't buying speakers.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.680]   We were buying computers.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.840]   And like any computer, like a Chromebook after eight years, like an Android device after
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.160]   three, like an iPhone after a few, they go out of date.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.160]   Was it a proprietary Wi-Fi or was it-- so that's the problem.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.160]   It was.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.100]   And that-- well, no, that's the only way they could do that at that time.
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.760]   That was their secret sauce.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:02.240]   They later on, when they did the Play 5, built a whole new speaker system and chip for that,
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.400]   which was really exciting for parents.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.800]   So those were presumably less--
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   No, that was--
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.360]   But they still no guarantee, right?
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.200]   No, there's no guarantee.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.720]   And here's the issue.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.920]   Or here's one of the issues.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.320]   Speakers and audio are actually-- media is difficult because codecs change all the time.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.360]   So it's not like all of the other-- like if you release a product, how long do you want
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.520]   to be on the hook to support it?
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.640]   And that's a legit question.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:34.680]   And people think of things like speakers, thermostats, light switches, as devices that
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.920]   should last forever.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.120]   And what we're running into is the fact that they are computers.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.520]   So what do you replace?
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.120]   And how smart do you want this to be?
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.720]   A standard will help here.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.880]   So I was talking to somebody about the idea of the connected home over IP standard that
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.440]   Apple, Amazon, and Google said they're going to work towards.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.160]   Something like that wouldn't help exactly in this situation.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.080]   You'd need like audio standards.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:09.680]   But I also think, is it possible for Spotify to say, hey, X percentage of our listeners
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:19.000]   listen on Sonos devices, maybe we'll keep a version of that API stable for Sonos users.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.240]   This gets into this idea that what we're actually building are services, not individual products.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:31.680]   And that they're part of an ecosystem of relationships that need to be maintained over time.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.680]   Right.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.680]   This is something you deal with all the time in IoT.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.040]   And these are really just early IoT devices.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.520]   They're maybe among the earliest of the IoT devices.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.880]   So did you see Richard Lawler's piece on Engadget?
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.760]   No, tell us about it.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.240]   His headline is, "The morning after Sonos Legacy Plan makes smart homes look silly."
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.880]   They put that on there just to say.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   It does.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   Yeah, because we're all good.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.880]   Everybody, right?
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.880]   For everything.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.980]   This is four years.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.240]   This is why I've been asking companies, and we did this on the show today.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.600]   So if you listen to my show, you're going to hear this all over again.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.480]   So skip ahead.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.160]   In either show, I don't care.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.440]   Companies have been telling people that connected devices are amazing because you can add features
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.440]   over time.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.600]   Yes, your oven gets better.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.160]   Your Amazon Echo gets better over time.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.480]   The flip side of that is, at some point in time, it will get worse.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:31.720]   And companies need to be mandated to tell you when these things expire.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.360]   Because right now, we don't have a standard.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   Yep, a lot of these.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.360]   I'm looking.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   I bought two years ago.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.040]   Oh, if you bought it, okay.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.880]   So if you bought it two years ago, oh, and it's being end of life because they're saying
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.920]   if you bought it from a Sonos, like a legit Sonos dealer.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.240]   So I have, you see, this is why I should be shot.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.440]   I bought way too many.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.800]   So I have four, five modern products and 11 out of life products.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.400]   I bought way too much.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.400]   Wow.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.600]   So, but now I'll never buy it.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.720]   I'm not going to upgrade these because it's just going to happen again.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.600]   You just killed me as a customer, Sonos dead.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.800]   I'll write this one down and I'll never buy another Sonos product again.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.080]   Jim Laramak, when crazy on Facebook about it, he was just so enraged.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.800]   I have never seen, so I mean, this has happened a bunch of times also in the great breaking
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.240]   of yesterday.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:30.880]   UA, under armor, said they were going to break their under armor connect devices.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.880]   It's a scale.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.280]   It's a bunch of other stuff.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.800]   And they weren't going to let people export data, which was a problem.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:42.400]   And then last week, we had Comcast, not, sorry, sorry, Charter Spectrum say that they were
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:49.680]   going to kill their smart home security service, which includes thermostats, sensors, cameras,
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.840]   etc.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:56.800]   And people who invested in least that equipment, they were like, they're obviously upset because
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.360]   they're out thousands or a couple hundred thousand dollars.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.760]   How many people have taken advantage of the trade up because, yeah, it's 30% off, but
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.760]   it's not much.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.680]   It's not much on these expensive devices.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.120]   Yeah, that's the problem with the stuff.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.120]   It's always been overpriced.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.040]   Some of this, like, I don't think they even make some of this stuff.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   I don't know what I would trade up to.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.440]   No, some of them really don't because remember, and I think we talked about this a year ago,
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.440]   they stopped making, I think it was the connects.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.800]   I have a bunch of connects.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.920]   I have boosts and I have docs, which they stopped making also.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:31.560]   Stacy is so right that what there should be is an industry principle of ethics of giving
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.600]   you some kind of warranty of what you're going to get.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.440]   Both that Google just said for new Chromebooks, not all of them though, Chromebooks, they're
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.600]   going to update for eight years.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.440]   I think it's even longer than they need to.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.600]   But Microsoft does Windows 10 years, but there's no end of life on the hardware.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.200]   It's just on the operating system.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:56.320]   So you could then put Linux or even a newer version of Windows on there.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.400]   So wait a minute, seven devices ready to recycle.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   Should I push this one?
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   Did you just?
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   No, no, no.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   Because it'll brick them.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.400]   It'll, it'll, well, I think you have 30.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   You're not going to operate.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   Are you?
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   Well, they're all in operation.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   Right now.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.400]   Well, then let them let go.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.400]   That'd be what it'd be.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.400]   Let them be.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   Well, I just want to know.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.760]   So does, so this is the thing.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   I want to know, well, what is you going to be replaced with and how much is that going
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.760]   to cost me?
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.600]   Do I have to brick it before I could find out because they haven't told me yet?
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.840]   I've just checked all the boxes and then it says recycle.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.840]   Stop.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.840]   Stop.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   Don't do that.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.840]   Okay.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.840]   But I want to know.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.840]   Okay.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.880]   What is going to cost me your places?
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.040]   Then stop.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.760]   Go look online for products.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.600]   But what are they proposed to replace the connects with?
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.600]   Okay.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.600]   That is a decent.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.600]   What is it?
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.520]   The connect function ties your...
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.240]   It basically means you can use your own speakers.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.320]   It's the Sonos part of the Sonos system minus the speakers.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.120]   So you connect it to the internet and you connect it to your speakers.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.360]   And now it's not an amp, it's just an interface to streaming music.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.280]   But I like that I have that in my living room.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.040]   I have on my stereos, right?
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.040]   Yes.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.040]   So connect.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.040]   Okay.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.040]   Connect.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   That doesn't matter.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   I'm not...
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.840]   The point really here is if you're using...
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.760]   The smart thing to do is replace this with 10 Google Home Maxes.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.840]   Oh God, no, that is stupid.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   Replace it.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.000]   I just said that so she could say that.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I just wanted to say that.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Okay.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.280]   It has a speaker input thing so you could buy that and that's like 25 bucks a pop.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.280]   I believe...
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.920]   But does it work with Sonos?
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.480]   Oh, you want it to still work with Sonos?
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.480]   Well, yes, I have this whole Sonos.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.920]   John, we're going to have the same problem.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.160]   These are all Sonos play fives.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.800]   They're all going to be out of date.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   He doesn't care because...
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.760]   But again, they'll keep operating and they just won't update.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.200]   And we don't use them with Spotify.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.840]   We use them with our own music libraries.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.840]   So who cares, right?
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.840]   They'll still work as speakers.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.200]   So if you're running this against like a NAS drive or something, you're fine.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.200]   That's fine.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.200]   Okay.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:10.240]   I feel like the Sonos amp is what you would use to...
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   With your speakers.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.680]   Yeah, but that's a little more than a connect because it includes an amplifier.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.360]   Yeah, I know it's a little...
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.920]   So I think that's your option.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.600]   Yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600]   You know what?
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.840]   This has honestly been brewing for a while.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.760]   Sonos discontinued the dock which I used with my...
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.240]   It had a 30-pin dock for your iPhone.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.120]   And I had an adapter to work with Lightning.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.000]   But I guess it kind of works.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.720]   And then, yeah, these connects, they never replace them.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.600]   The boost, I don't think they ever replaced the boost.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.000]   In fact, they don't even know I have a boost.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.720]   They're like, "What is this weird product?"
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:50.200]   They were throwing some stuff against the wall and it never really slid down.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.840]   The nowadays though, correct me if I'm wrong, Stacey, there are a number of devices that
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.160]   duplicate this whole house music feature without...
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.680]   Oh yes, you get lots of devices that do this.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.120]   This isn't hard to do this.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:07.680]   I kind of knew when I was spending thousands of dollars for what was, let's be honest,
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.880]   only an okay speaker system that I was getting hoodwinked.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   I knew that even then.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   Well, it just was convenient.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   It was convenient and the value was...
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:24.400]   I mean, when they created Sonos, it was really exciting because the Internet was...
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.600]   I mean, this was the early days of the Internet.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.600]   You got to...
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.600]   Oh no!
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   This was 2005!
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.040]   And I had some great parties because we could turn all the speakers...
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   I too, great parties.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.520]   We could turn all the speakers on.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.400]   And the whole house was rocking.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.920]   That's why I ended up getting those outdoor Sonos that they just offered, which I have
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.080]   yet to use.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.560]   They just kind of sit on their charging stands because nobody ever comes over anymore.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.560]   Oh.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.560]   Sonos stock is down 2.3% today, but it's still higher than it was a year ago.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.560]   I'd consider blowing up.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:59.280]   Yeah, that's only because until recently everybody thought they'd suffer for Sonos.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.280]   Everybody...
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.280]   I mean, because they don't have any secret sauce anymore.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.280]   No.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:08.880]   And everybody assumed that Amazon's Echo and the Google Assistant would kind of eliminate
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.000]   the need for Sonos, period.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.880]   So what's the great update that they think that they're going to make that makes this
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.880]   worthwhile pissing off all their customers?
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.880]   Amazon Echo.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.880]   Well, no, no.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.880]   They just...
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.880]   No, no, no.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.880]   They're adding Echo capability.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.880]   Oh...
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.880]   What have I talked about?
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.880]   Sonos now.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.440]   I have Google Assistant and Echo in it.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.080]   That's the new stuff.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:34.800]   Well, they've also expanded their product line significantly for things like the IKEA
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   line.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   They have the IKEA line of connected speakers.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.760]   Do I look like somebody who would buy IKEA speakers?
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.440]   I don't think they're cute.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.440]   Although Kevin said...
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.920]   I mean, the bookshelf one is fine.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.000]   Do I look like a college kid?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   I...
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   There's Sonos speakers.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.720]   I hear a whole man, I'm just teasing.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.520]   I buy a lot of stuff for IKEA.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.280]   But I get somebody else to assemble it.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.440]   We went to Sweden on vacation.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.440]   I was so amazed with...
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   Oh, IKEA is amazing.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.440]   And those meatballs.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.440]   Meatballs.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.440]   Right.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.440]   So good.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.440]   Do you...
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.440]   Do you have...
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.640]   Do the speakers come in a flat pack and you have to assemble them?
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.440]   No, they just...
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.280]   They're already made.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   Look at Google.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.680]   Google the IKEA book show.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.680]   They're so...
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.680]   So do speaker.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.320]   They're cute.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.920]   I think it would be though in hindsight a bad idea to buy anymore.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   So do speaker.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.920]   Well in that...
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   I mean, I don't know...
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.920]   Oh, they are cute.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.920]   They're little lamps.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.680]   Oh, no, those are hideous.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.680]   But the...
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.680]   No, the lamps are...
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.680]   But the bookshelf one is cute.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   The symphonus...
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   The symphonus.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   The symphonus.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.000]   They always have to give them weird Swedish names.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.360]   You don't like the lamp?
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.320]   No, the lamp is hideous.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.320]   What is that?
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.320]   That...
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   No.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   Good.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.200]   I like how they put it next to a bunch of candles that actually have been used, which
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.400]   is interesting.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.360]   You asked me an actual question, but I don't remember what it was.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.800]   That's because we keep it around.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.800]   We don't have an IKEA fun.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.080]   We're having too much fun with IKEA.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.360]   Oh, West Elm sells Sonos gear.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.680]   Who knew?
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.040]   And they're pretty inexpensive.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.480]   There's a West Elm just down in Samrifel here.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   So...
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.320]   But what is the...
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   What am I...
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.640]   I'm gonna get a raspberry pie and some clipshorns and do it myself?
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   What is the alternative?
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.840]   Put it up in half.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.840]   Wires.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.840]   No.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.680]   Well, for speakers?
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.680]   Wires.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.680]   Is there...
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.440]   Okay, so yeah, there's the Echo input.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.280]   Yeah, I could put those all over the place.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.480]   And those will drive a powered speaker system.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.120]   So, you could then get nice powered speakers, which will never become obsolete because they're
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.120]   just speakers.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.040]   Right, and that's the idea.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.560]   That's kind of like why I don't want a smart TV.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.120]   I like having my Roku box.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   Yeah, 'cause you got to upgrade that.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.200]   So that's this.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.360]   For Google, Google doesn't have anything tight like the...
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.680]   Actually, Google, Home Max is a really nice speaker.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   It's a great speaker.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.080]   Because as good as any of my Sonos speakers.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.920]   But aren't they already built in?
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.920]   Aren't you...I'm trying to help you use your existing built-in speakers.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:23.680]   So I could still use...if I don't do the trade-up, I could use all of the Sonos speakers, just
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.840]   plain old speakers, right?
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.600]   John, I'll just connect them as we're going to do here and have the source be spotify
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.080]   until that's deprecated or whatever.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.080]   And then I'll use something else.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   I'll use my own.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:40.000]   And there's a company called BlueSound that does wireless sound around your home.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.040]   So you could...I suspect there will also be a third...what was...when the Pebble went out,
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.360]   there was a Rebel, right?
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.600]   This third-party firmware that you could try to keep your Pebble watch working really...
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.600]   Well, that's...
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.400]   They'll be Ronos.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.400]   Ronos.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.400]   There's a...
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.040]   It's better than Paulos.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:04.200]   These are expensive, but the BlueSound system has something called the node 2i.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.520]   See, that's kind of the same problem, isn't it?
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.760]   Because it's going to be some proprietary protocol that will someday be obsolete.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.640]   This...you connect to an amplifier of AviReceiver or any powered audio.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.800]   So this does...
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.600]   Yeah, and then you would replace the node sound.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.440]   This is the Roku in your analogy, basically.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.440]   Right.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.600]   And then you use...oh, it's $549.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.400]   It is expensive.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.400]   Yes, I would...
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:34.000]   My caveat here is these are high quality audio products and priced as such.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.520]   I mean, when you get into that...I mean, like, I remember my dad buying a Rotel amplifier,
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.520]   I think it was.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.520]   Yeah, oh, I had my Rotel.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.520]   God, I wanted to go to college, dad.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.760]   It's a Rotel honey.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.880]   I had a Rotel amplifier with a proton television.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.680]   That was the state of the art in 1980.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.560]   And John Curtis had it now.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:01.360]   So you know, it is really kind of foolish to say, "Oh, Sonos, how dare you obsolete these?"
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.360]   This stuff...
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.960]   It's electronics that they got.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.160]   But it goes back to your original point, which is as these companies are whining about Google
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.040]   and Facebook and Twitter, they're doing things themselves.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.080]   Yeah, they're all just as bad.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:19.320]   Sonos is suing Google because they dared to compete with Sonos by creating full house
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   sound.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.320]   For $25.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.160]   Yeah, that's really true.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.120]   In fact, really...and maybe you can help me with this, Stacey.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:35.320]   At some point, I think I'm going to give up on the whole idea of, you know, chip this
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:41.200]   new alliance and all that and just pick a winner and say, "I'm going in all in on Amazon
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   or I'm going on a Google."
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:46.640]   If you pick a winner, my suggestion to you, do you have an iPhone?
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.480]   Yes, I also have an Android phone.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.480]   Of course it's not.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.480]   What do I have?
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.480]   Yes, phone number may.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.880]   No, I don't have any phones.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.480]   So I would say if everyone in your house is on an iPhone, pick home kit.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   It's local.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.480]   Home kit.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.840]   It is the easiest to use.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.680]   I personally don't like it just because I have issues with Apple, but from a user...
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.680]   It's so serious.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   A usability.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   It's so stupid.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.840]   Well, yeah, that does leave you with Siri.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.240]   But you can do a lot just from your phone and you can just set the automations and then
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.280]   you can have your Google's for a useful piece.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.880]   Actually, they're very good with the automations.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.000]   The shortcuts and everything actually are better than anybody's, I think.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Exactly.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.760]   So if you set that up, most of your stuff, and a lot of your home kit capable stuff can
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.160]   be also linked to Google.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   So you could have...
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:40.360]   Yeah, because I have Google Nest cameras, Google Nest doorbell.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.440]   I have echoes everywhere, but I've kind of duplicated functionality in every room.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.920]   So there's an echo sitting next to Google.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.360]   In some cases next to Cortana.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.880]   In some cases next to a home home.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.800]   My kitchen has all four in the kitchen.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.240]   It's your electric bill in a month.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.440]   Oh, you don't want to know.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.520]   You know, I should plug my insights switch in and see how...
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.520]   They don't...
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.960]   I don't think they use that much electricity.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.960]   But this is...
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.080]   Well, I don't know about the O's.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.240]   I feel like...
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.880]   I feel like this is all inevitable.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.360]   And I understand Jim Lauterback's anger.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.320]   I'm a little miffed because we all spend a lot of money on Sonos, but really we were
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.800]   the suckers even then.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   That's what I said.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.800]   I never bought them.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.800]   You're right.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.800]   I didn't say anything to you guys.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.960]   It had to make fun of you, but I always thought this S is over.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.960]   Right.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.960]   And I'm being honest.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:38.280]   I said, we only use the whole house sound right very rarely once in a while.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.960]   And in that case, we're listening in a single room when anything would work fine in a single
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   room.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.400]   It's possible that this is their attempt.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.600]   So Sonos is having trouble competing against Amazon and Google.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:58.160]   And it's possible they need to rally the troops, condense their resources, kind of bring all
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.280]   their resources in-house to focus on some sort of strategic differentiation, at which
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:07.560]   point they looked at supporting all of this and said, "Hey, that's going to cost us X
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.280]   dollars a year that we just don't have."
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:17.000]   So we're willing to take this hit now, jettison the legacy stuff that we don't have the means
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.320]   to support and then push forward with something else.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.600]   They just might be between a rock and a hard place.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   I think you're right.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.160]   And again, when we say obsolete them, it's really a clea- I mean, it's important to say
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:36.200]   and that's why I would like for you to keep yours going, Leo, is we don't know how it's
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.520]   going to fail and how long it will take.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.960]   It may not take.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.960]   Why throw it out if it works?
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   It still works.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.960]   Yeah, it may just be a feature you don't care about.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.960]   Right.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.960]   I don't use the bottom five.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.680]   I'm sure you're likely to care about.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.160]   Amazon is going to have.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.160]   Right.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.600]   And you already have it in every room.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.080]   And that may be when you want to upgrade and you may, like the next sonos that they're
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:01.840]   like deciding to like focus on and build may be so amazing that you're like, "Holy crap,
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840]   I'm back in."
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.840]   Unlikely.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:09.800]   Well, I think you're going to have, we're going to see this debate play out 100 times
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.720]   in the next few years as consumers run into these walls.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.840]   Phillips Hugh has already told people that they are not going to support their hubs
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.760]   beyond three years after purchase.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:27.160]   So a lot of the smart home companies are coming out and saying, "Okay, this is how
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.240]   long you can expect us to support this."
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.640]   And I think that's a mature, like that's a maturation thing.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:39.720]   And we all need to figure this out both as the buyers of this stuff and as the sales
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.720]   people.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.720]   It feels like it's just another nail in the coffin of home automation and IoT.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.720]   It could be.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.160]   I think consumers are kind of aware now, "Oh, I mean this is, Microsoft pissed everybody
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.320]   off because they said, "Yeah, we're not going to update Windows 7 anymore."
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.920]   And I hear people complaining about eight years on Chromebooks.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.640]   I hear people complaining about three years on Android phones.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.800]   You're complaining about eight years on a Chromebook?
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.040]   Well, that's the expectation.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.760]   We're changing our expectations right now about what and where we should stick smart
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.760]   and computers in our product.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.260]   Here's why it's offensive.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:18.120]   In general and offensive to me is the physical hardware is fine.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.560]   It's not worn out.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.400]   The speakers work, the Chromebooks work, the phones work.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.200]   It's economically, it's ecologically.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.280]   It's an ecologic nightmare.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.360]   They're all going in landfill even though, see a car wears out, a refrigerator wears
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.360]   out.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.360]   They're not worn out.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.920]   They're pristine.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.640]   In most cases, they have not in any way gotten worse.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.760]   In fact, you could probably argue the speakers actually sound better.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.280]   What's worn out is the software.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.880]   Well, no, they're arguing and I don't know how true this is because I'm not seeing their
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:53.160]   update sizes, but they're arguing that there's not enough processing power in memory to do
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.960]   some of the new features.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:00.880]   Yes, but no, that's the same argument with why Microsoft doesn't support Windows 7 is
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.800]   that times have moved on and so we need to move on.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.160]   We're not going to support the old stuff because we want to do new stuff.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.960]   That's technology.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:15.480]   I just think that consumers, it may be that our frame of reference is old school.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.480]   Oh, it's hardware.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.120]   It shouldn't wear out when it should be.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.120]   Oh, it's software.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.040]   Of course, it wears out, but it's somehow offensive, I think, to a lot of people, certainly
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.040]   me.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.560]   Oh, it's totally offensive because it's perfectly good hardware.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.240]   That's why I think manufacturers have a huge role to play in changing the conversation
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.800]   and talking about expiration dates for these devices because otherwise people buy it thinking
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:40.440]   they're buying hardware because people, I mean, we're smart, but we don't want to think.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.640]   When you buy something like this, when you buy a speaker, you don't want to think about
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.640]   all of this.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.400]   You don't want to think about privacy and two factor in how long it's going to last and
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.960]   when's my next software update.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.880]   You want it to work and that this is a huge branding challenge for the smart home and all
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.560]   the companies building these products.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.800]   The challenge also is if Sonos comes out and says, "Hey, we're going to support our speakers,"
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.440]   if you buy this today, this has a 10-year useful life, let's call it.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:12.680]   I'm going to look at that and then I'm going to look at the blue speakers, whatever the
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:17.080]   blue sound stuff, and if they don't have that same information, I'm probably going to buy
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.000]   the blue sound because I'm like, "Well, they're not going to stop supporting it in 10 years."
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.360]   When maybe they only have a five-year term, but they bury it in terms and conditions.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.360]   Plus, a company can just die.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.720]   Yeah, I don't think Sonos even knew that this would happen.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.520]   No, this was not...
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.520]   Well, I think they knew that people were going to be unhappy about this.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.120]   I don't think going in when they designed it.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.560]   But I thought those speakers started.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.040]   They couldn't say, "Oh, this is only...
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.600]   I'm only going to stop supporting for 10 years."
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   They didn't say that.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.600]   But they could have designed differently.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.880]   They could have designed more modularly.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.880]   You know modular.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.880]   You're right.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.400]   And that's kind of what you're talking about.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.480]   Keep the speaker, plug in this more memory, plug in the smart TV.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.480]   Because you can...
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.840]   It's a cheap job greater Roku while the screen is still...
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.560]   It's because we still have this durable goods mentality that there's some things like a television
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.960]   and a computer are durable goods like a refrigerator are durable goods.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.920]   Those things should last.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.160]   Software is not a durable goods.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.160]   So make it modular.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.160]   You know, though, I bought a...
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.400]   People don't like modular.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.680]   No, I bought a Samsung OLED TV.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.720]   It was $10,000 when the OLEDs first came out.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.040]   It had no electronics inside.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.560]   It had a box that attached to it that was in theory upgradable.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.000]   But of course, they never updated it.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.120]   They never upgraded it.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.120]   There is no replacement.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.600]   Because by the time they were going to do that, well, there's better OLEDs now.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.600]   So...
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.600]   So much cheaper.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.600]   Right.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.600]   Cheaper than that box would have cost you.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.600]   Yes.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.520]   I actually wrote about this in the newsletter last week.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:53.360]   There's a story about it's actually chips that are upgradable inside.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.640]   It's basically creating silicon that you can upgrade.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.320]   You can turn on more memory or turn on more processing power.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:05.480]   I saw that at CES and it was pretty compelling for things like exactly the Sonos issue, right?
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.960]   But ironically, John McFarland, who is the former...
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.440]   He's one of the founders of Sonos, former CEO there.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.440]   He tweeted at me.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:18.360]   He was like, "This is just an effort by Qualcomm to charge people more and I hate it."
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   Which I thought was...
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.440]   It is a point.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.520]   This kind of flexibility is going to be more expensive.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.240]   You'll pay for the upgrade, right?
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.560]   You'll send them money and they'll turn on more features.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.560]   Right.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.720]   And this is a common model.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.560]   I mean, remember when we had this whole core debate for software and you were like, "Oh,
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.760]   now I'm going to put my software on more seats or I'm going to...
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.760]   I need more cores.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.760]   I want to put it on more cores."
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.280]   Well, look how far than your Tesla.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.920]   Elon does that all the time.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.920]   Right.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.080]   Except Elon's smart.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.120]   He gets the money up front.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   There you go.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:54.840]   He's charged a lot of people $5,000 on the promise that you'll be able to upgrade it
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.840]   autopilot.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.440]   I don't know.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.440]   Maybe you will.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.400]   I don't know.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   Did you...
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.400]   You didn't buy that when you bought your model as...
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.080]   No, because my model S was not capable of being upgraded to that.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.080]   No, but when you...
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   That's the thing.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.080]   You have to buy it when it's new.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.120]   If I were to have bought a Model 3, for instance, I would have had to make that decision.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.920]   Do I pay an extra $5,000 for what Elon said?
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.920]   Full self-driving.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.600]   We'll have full self-driving in a couple of years.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.320]   But it'll cost you a lot more if you get it then.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.320]   You have to get it now.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.360]   Have you traded in your Tesla yet?
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   Oh, yeah, it's gone.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.360]   Well, it is.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.360]   What are you driving now?
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.360]   I only leased it.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.360]   It was a three-year lease.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.360]   Oh, three-year.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.360]   And that's...
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.560]   You know, at least it insists you won't let me buy a car because for tax reasons and business
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.560]   reasons.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.560]   Right.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.320]   And honestly, she was right about any...
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.320]   For a Tesla?
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.680]   For a Tesla because there's so much improvement down the road and so forth.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.000]   So, yeah, I'm driving a gas vehicle.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.480]   But at the end of the year, I mentioned this.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.520]   At the end of the year, Ford is coming out with its first real electric vehicle.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.080]   They call it a Mustang, the Mach-E.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.000]   It's a crossover.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.240]   It's got every feature I want.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.000]   So I've already put the deposit down on that.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   I think that...
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.520]   What's the likely price of the $59,000 for the one I'm getting, which is first of
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.520]   the edition.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.520]   It'll go...
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.520]   You can get it for less.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.320]   I think this starts at $39,000.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.520]   I saw the vault.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.880]   What's the Volvo, new brand?
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.880]   That's nice, too.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880]   Yeah, they have a funny name.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:20.880]   Polar?
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.880]   Is that...
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.880]   No, no.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.880]   Polestar.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.880]   Polestar.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.880]   It's beautiful.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.240]   Yeah, I like Volvos.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.400]   I don't know.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.480]   I could live in a Volvo.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.520]   I could live in a Volvo.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:37.040]   I could literally live in a Volvo.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.360]   But honestly, when you're in podcasting, it's probably prudent to buy a car you can live
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   in.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.360]   There you go.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   A lus...
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.360]   A lus...
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.360]   A lus...
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.360]   You get bought by the New York Times.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   What did they just buy?
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   Don't tell me.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.360]   I'm going to call you.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.360]   Well, they're looking to buy.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.520]   They're looking to buy the makers of cereal.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.520]   Kelloggs?
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.280]   I thought Gimlet produced cereal.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.280]   That's what I thought.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.280]   No.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.280]   It was bought by cereal?
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.280]   No.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.280]   It's bought by...
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.280]   No.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.280]   It's big and...
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.280]   I wonder what the Times are going to pay.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.960]   Spotify is rumored to be buying...
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.520]   Story on the U1 now.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.520]   Ringer.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:20.400]   So, that's Bill Simmons Sports Culture Network.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.840]   You know, it's gross.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.480]   It's revenues are not that much more than ours.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   They're very similar.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.480]   Same size company.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:34.080]   I bet you they get sold for $100 million.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.080]   I'm just going to ride...
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.080]   Everybody, always for sales.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.080]   Twit is like sell-ups.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.720]   I would like a do.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:44.920]   I'm going to ride it down to the ground and then we'll recycle.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.920]   Right.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.920]   People stop listening now.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.480]   We're going to be obsolete soon.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.480]   No.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.200]   Well, you will work with your ears forever.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.040]   It's really an interesting shake-up in the...
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.040]   But didn't Jeff...
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.960]   This happened in blogging as well where there were a lot of independent blogs and then they
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.120]   just kind of all got the success that one's got started.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.840]   Then there were plenty more.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:14.600]   But you don't see that same kind of fertility in the blog space these days.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.000]   No, no, not at all.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   Fertility?
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   I was going to let it go.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   I was going to let it go.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   I like thousand flowers.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Oh, you're going to let it go.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.920]   In the early days of Bloggerie, which was what?
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:30.200]   '95 to 2005, something like that.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:35.920]   Also US podcast advertising revenue was about 678 million last year, according to eMarketer.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.360]   I have to say that that's a complete guess.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.360]   No one knows.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.360]   Yes.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.360]   No one knows.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   No.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.720]   We made last year almost 9 million in revenue.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.720]   Wow.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:46.720]   According to...
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.440]   Yeah, I know.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.880]   I don't know where it went.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.880]   It just...
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.160]   The Sonos, that's where...
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.320]   Yeah, I bought a lot of Sonos.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.480]   Give your last year.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.040]   Actually, that's off from our peak, which is almost 10 million.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.640]   But Ringer was 16 million, they say anyway.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.840]   And I bet you, Gimlet...
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:13.840]   I think the reason Gimlet got sold for 230 million is because they had no revenue.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:14.840]   You get much...
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:21.360]   Because what happens, companies do a multiple of Ibita.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.040]   If you have Ibita, then there's a multiple.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.200]   If Ibita is zero...
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.200]   Ibita is earnings before income and taxes.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.200]   It's what you make.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.200]   Your profit.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.240]   And so it's maybe, I don't know what, 5 to 10 times Ibita.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:41.280]   But if your Ibita is zero, if you're losing money, like Uber, like everybody in Silicon
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.720]   Valley, then the sky's the limit.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.760]   You're literally worth more if you're losing money than if you're making money.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.400]   Well, for me, as long as you're growing.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.000]   Yeah, growing.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.400]   We lose money, but we make it up in volume.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.400]   Right.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.600]   Those losses just get bigger and bigger.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.600]   Yeah, we lose money.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.920]   Every person we add, we lose more money.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:04.920]   Buy more Sonos.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:05.920]   It'd be fun.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.760]   It's a very strange world we live in.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   It is.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.320]   Well, it's based on...
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.120]   And these are serious questions we should be having, right?
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:18.200]   It's based on the current internet business model, people's business model, eyeballs.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.320]   So if you think about that, as opposed to like a product-oriented one or a subscription-oriented
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:28.920]   one, and what's happening is we're coming to this area, era where we're like, "Holy
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:35.400]   crap, there's so many crazy business models and we're just now uncovering how they're
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.760]   working in the repercussions on us."
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.920]   When historically, we've pretty much, if you see something you like, you buy it, you
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.120]   take it home with you and you own it.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:50.520]   And maybe you rent something, but now we've got software as a service.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.320]   So maybe you rent something as needed.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.640]   Maybe you rent it one time.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.200]   Maybe it's a constant.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.000]   Maybe you're buying a product.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.440]   And you're also sharing data because you're not buying the product at full price.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.040]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   And we just...
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.400]   We don't know yet.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.360]   We haven't really lived that for long enough.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.360]   No, it's true.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.360]   It is.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.360]   It is early days, dammit.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.360]   Yes.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.360]   I love it, though.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.200]   We love the uncertainty because it's fun to talk about it.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   For instance, who knew that New Jersey had a Twitter account?
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.080]   And a brilliant one it is.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.080]   Yo.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.080]   Yo.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.800]   It is a brilliant Twitter account.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.760]   For instance, somebody tweeted, "Who let New Jersey have a Twitter?"
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.920]   It's @... by the way, if you want to follow them, it's @njgov, GOV.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.440]   Who let New Jersey have a Twitter guy named Gary wondered.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.720]   Your mom replied, "The state of New Jersey."
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:50.840]   By the way, that tweet, half a million likes.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:55.080]   So they're clearly speaking the speak, the talk.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.320]   Oh, and they're verified.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.320]   They're verified.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.320]   Of course they are.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.560]   Yes.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.880]   As to whether or not there is such a thing as central Jersey, which I believe we are,
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:04.880]   I'm in it.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.880]   There's a huge fight about this.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.880]   No, no, no.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.880]   It's just doors themselves.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.080]   It's just a single central.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.520]   And so there's a constant fight on here.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:18.600]   They have a video of Bon Jovi confirming that there is a central Germany, Jersey.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:24.440]   By the way, our official state dog now is the C&I dog.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.440]   Is that really true?
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.280]   Yeah, because Morristown is the headquarters of the C&I.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.640]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.840]   We have guide dogs who are trained here in San Miguel too.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:35.840]   It's so great.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.880]   You watch these dogs, you don't have to talk to them, but the dogs are being walked all
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.880]   or being trained all the time.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.120]   They're wonderful.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.680]   So the state of New Jersey clearly is doing this right.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:50.080]   I mean, this has got to be the only state that has baby Yoda as its avatar.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.080]   The official Twitter of the Garden State, all Jersey, all the time.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.560]   You have dark mode, Jesus.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.120]   I love dark mode.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.120]   What's wrong with dark mode?
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.120]   This hurts my eyes.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.120]   The white mode.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.120]   Really bothers me.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.320]   Let New Jersey have a Twitter.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.160]   New Jersey becomes the first state.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.280]   Every female rapper ever heard from New Jersey got bars.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.080]   I don't know what this is.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.080]   There it is.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.680]   John Bon Jovi confirming the existence of Central Jersey.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.960]   Let me turn on the audio so we can hear it.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.960]   Hey, John.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.760]   Central Jersey exists.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.760]   Absolutely.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.960]   I'm proof that it exists.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.960]   We are central Jersey.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:24.960]   That's our new sign.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.640]   That's the gang sign.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.120]   That's the gang sign.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.520]   That's my gang sign for Central Jersey.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:35.000]   We are Central Jersey.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.680]   That's the C for saying.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.080]   Another random tweet from NJ Gog.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.160]   Like the next jug handle.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.160]   I don't get it.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.520]   Do you even know what that is?
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.880]   No, what's a jug handle?
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:53.280]   New Jersey had two things that were unique or special to New Jersey in traffic.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.440]   One was we had the circle, but we were smart enough to get the hell rid of it.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.200]   Boston still has those stupid things.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.520]   The other one is the jug handle.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.240]   You never take a left turn in New Jersey.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.240]   You always go round.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.240]   There's the jug handle.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   It's the jug handle.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.240]   Nice.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.240]   Oh my.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.240]   Oh, there it is.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.520]   Wait, our second jug handle is this.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.520]   What?
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.160]   Are circles rotaries?
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.160]   Circles are rotaries.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.160]   We think they're dumb.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.160]   We used to have what we learned.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.160]   Rotaries are quite effective.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.160]   Oh, they're brilliant.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.160]   No, no, no.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.160]   People get killed in rotaries.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.160]   What?
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.160]   Oh, in New Jersey they did.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.160]   You drive like to do in Jersey.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.160]   Yeah, you shouldn't have a...
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.240]   You shouldn't have to get a rotary.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   We just started putting them in.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.240]   I think they're great.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.240]   They're also less expensive to build.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.000]   You don't have to put in street lights.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Is it...
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.240]   There's a word for the left, not having a left turn.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.240]   It's like a...
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:45.000]   It says like a Massachusetts left or something left.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   What am I talking about?
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.720]   In Hudson County, New Jersey, they have a different constitution.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:54.000]   It says that people trading left have a right of way over all forms of life.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   Wow.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Okay.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   Okay.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Anyway, well done New Jersey.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.760]   They got a whole article going to New Yorker about it.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.760]   So I guess they must have done something.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.080]   A little late, but that's fine.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.080]   Oh, really?
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.080]   So I'm just catching up now.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.600]   Yeah, I put it in that thing.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:17.240]   If it's not in the New Yorker, I can't be expected to know about it.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.920]   How am I to know?
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.760]   You young people.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:28.440]   Google has just released a high res brain map of the fruit fly.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:33.360]   The most high res brain map ever.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.840]   It looks like it skittles.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.040]   It looks like the fruit fly ate the rainbow.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:44.360]   25,000 neurons, which sounds like a lot, but it ain't.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.360]   Nope.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   Nope.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:52.160]   I thought we already mapped the neurons of a rat in a jaw.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.360]   To take only the round worms.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.280]   C elegans has had its brain completely mapped.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.280]   Oh.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.080]   I wonder what Dermidro is mapping.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.560]   A little bit.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.720]   A little bit of a dog brain.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.720]   Rat brain.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:10.440]   The connectome is actually a word you should get to know.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:14.520]   Because and this is from Neil Stevenson's last novel, The Fall.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:20.120]   They talk about the whole issue of putting your brain in a machine and all of this.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:25.320]   And what they find like in the book conclude is you don't duplicate the brain.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.120]   You merely map its connectome.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.040]   That is the connections that are stored with it.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.520]   Is that a made up word?
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:34.240]   No, no, that's the word they use now.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:41.560]   And so mapping the connectome, in fact, it's called connectome connectome connectome connect
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.560]   connectome connectome connectome connectome connectome connectome connectome connectome.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.560]   Well, that's the internet.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.560]   Connectomics.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.560]   That's the internet.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.360]   We're showing you a Wikipedia page.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.320]   But in fact, even the first calls it connectome.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:51:00.240]   It uses detailed imaging techniques to map the physical math pathways of the brain.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.960]   This map is only one third of the fruit flies brain.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:09.560]   So only see elegans, which has apparently even less cognitive ability than a fruit fly.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:10.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.560]   Roundworms.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.560]   Very dumb.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.560]   Dumb.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.560]   We dissect it.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.800]   When we dissected roundworms in science, you had to be careful not to mess the not to
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.600]   hit the brain.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.560]   Drosophila hemibrine.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.720]   25,000 neurons, 4,000 distinct types.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:30.360]   Here are examples of the type grouped by functional compartment.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:33.320]   I love neurotalk.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.920]   Central complex.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:40.720]   So is, are we going to call the connectome that is replacing the whole concept of neuromorphic
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.520]   computing, which used to be such an exciting thing?
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.520]   That's cool.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:47.520]   Because you can simulate the connectome.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.920]   And it's not simulated brain.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:51.880]   It's very hard to simulate a brain because of the way that it was massively parallel
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:52.880]   nature of it.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.440]   But you could simulate the connectome.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:58.120]   And so it's conceivable that you could store a connectome.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.120]   OK.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:03.560]   This kind of gets into my whole like do not ask me why I was thinking about this.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:07.120]   But I was like, you know, we're really going in space exploration down the wrong track
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.760]   with mechanical like survivability of people in space.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:15.120]   We're going to have to do some crazy gene editing to make ourselves more adaptable to space.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.120]   You know, I really think it was Daniel Suarez.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.120]   You know, I don't know.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.560]   Daniel Suarez talks about this in his most recent book.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.840]   We had him and Delta V.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.960]   We had him on the triangulation.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:28.240]   A few months ago, he said, the whole notion of going to Mars is holding on musculoscalenized
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.960]   Mars is insanely difficult.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:38.960]   For instance, Mars is covered with dust so fine that if you inhaled it, you're dead
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.960]   instantly.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:43.280]   Did you see the scientific American article about radiation on Mars?
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.280]   No.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.120]   Another reason one wouldn't want to move there.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.120]   Yes.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.120]   It's like you would never want to live there.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.120]   You would die.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:53.640]   The prospect of making Mars habitable is almost insurmountable.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:57.440]   So this is a whole Mac, you know, Macguffin.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.680]   You know, Greta's right.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:59.680]   Let's fix this planet.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.680]   Let's we did this.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:05.360]   This is the whole plan is not going to really be viable for some time.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.120]   Can we still send some politicians up there anyway?
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.800]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.800]   You know what?
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   That's how you save the planet.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.800]   Move to them.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.080]   That's what they did in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:19.400]   They created, they said, oh, the planet's over.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.760]   Oh my God.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.520]   We've built a giant space transport.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.520]   We're going to send you to another planet.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:30.720]   But they said all the telephone sanitizers, all those useless people, useless pod, pare
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.560]   dressers, put them in it and sent them off.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.040]   And they went, oh, yeah, we're going to the new world.
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.200]   And then we went, bye bye.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.080]   And then we stayed, the rest of us stayed.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   Bye bye.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.520]   But they died of an infected telephone.
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.720]   Yes, exactly.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.920]   Oh, nice quote.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.920]   Good.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.480]   That's right.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.960]   God, Douglas Adams is missed.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   Speaking of somebody missed Terry Jones.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   Terry Jones.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.960]   Yes.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.920]   I'm going to be sad having to tell my daughter.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:03.200]   As John Cleese tweeted, now there are only four pythons left.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.400]   Graham Chapman passed away in '85 at a very young age.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.120]   And then now Terry Jones at 77.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.040]   He had been diagnosed with dementia a few years ago.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.680]   Oh no.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.640]   Passed away at the age of 77.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.440]   The great Monty Python.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.760]   And if I showed you a picture, in fact, I will, of the young Terry Jones, you'll recognize
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.280]   him immediately if you're a Python fan.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.760]   And he was the director of Life of Brian.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.520]   Thank you, Life of Brian.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.520]   Life of Brian.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.680]   He was Welsh.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.680]   There's an older picture.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.200]   Let me see if I can find it younger.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.200]   Here he is.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.200]   No one expects the Spanish.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.200]   Spanish.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.720]   That's actually another old picture because that's a recreation.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.600]   But yeah, what a wonderful funny.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.760]   That was like, that's not him.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.280]   The New York Times on their obit has a picture of him where you see him.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:51.080]   Let me go back here.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.040]   Here's the BBC.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.240]   They probably have something.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.240]   Yes.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:58.640]   And look back at the comedian's life.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.960]   There he is in.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.200]   That's Terry Jones right there.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:08.920]   So very sad to lose one of the great comic minds of our time.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:13.520]   And kids, have you turned your daughter on to Monty Python?
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.520]   Oh, yes.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.520]   Yes.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:19.240]   We were doing the Ministry of Silly Walks when she was like, oh, I love it.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:23.880]   Oh, and her favorite sketch is the hit on the head.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.640]   I can't think of the actual skit.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.160]   But any time--
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.160]   The argument clinic.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.640]   Yes, the argument clinic.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:33.240]   So any time anything hits her in the head, she goes, ow.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.640]   And then she goes, wow.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.920]   Good for-- oh, you are raising that kid right.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.000]   We have fun.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:48.600]   Watch sometime the 1985-- Paul Thoreau turned me on to this earlier today.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:53.160]   The trilogy that John Clay's delivered for Graham Chapman is marvelous.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.560]   It is very funny.
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:00.800]   Terry Jones was, of course, the very, very fat man in the meaning of life who explodes.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.680]   That's a disgusting picture.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:09.040]   Here he is on the right in life of Brian.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.040]   What a talent.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:17.920]   There he is as a gesture in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.000]   He was also-- this character was called-- the fat character was called Mr. Creuso.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.040]   Let's get that right.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.040]   And what do you have here?
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.560]   I want to one more little--
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.560]   A wafer thing.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:28.560]   It's a mint.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.560]   It's a mint.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.560]   Would you like a mitzvah?
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.560]   It's wafer thin.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.560]   Wafer thin.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:35.280]   God, you got to go back and watch all of those.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.720]   That was good TV.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.720]   I was watching.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.040]   I bought a-- God, I bought a lot of them too.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.760]   A bunch of DVDs of the Dick Cavitt show.
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.760]   You won't know who that is, Stacey.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.080]   But Mr. Jarvis will--
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.720]   I certainly do.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.040]   That was that defined erudite in our generation.
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.040]   Yes.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:56.840]   And at the end of all the shows, it says, "Mr. Cavitt's wardrobe provided by Jay Press
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.840]   of New Haven."
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:58.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:03.400]   But it's fun to watch because he interviewed everybody, of course, in the '60s and '70s.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.760]   And I was watching his interview with George Harrison.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.480]   And this is probably six-- I don't know when it was.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.840]   No, it was '72, something like that.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:12.880]   And Harrison says, "Have you seen Monty Python?
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:13.880]   It's hysterical."
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.720]   And nobody in the American heard of it yet.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:21.360]   I think George Harrison was instrumental, actually, in bringing Monty Python to a broader audience.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:25.080]   He produced-- I think-- I remember he produced some of their movies.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:25.600]   Is that right?
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.400]   Time bandits, maybe.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.040]   I don't remember.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.120]   Anyway.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:34.200]   Dick Cavitt interviewed Howard Stern, was befuddled by him.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.800]   Oh, I bet he was.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.120]   My entire career is modeled on Dick Cavitt.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:40.680]   Just so you know.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.600]   OK, have we talked about Google much at all?
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.240]   Yeah, oh, so much.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.440]   OK, no, I'm just checking.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:47.440]   I'm like, wait a second.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.440]   Wake up, Stacy.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.440]   Wake up, Stacy.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.440]   I just did the fruit fly brain.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.440]   I'm like, how are the show?
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:52.440]   I just did the fruit fly brain.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.040]   And people being pissed at them.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.040]   Oh, that was Google.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.840]   And the trillion dollars.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.800]   OK, yes, the trillion dollar.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:57:59.800]   OK, I feel better.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:03.800]   Did we mention last week that Google is killing third party cookies over the next few years?
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:04.800]   Yes, we did.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:05.800]   But we did.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.800]   There was a-- we'll stick up on the run out of all the things to mention.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:08.800]   Kind of a foul.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:09.800]   How much is this going to hurt publishers?
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:18.640]   Is this a wonderful for privacy act or is this a form of industry capture where the latter?
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.640]   Absolutely.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:23.080]   Yeah, Google wins and little guys lose.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.880]   Because now I've been screaming at my industry, screaming at them for years to no end.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:27.880]   Nobody listens to me.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.880]   That's because you're a crank.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.440]   And I'm willing to need not to go list.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:36.840]   But I was screaming that they had to develop their own first party data.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.480]   They had to build products that would enable that because you build products that were
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.560]   targeted to interests and needs.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:42.560]   That's right.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:45.240]   That you could use that across your services and then you could build commerce around that
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.240]   and so on and so forth.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.800]   And they don't do it because they still will only think in terms of a mass product.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:51.800]   Right.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:57.280]   I think the New York Times is doing an OK job with the wire cutter and some of the newsletters.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.760]   Yeah, they just announced all the other news people are thinking about the New York Times
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.800]   and they-- sorry guys, you can't.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:06.840]   More than $800 million in subscription revenue last year, right?
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.760]   No, no, no, they're in the Washington Post is doing well, but they are national publications.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.760]   Right.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.760]   They are.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:18.800]   We look at the LA Times was trying to go from 150,000 to 300,000 subs.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:24.280]   They got 50,000 but lost 35,000, then it only 15.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:28.200]   So that's where-- and the LA Times is like the next biggest paper in the country in terms
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.800]   of market.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.360]   Nobody else in the New York Times.
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.360]   Nobody.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:38.440]   So local is the victim of the internet because you have to have a scale.
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:39.440]   It shouldn't be.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.480]   You know, it was the opposite I think Leo.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.800]   I think the problem is they're still trying to get scale at a local market.
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.800]   They should have been local and targeted.
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:47.800]   Super serious.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.800]   Yeah, they should have been super serving.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:52.760]   And that was their opportunity and they missed it because they still thought they were
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.680]   going to be-- they were the monopoly in the market at scale.
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:59.240]   Case in point-- and this is a little bit inside baseball, but bear with me.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:04.280]   I work-- I do my radio show for the largest radio company in the United States.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.280]   I heart radio.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.280]   I heart media now.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.920]   They're syndicated-- syndication arm is premier.
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.520]   That's who does my radio show.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:19.640]   They have been over the last week laying off dozens of local small radio hosts and program
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.640]   directors.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.280]   The list is staggering.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.240]   These people were all laid off in the last few days.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:31.800]   They're going to go with just the Nillow National Program.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.800]   That's my guess.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.800]   It's not clear.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.280]   I heart has really not really addressed this.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.320]   This is a list from Radio Insight.com.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.120]   It's being updated continuously.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.880]   Dallas, Dayton Defu-- well, I'll give you Austin's in here and you Stacy probably know
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.880]   your local--
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.760]   How about Stacy has a listen to broadcast radio?
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.760]   That's the problem.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.160]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:01.760]   But I mean, so every market has had one, two, three, sometimes more than layoffs.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.200]   And I think what this-- your first inclination is, well, I blame my heart media.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.000]   Maybe you would, Jeff, but I would say this is the internet killing radio.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.440]   No, it's also radio kill radio.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   Radio was crap.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.960]   If you go to Europe, radio is still popular and love it because they have decent programming.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:23.240]   Part of that's because they have government subsidized media as well.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:28.200]   And it's just the day how we're stirring left, trust, I've listened to Russia.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.760]   Well, I hear not alone.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.760]   And I think that's why I listened to it.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.840]   This has been good for podcasting.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.920]   People don't-- or it used to be you'd turn on the radio in the car, you push one of those
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.800]   five buttons, you listen to that station.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.960]   Now it's on-- this is what you listen to in the car for most people.
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.000]   You know, I take it back.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.400]   I had to listen to radio for one other reason.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:50.120]   I had to listen to the absolutely billius NJ-1015 because they are the only ones who
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.120]   have traffic.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.120]   Right.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.240]   The only thing on radio is the stupidest thing ever invented.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.000]   You have millions of miles of roads.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   I know.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   And all you got to hear is--
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.560]   30 seconds is going to tell you what happens in a few of them.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.200]   It is just an awful, awful thing.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.580]   And when waves came along, it saved me from those bozos and made me really happy.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:12.820]   So yeah, it's the internet, but it's the internet writ large.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:17.040]   Well, I think the same thing is happening to small town newspapers that's happening
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.480]   to small town radio stations.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.840]   And the problem is we lose who's going to cover the city councils?
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:29.520]   Who's going to give you the local story?
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.520]   There is something amazing going on in every small community and small town radio and small
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.440]   town newspapers covered it.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.760]   But what is the problem, Jeff?
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.760]   How do you invent journalism?
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.760]   Can podcast saver--
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.360]   Can podcasts save-- should podcasters go out and should there be a peddleoom of podcast?
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.600]   Yeah, but it's a tough business.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.600]   Well, you have to--
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.600]   I figured--
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.600]   Because in the same time--
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.880]   All the retailers who bought ads on the local radio stations--
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.880]   They're dying.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.520]   Oh, they're dying, too.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.960]   They're dying, number one and number two.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:05.120]   If they're not dying, they can advertise on TripAdvisor and Google and so on and get
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.160]   a better deal.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.840]   And so the business-- I heard from a local blogger.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.080]   I think he's a really good guy.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.000]   He's a little cranky.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.240]   But that's what makes him survive.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.160]   And I thought, OK, he's an example I've been giving for some time of somebody who's doing
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.240]   a good job or not going to say what he is.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.000]   We still have peddleoom a patch.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.160]   He's not doing that well.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.160]   His patch--
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160]   His patch--
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160]   His patch--
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.160]   His patch--
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.640]   It seems there should be a model, but I don't know what the model is.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.640]   It may be--
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.640]   So maybe there is no revenue in that hyperlocal--
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.040]   You always use that word hyperlocal.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.040]   I loved hyperlocal.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.520]   I wrote a whole thing.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.000]   I was completely wrong about it thinking that hyperlocal blogs were going to save us
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   as a building block.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.400]   I was utterly, completely wrong.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.200]   Because the work is too hard.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:54.280]   And programmatic came in and took away a lot of that advertising.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:04:00.720]   And Emma's jam can sell on programmatic and Google better than they can in a local publication.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.680]   Local retail is dying rapidly.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.360]   And there wasn't the market for it.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:13.000]   So we have to rethink around community-based things and service-based things and knowledge
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   people.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:21.120]   So it hits me because in 1976 in college, I fell in love with radio.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.840]   And all I ever wanted to do was radio.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.400]   I dropped out of school to do radio.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:32.320]   And if not for the grace of podcasting, there go I, a thousand local small town radio hosts.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.920]   I probably would have been one of them out of work.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:39.760]   And it's not like you can go to the other station across the street.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.720]   Those jobs are disappearing.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.360]   I think the people who made fun of me for being internet back in newspapers.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.640]   And I became the assistant manager editor of the Duluth Daily Disgrace in Jarvis here.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.680]   Where are you working on people magazine use line?
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.720]   And now they're all unemployed.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.840]   And I don't say that with any glee, but they all kind of said, "Oh, yeah."
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.800]   So I mean, I don't want to portion blame.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.720]   It might just be, this is economics.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:12.640]   Maybe the buggy whip makers of the 21st century.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.440]   So I just was writing the part, this part of it.
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:24.480]   So when Gutenberg, oh, oh, when, so Gutenberg and Foust and Shiffer were the two first printers
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.440]   of the printing shops in the world.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.720]   Together they did the Bible and they split up and did separate shops.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:38.480]   And then there was a war in their city of mines and they all got banished for about two years.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.320]   And that's what spread printing around the world.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.400]   Because the printers, their people who worked in their print shops said, "Oh, no work here."
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.760]   So they took their matrices and their knowledge and they went elsewhere.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.760]   Right?
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.760]   And they grew up.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.960]   But at the same time, the new Archbishop of Mines said, "I want to have printing because
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.880]   I see how powerful this is."
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.200]   Before the war came, there were pamphlets.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:01.720]   One of the first things printed on these presses were news pamphlets, polemics from both sides
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.600]   in the war.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.520]   And so propaganda was one of the first things printed ever.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.720]   And so one of the winners said, "I want that discontinuous."
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.640]   He got a monastery to get his own presses and print stuff, right?
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.760]   Because I'm going to support this.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.160]   And it didn't work as a business.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.640]   It just didn't work.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.640]   Right?
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.600]   So government support didn't work.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.400]   We've tried to find these models through time.
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.600]   It took a long time.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:30.840]   In 1805, the first weekly newspaper, the first regular newspaper I've ever published in Alsace,
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.320]   he wanted a monopoly, didn't get it.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.320]   He thought it'd be a great business.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.360]   Turned out to be a crappy business.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.120]   And it takes time to reinvent these models and figure it out.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.320]   It's going to take a long time to rebuild from the ashes.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.960]   Sorry, end of Gutenberg's field.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.960]   You can put your glasses down now.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.920]   And then of course later, Jefferson's starship did that great song City of Mines all about
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.840]   this story.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.720]   That's a reference, yeah.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.040]   Never forget it.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.600]   What about this Jeff Bezos story?
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.600]   What do you think about this?
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:12.360]   Jeff Bezos today tweeting a picture of him at the memorial for Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:19.280]   Post journalist who was, I think, killed by Saudis in the Turkish embassy.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:26.320]   And then of course the latest, and I don't, I mean it's wild, is that apparently Bezos,
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:31.040]   we were wondering where, remember the national inquirer tried to blackmail Bezos, say we have
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:36.880]   pictures of you and we'll publish them unless you lay off the president or say, I can't
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:41.880]   remember what the quid pro quo was, not that that ever happens.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:47.080]   But Bezos, of course, then went to medium and said, well, okay, fine, let's get on with
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.080]   it.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.920]   And then the question was where do those pictures and the texts about him and Lauren Sanchez
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.920]   has grown from somebody presumed that his phone got stolen for a while.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.920]   And then for a while everybody seemed to think it was Lauren Sanchez's estranged brother.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.560]   Brother, right.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.000]   This is the news story and it's a shocker.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:12.560]   Apparently Bezos was in a WhatsApp conversation with MBS Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:16.640]   And at some point in the conversation bin Salman sent him a file which hacked his phone within
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.640]   minutes.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.520]   All of the data on his phone is exfiltrated, including I presume those pictures.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.520]   Yes.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:30.040]   So didn't Bezos, didn't his security officer actually talk about Saudi being the source
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:34.240]   of the hack around that time and everyone made fun of him.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.240]   You're right.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:41.760]   And what's the thing I took away from all of this, including the tweeting of the picture,
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:48.520]   Jeff has turned it to a master, like social media user, just excellent or his team is
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.000]   using this very well.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.760]   He's almost as good as New Jersey.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:56.920]   Well that tweet and let me go back to the from the Axios story of this tweet.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.760]   It has just one word hashtag Jamal.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.160]   It is very somber.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.960]   It's a beautiful tweet and talk about sub tweeting.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.880]   That's all you have to do, right?
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880]   Yep.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.880]   One word.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.880]   That's all.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:17.240]   And wow, the UN is now calling for an investigation.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.040]   That gives it lends it some credence.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:25.520]   And MBS met with a lot of people.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520]   He met with Bush.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.760]   He met with Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.200]   He met with lots of people.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.240]   Well he's invested in lots of money.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.000]   The Saudi sovereign fund is primary.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.760]   It's one of the primary venture capitalists in Silicon Valley.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:43.200]   Yeah, so I imagine everybody's looking at their WhatsApp chats and replacing their
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.200]   phone.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.720]   Well, and it's like everybody's also pretending they don't know MBS.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:51.120]   And it's like it's like Jeffrey Epstein all of a sudden.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.120]   I don't know.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.120]   Who's that?
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.120]   Never heard of him.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.120]   Never hung out with that dude.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.120]   Never hung out with that dude.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.120]   What plane?
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:04.440]   Well, it's just, I mean I just, I just want everybody to know I did not take any money
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.600]   from Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.600]   Okay.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.840]   I take it if they send it to me.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:16.160]   Well, yeah, I have somebody I know in a business who lots of not that long ago took money from
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.160]   Saudi sovereign fund.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.520]   I think that's okay.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:23.320]   Five years ago, I think if you did it today, it would be like, come on guy.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.280]   And you can't, but you can't send that money back.
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.280]   You spent it.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.280]   Right.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.280]   Right.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:34.520]   The UN report details a forensic investigation into longstanding allegations by Bezos that
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:39.000]   he was a victim of a cyber attack by the Saudi regime as part of a complex series of
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.920]   conflicts among Bezos, the Saudis, President Trump and the national enquirer.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.640]   It is one of those.
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:49.280]   It is, it is what has become a politics in Washington under Trump.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.640]   It's a transaction.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:52.840]   You scratch my back.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.840]   I'll scratch yours.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.880]   And by the way, MBS doesn't need the money.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.320]   But he was, he was doing favors.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.920]   So one lesson here is never give your actual phone number to somebody who has a government
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.560]   intelligence agency behind them.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.080]   Number two, people were talking about the encryption of WhatsApp that's utterly irrelevant
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.080]   here, right?
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.680]   He said an MP4 file, supposedly.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.600]   And it didn't matter how it got sent.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.280]   Once you open it, your, your, what's app is encrypted in transit, but it's not encrypted
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.280]   in your phone.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.000]   So if your phone is hacked, it's all there.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.080]   And incidentally, if you back up WhatsApp with on an iPhone with iCloud, it's also in
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.080]   the cloud.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.280]   We should really emphasize, I keep saying it, but I just want everybody to know.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:37.320]   iCloud is not encrypted.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.960]   It's, Apple has the keys to it.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:44.760]   And, and, and, and in this Pensacola case, in the San Bernardino case, in the San Bernardino
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.680]   case, the FBI screwed it up.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.480]   But in the Pensacola case, Apple sent a lot of iCloud data to the FBI.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:58.240]   The F, the, you know, it, we talked about this on Tuesday with, with Renee Richie, the
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.320]   impression most people have is that your iPhone is encrypted and your data on the cloud
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.320]   is encrypted.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.080]   Your iPhone is encrypted.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:09.640]   But if you back up your iPhone to the cloud, which everybody does, that's not encrypted.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.440]   But not the case with Android, yes.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.200]   I'm sure you'll want that.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.560]   If we back it up to Google.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.560]   Well, okay.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.560]   Yes.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.280]   Let's talk about that story because I'm, it's a little unclear.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.280]   I would not.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.480]   I want to hear you explain it to me.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.480]   Android.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:33.000]   So, so Google offers end-to-end encryption for Android backups.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   Apple.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.200]   So there was a story that Apple wanted to do end-to-end encryption on its backups.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.760]   And the FBI said, please don't.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.600]   There's some lack of credibility, by the way, in that story.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:54.040]   It's probable that the six sources that Reuters quoted in this story, at least five of the
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.480]   six were FBI employees.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.720]   One of them was a former Apple employee.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.680]   Renee Richie said, I remember those times.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:03.160]   Go to John Gruber.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.040]   Apple made the decision, not because at the behest of the FBI, but just because if you
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.640]   did offer encrypted backup and people lost their password, you wouldn't be able to help
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.000]   them.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.760]   And so while Google has decided, okay, well, we just tell people, hey, you lose your, you
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.320]   lose your key, you lose your password, you're out of luck.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.880]   Apple is unwilling to do that.
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:27.920]   So apparently Google does do that.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.680]   Apple did not switch.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:39.280]   I still would not assume, I would not assume that anything that you're exfiltrating or
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:46.600]   backing up to the cloud is private, if just in case you want to know.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.600]   Apple's rules are very arcane.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:54.280]   And Apple really kind of, I think, fosters a misimpression that they encrypt everything.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:14:01.080]   Going to Android Central, back in 2018, Google quietly enabled end-to-end encryption for
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:04.960]   Android backups.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:09.200]   With a Titan security chip housed in Google's data center, ensuring data integrity, this
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.880]   is starting with Android Pie.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:19.720]   I'm not sure what you have to do to make sure your PIN or passcode is a description key for
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:25.440]   the Titan module, without it you won't be able to access your data.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.720]   But it only works for, this is important.
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:32.440]   And this is the problem I have with Apple too.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.000]   It's not immediately care what's encrypted and what's not.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.200]   The backup, Google backup is only for application backups, so your WhatsApp would be secure,
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:46.720]   but not anything you store on Google Drive, that as always is unencrypted, is available
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.160]   to law enforcement.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.880]   If you want to secure your data in your drive, you need to encrypt it before you send it
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.040]   up to Google Drive.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040]   So that's why it's confusing, right?
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.240]   And Apple does offer, by the way, fully encrypted backups.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.240]   You just have to do it to hardware.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:09.800]   You have to connect your iPhone via cable to a Mac or a PC with iTunes and say, "I
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.200]   want an encrypted backup, provide a password."
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.200]   That is fully encrypted.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.240]   Apple doesn't have access to that.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:20.720]   But if you use iCloud to backup WhatsApp, and we know this because Paul Manafort got
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:25.720]   bit by it, Apple has unencrypted versions of the WhatsApp messages.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:29.000]   So WhatsApp is not as secure as one might imagine.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.600]   You signal and turn off iCloud backup.
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.360]   I was going to say, it's no big enough.
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:38.400]   And especially if you're talking to MBS.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.400]   Do not.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.520]   Well, I would throw in a Russian oligarch.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.720]   There are lots of people.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.960]   Chinese, Turkish, Hungarian.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.320]   Perhaps US, depending on your political orientation.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.320]   Good.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.320]   I'm going to WhatsApp right now with President Trump.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.240]   Should I get out of it?
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.640]   I'm in one with Don Jr.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:05.120]   The funny thing is, WhatsApp with anybody in the way, there is no WhatsApp.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.120]   There's no WhatsApp.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:11.480]   They don't care.
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.480]   Maybe they shouldn't.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.040]   Maybe it doesn't matter.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.040]   Maybe they're untouchable.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:22.160]   Y'all are depressing the heck out of you.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.320]   Did you stay up until like one in the morning last night?
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   No.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.360]   It was a little boring.
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.360]   I cried.
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:32.040]   A little boring.
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.760]   Schiff is very good at presenting.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.960]   His talk today was very well done.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:44.000]   But what can engage you for 12 hours?
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.040]   I've watched billions for 12 hours.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.040]   Yeah, right.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:55.200]   I want to say that's kind of intentional because I don't think there are a lot of people who
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.160]   would prefer that you do not watch.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:03.040]   I don't think, I mean, I'll be honest, I don't think that many people are watching.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.200]   But the Senate controls where the cameras are, how they're pointed.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.360]   I think they're intentionally pointing them and if they're making this dull.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.920]   You know, I know a little bit about this.
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.280]   You want to get some shots at the chamber of center sleeping.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.040]   They're all walking around sleeping.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.520]   You don't just lock the one camera down on the person reading and just leave it there.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:27.360]   I mean, this isn't C-SPAN for crying out loud.
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:31.880]   Oh, it is.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:39.760]   Supreme Court has declined to hear a Facebook face recognition case.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.920]   Is this the Illinois one?
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:43.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.920]   Are the Indiana one?
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:45.920]   Is it Illinois?
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.520]   It's Facebook versus Patel.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:52.120]   The hinges on the question over whether Facebook violated Illinois law when it implemented
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:55.280]   a photo tagging feature that recognized users faces.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:00.800]   I'm reading from the Hill and suggested their names without getting adequate consent from
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.320]   the user.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:11.480]   So this high court rejected Facebook's bid to review the case.
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:16.720]   So Facebook will now be facing a multi-billion dollar class action lawsuit in Illinois.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:23.840]   In other words, the Supreme Court by declining to review it, let it go forward.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.360]   So that's bad for Facebook, I guess.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.360]   Right.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.360]   They'll either have to settle or...
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:30.360]   Right.
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.360]   It's a state case.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.600]   It's an attorney general, right?
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.600]   Right.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.120]   The Ninth Circuit Court ruled last year that Facebook had to face the lawsuit.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:45.000]   Facebook appealed and the Supreme Court said, "No, we're not going to overturn that."
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.840]   But this is a state law, I mean, the same.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.080]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:55.560]   I'm not seeing what reasons the Supreme Court passed on this.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:59.160]   Facebook said the class action case should not be allowed to proceed because the group
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.560]   of users have not proven the alleged privacy violation resulted in real-world harm.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.080]   There's a doctrine, there has to be some harm or you can't sue.
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:10.600]   You can't sue just because you don't like it, there has to be some harm.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.680]   The Supreme Court rejected that argument.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.280]   Well, now harm is going to...
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.080]   It's like the UK harm is reported.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:23.720]   It's going to become feelings, nothing more than feelings.
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:27.240]   Well, it is a privacy intrusion.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:30.320]   I don't know.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.960]   This is why I just prefer to stay off Facebook.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:33.960]   I understand.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.960]   I know that's podcast your privilege.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:36.960]   I understand.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.720]   We just need to have cards that the government can play.
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.720]   Yours says...
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:47.600]   Like, what Facebook mind says, "moral panic," Stacy says, "Oh, Jeff."
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.600]   And then punches.
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.600]   Wait, don't I get something...
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.600]   Yeah, what do you want?
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.600]   You're decent like other than "Oh, Jeff."
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:53.600]   Don't get like less dirty.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.480]   No, you have your others with your star.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.400]   What do you want to say?
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.400]   What about this time?
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:00.400]   You read it on...
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.400]   This is a story from the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:05.840]   Let me see if I can summarize this case.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:15.200]   The FBI in August of 2018 raided Omar Amin Sacramento apartment alleging that he was,
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:23.640]   in fact, an ISIL member and had hid his ties to the group when he fled Iraq and came to
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.880]   America.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.240]   They wanted to deport him.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:34.680]   In fact, he could now become the first person in US history ever to be extradited to Iraq.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:43.720]   However, his attorneys say that there is evidence in his social media that he was 600
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:47.000]   miles away from the murder that he's accused of in Iraq.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.120]   Additionally, an Islamic State Twitter account that the company suspended, as well as a suspended
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:56.320]   Facebook account, could be instrumental in proving his innocence.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:01.480]   Neither Facebook nor Twitter will cooperate.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:06.040]   The San Francisco Superior Court Judge last year issued a scathing critique of those company's
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:12.600]   policies finding Twitter and Facebook in "inexcusable contempt" for refusing his order to release evidence
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.680]   in a murder case.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:18.160]   Judge Charles Crompton wrote Facebook and Twitter appear to be misusing their immense
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.400]   resources to manipulate the judicial system in a manner that deprives two indigent young
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:27.440]   men facing life sentences of their constitutional right to defend themselves a trial.
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.360]   But Facebook and Twitter have made it clear they're unwilling to alter their behavior
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:35.960]   regardless of the "get the red ready for this" harm to others or the rulings of this
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.160]   court.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.160]   Interesting, huh?
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.800]   What is their logic behind not?
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.320]   Is it that they don't have the means to do it?
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.960]   They're citing these stores to get ready for this.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:52.240]   The Stored Communications Act, the 30-year-old privacy law that didn't even know about digital.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.000]   Free to indicate, right, sorry, yes.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.240]   To withhold information.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:02.560]   Apparently, this is not at all unusual.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:05.880]   They frequently do this.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:10.440]   San Francisco Chronicle writes that the social networks routinely use their vast legal resources
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:14.320]   to fight defense subpoenas, which by the way, we encourage them to do, right?
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.320]   Right, yes, right.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.320]   This is the default because you don't want to...
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.520]   Yeah, I'm just curious what the rationale is.
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:26.320]   And yeah, this guy, I mean, if somebody's wrongfully accused of crime and you have information
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:32.320]   that exonerates them, it seems ethically problematic that you would really...
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.320]   Interesting, President.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:39.520]   Ben and Agnes, who I think is brilliant, brilliant analyst, talks this week about how
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:43.600]   people cheered the LinkedIn decision that says, "You can scrape, you can scrape."
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:47.160]   Well, now it means you can also scrape everybody's photos, which led to the New York Times story
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.160]   now.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.160]   Right.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.160]   You know, there's unintended consequences.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.160]   It's so complicated.
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:52.160]   It's so complicated.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.240]   It's wonderful on one end, and then on the other end, we say, "Oh."
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.240]   So complicated.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.040]   I think, as it makes you say, "Oh."
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:00.040]   By the way, I really love this, and I recommend everybody read it.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.040]   That could be your sound.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.800]   We're a big fan of Bruce Schnier.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:07.280]   He is one of the premier security researchers in the country, a fellow at Harvard Kennedy
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.280]   School.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:13.080]   He said, "You're missing the point by merely banning face recognition.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:19.280]   Face recognition is a small part of these overall technological capabilities to identify
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.560]   you from afar."
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:25.040]   He said, "People can be identified by their heartbeat, by their gate.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.240]   Cameras are so googled they can read fingerprints and iris patterns from meters away.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:34.320]   We can be identified because our smartphones broadcast MAC addresses.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.520]   Other things identify us as well.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:39.080]   Our phone numbers, our credit card numbers, the license plates on our cars.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:44.840]   Schnier uses multiple identification technologies to support its surveillance state."
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:48.640]   He says, "There's an entire industry of data brokers who make living, analyzing and augmenting
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:52.800]   data about who we are using surveillance data collected by all sorts of companies then sold
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.000]   without our knowledge or consent."
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.920]   He's face recognition.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.520]   That's just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:05.000]   Today, facial recognition technology receiving the brunt of the tech backlash, focusing on
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.760]   them misses the point, Bruce Schnier writes.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.920]   We need to have a serious conversation about all the technologies of identification, correlation
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:12.920]   and discrimination.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.080]   That's what you want to talk about.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.080]   I'm sure Stacey.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:19.160]   And decide how much we as a society want to be spied on by governments and corporations
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.880]   and what sorts of influence we have on them to have over our lives.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:23.880]   Go ahead, Stacey.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:29.880]   No, and I was going to say, in some ways I get frustrated when people ignore this, it's
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:30.880]   a bigger problem.
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.440]   I'm like, "Yes, I get it and I do it too."
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.680]   But it's still a problem.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:41.120]   It's also people tend to look at what's the populace as we are, the mainstream world.
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.080]   We look at what's bothering us now and what we understand and what we know is widely deployed.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:52.480]   I would argue, get recognition is actually used apparently by the CIA.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:58.240]   But the laser understanding is still a DARPA research project, so I'm less worried about
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.240]   that.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:08.040]   But the discrimination issue is a real problem in understanding how we apply these technologies
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.360]   is really important.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:14.240]   Someone told me, and I think this is really accurate, when you have the ability of almost
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.920]   omniscience, the laws you choose to enforce and who you choose to enforce them against
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.560]   become incredibly important.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:27.520]   And that's where we need to be dedicating a lot of our conversations and resources.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:36.080]   Because right now, if I got robbed or mugged in the street, they might use all of the
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.840]   available technologies to find my assailant.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.320]   And you'd be happy.
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:41.320]   And I'd be happy about it.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.480]   I would.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:50.720]   If an African-American woman who is poor or a prostitute gets assaulted in the streets,
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.440]   they probably wouldn't use their resources at all, even though they have them.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:26:00.560]   And that becomes, in a lot of ways, it's not justice.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:06.280]   It is, you know, the disparity between who technology works for and doesn't is still
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:10.880]   something we have never addressed as a society.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.800]   I go back to, sorry about this, minds in 1462.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.720]   Oh my goodness.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.560]   And the Archbishop's War.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.400]   And the pamphlets for the two sides came off the same press.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:29.280]   So the same argument where presumably Fust and Shiffa were arguing that their technology
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:33.720]   was neutral.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:40.120]   But it also created a fight that might have existed.
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:41.120]   Maybe it led to war.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.480]   Maybe it delayed the war.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.680]   There's no telling what happens without these things.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.680]   Speculating.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:55.360]   I'm going to do one more story that I want to take a break and then we have a big change
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:56.360]   log.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.960]   So I want to make sure we have time for that.
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.000]   And then we'll wrap things up.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:07.200]   The Intercept last year in Brazil published articles based on a leak, a cell phone messages
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.560]   that raised questions about the integrity and the motives of key members of Brazil's
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:19.240]   justice system in particular, an anti-corruption organization.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.680]   Glenn Greenwald has now, who writes for the Intercept and wrote these stories, has now
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:33.880]   been arrested and accused of being part of a criminal organization and cyber crimes.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.200]   I have mixed feelings about Glenn Greenwald, but this sounds very much.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:48.520]   Greenwald, who is, of course, an ardent opponent of Brazil's president, the authoritarian Bolsonaro,
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:56.200]   is now in facing some serious jeopardy because of his work as a journalist.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.040]   What do you think, Jeff?
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:06.400]   Yeah, I share with you, I think that Snowden was also a green-walled story.
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.680]   And Snowden came out and said, "Beware here."
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:09.680]   And I agree.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:15.640]   One thing we haven't grappled with in our field is what if somebody did steal the data,
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:20.400]   not Glenn Greenwald, but somebody else, what is the issue of using it?
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:24.440]   And what journalists like Greenwald say is, "It doesn't matter where the information
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:25.440]   came from.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:28.240]   The public has to write, 'No, the information once it's there and once we know it, we have
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.200]   an obligation to share it.'"
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:35.600]   And that's been his pretty dogmatic view.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:44.360]   And I think I have to, by default, presume, quite a green-walled side on this.
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:50.320]   Well, partly because he's a journalist and the environment he's working in.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.320]   Yes, exactly.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:53.080]   He hasn't been detained.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:57.480]   He says, "I will continue to publish and cast the case against him as a test of Brazil's
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:58.480]   democracy.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:02.120]   We will not be intimidated," Greenwald said, "by these tyrannical attempts to silence
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:10.040]   journalists, prosecutors say they intercepted messages between Greenwald and the hackers
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.160]   saying the journalists played a clear role in facilitating the commission of a crime."
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:24.040]   Incidentally, that's exactly what U.S. prosecutors are saying about...
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:26.040]   That's...
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.040]   We helix.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:32.280]   Julius Salange.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:35.000]   Is he in prison in the U.S. or is he just a warrant?
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.200]   No, he's still awaiting extradition.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.200]   Extrajudicial.
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:40.200]   He's in the U.S. still?
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:44.640]   No, no, he's in the U.S. still, but they're trying to extradite him.
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:50.120]   And that's the accusation is not that he accepted these documents and published them,
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.120]   but that he encouraged...
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.120]   Did he encourage...
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.120]   ...helsing Manning to do it.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.120]   ...helsing Manning to do it.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.120]   Yes.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:30:01.880]   And similar to these intercepted messages, there's chat conversation.
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.640]   Very troubling.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:14.880]   At the same time, I think that a journalist should not encourage criminal activities.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:15.880]   I don't know.
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:17.360]   Jeff, you're the professor of journalism.
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.600]   What would you tell your students?
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:22.480]   Not to encourage or take part in a criminal activity.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.480]   Yes.
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:25.480]   That's a law.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:30.160]   But wait a minute, though, Daniel Ellsberg broke the law when he sent the Pentagon papers.
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.840]   Daniel Ellsberg wasn't the journalist.
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:36.200]   Daniel Ellsberg was the whistleblower who then came to the journalist.
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.200]   So Daniel Ellsberg was the criminal...
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:42.120]   Journalist knowing that it was stolen still said this is a public interest.
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:44.400]   Now that you have it, yes, we're going to publish it.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.520]   That's been the way of journalism since then.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.520]   So you're not...
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:51.160]   So it's a fine line, but you're not allowed to say...
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.160]   Yes, go ahead.
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:59.200]   Go go to steal those Pentagon papers, Xeroxim and Santa to us, but you can accept them if
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:03.640]   Ellsberg on his own does that and sends them to you in an unmarked package and you open
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.480]   it up and say, "Oh my God."
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:08.800]   Or even if he comes into your office and says, "I just stole this and you can have it."
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:09.800]   Even then.
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:10.800]   Yes.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:11.800]   I mean, that's so...
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:12.800]   So in our terms...
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:13.800]   But if your buying stolen iPhones...
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.040]   Well, that's the question.
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.040]   So Brian Lamb gives Moto.
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:23.320]   iPhone is left on a bar, somebody finds it, calls them up and says, "Hey, I got a...
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.400]   It looks like this is the new iPhone.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.440]   You want to buy it?
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.440]   That's breaking the law."
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:31.600]   It depends in that case.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:32.760]   Did Lamb know...
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:34.800]   He didn't think it was stolen.
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:35.800]   It wasn't stolen.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:36.800]   He thought it was found.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:37.800]   It wasn't stolen.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:38.800]   It was unauthorized, but it wasn't stolen.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:39.800]   Yeah, so that's not breaking the law.
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:41.120]   That's not breaking the law, or is it?
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.600]   I don't think it was this much breaking the law.
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.400]   That was what Apple said their own beliefs after literally in the wrong.
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:48.240]   You could argue that paying for it...
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:51.640]   I mean, is that wrong of the journalist?
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:52.640]   I mean, his story...
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.320]   In the US, at least, we don't pay for content.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:55.480]   You wouldn't do that.
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.240]   No, I wouldn't, but...
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.240]   No.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.240]   Nor would I.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.240]   He's like, "I honestly...
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240]   I honestly...
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.240]   Soto's."
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.120]   I honestly...
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:08.600]   From time to time, I'm offered leaked photos of phones and things.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.640]   I honestly do not accept those.
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:11.640]   I say, "Don't send me that.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.320]   I don't want to know about it."
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.320]   I'm not in any race to get...
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.320]   You don't traffic in scoops.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:19.240]   Yeah, I'm not in a race to get scoops.
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:22.520]   I don't think anybody should be.
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:23.920]   Because that's where bad stuff can happen.
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.640]   I think scoops.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:26.880]   True scoops.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.600]   Not just like I'm really saying...
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:34.280]   I will found out about a product two days before, but a true scoop is worth it.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:39.000]   If you can find out something that someone doesn't want you to know, that is, again,
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.040]   in the public interest, not just period.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.040]   Period.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.040]   I never say that word.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.520]   I think that's important.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:48.440]   You should be focused on bringing those to your readers.
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:54.080]   Yeah, I mean, if you get papers that say Vietnam was a farce and...
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:58.360]   Well, even something as simple as, "Hey, I'm talking to developers off the record,"
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:04.920]   and they're saying to me, "Apple is telling us we can't work with this company anymore."
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.360]   That's of interest to anybody who's working in that community.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:11.240]   So those are scoops.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:18.800]   But part of the reason I don't want the leaked photos or leaks of any kind, and I can't remember
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:24.160]   if it was Evan Blass, one of the guys who routinely publishes these, kind of sounded
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.640]   like he was having a mini-crisis of conscious on Twitter.
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:30.280]   He said, "You know, I just found out from a guy who leaked me some phones that he was
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.160]   fired as a result.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.920]   He's unemployed.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:36.280]   His family is destitute.
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.800]   I feel a little guilty."
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:44.320]   I don't know if it's Evan Blass or who, but anyway, he continued doing what he was doing.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:47.160]   I don't want to be responsible for that, but maybe that's...
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:48.160]   No, that's their fault.
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:54.160]   I mean, do I feel a bit of sadness when someone says something they absolutely should not
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.280]   have said to me that I'm going to report?
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.280]   I do.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.280]   It's also...
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.280]   It's also...
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.280]   Stacey's right.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.280]   The test is public interest.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.280]   Right.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.280]   The test is public interest.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.280]   Is seeing a phone two days early, public interest?
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.280]   No.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.280]   Yes, that's right.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.280]   No.
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:10.200]   However, if you find out something scandalous...
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:15.640]   I just read today there's a story, the Grammys organization.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:16.640]   Oh my God.
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:17.640]   That is such a cluster.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.640]   It's...
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:21.200]   Well, tell me, tell me, dude.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.200]   Ever.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.280]   What happened?
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:29.200]   The head of it was put on administrative leave with allegations of some kind of improper
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.160]   conduct to an employee.
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:36.400]   She before this had said HR, a scathing memo saying there's huge problems here, sexism
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:37.400]   and stuff.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:41.840]   And I was being personally harassed by a board member, she said.
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.600]   And voting irregularities.
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.720]   Yeah, all kinds of stuff.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.040]   This wasn't just this.
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:54.320]   And then to me, I will say, it looks like the Grammy, they went by the same old school
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:58.440]   playbook of shutting down a woman and by saying she was a bitchy boss to a particular
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.440]   employee.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:05.160]   And when her complaint looks pretty strong.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.160]   I mean...
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.160]   It's really...
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.160]   But it is a...
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.160]   I didn't think...
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:14.000]   I think it's kind of a problem too, because aren't the Grammys this weekend?
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.800]   Yes, it's right before him.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.800]   Yes.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:17.800]   Whoops.
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:19.200]   So it's an example of something that...
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.000]   Are there Grammys public interest?
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.280]   On one hand, no, they're just the Grammys are a stupid award.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:30.040]   On the other hand, they say a lot about the culture and they indicate misogyny and racism.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.040]   Well, there was no law-breaking here.
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:35.920]   That's just her EEOC complaint, which is public.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.920]   So this is not related to this law.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.920]   Right.
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:43.520]   Board members, including those who represent or have relationships with nominated artists,
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.880]   sit on the secret nominating committees.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:49.640]   Indeed, it is not unusual for us to have relationships with board members who ranked
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:54.400]   at the bottom of the initial 20 artists list to end up receiving nominations.
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.840]   That's the irregularities you were talking about.
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:57.840]   You're right.
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:00.680]   Who cares who wins a Grammy, except, well, I guess the record companies do.
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:06.680]   But if you go on TV and say, here in a secret ballot, our members all agreed, this is the
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:13.320]   person who should win and it's not the case, then I think if there's irregularities, that's
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:14.320]   in the public interest.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.320]   And you're right.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.080]   Nobody had to break a law to exfiltrate that information.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:20.080]   No.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.080]   Okay.
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:26.080]   I think you've given me a good moral framework for my future work as a pretend journalist
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.240]   on this show.
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:31.160]   You can't go with the don't be a dick kind of perspective.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.720]   No, you can't.
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:38.520]   Because sometimes you need to, but you can be don't be evil if evil considers looking
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:45.360]   out for, you know, you could argue the mores of your audience or you could argue general
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.360]   moral ethics.
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.280]   I just don't want to be a dick.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.640]   I'll give you another example that I use all the time with my, with our social journalism
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:54.880]   students because we push the line of advocacy and social journalism.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:58.720]   You know, you, you observe and listen to a community, you understand this community
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.200]   and you empathize with this community, you reflect the community, then how far does that
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.200]   go?
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.800]   So, so I think I can say his name was a public event.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:10.240]   So Zach Seward, who's now the CEO of courts, who's a wonderful journalist when he was
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.560]   the Wall Street Journal, he was doing a story about a Ponzi scheme.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:20.620]   And he realized at some point in doing the story that as soon as he wrote in the Wall
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:23.640]   Street Journal, this was a Ponzi scheme, all the people he'd been talking to were going
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.640]   to lose all their money.
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:25.640]   Right.
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.640]   Right.
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:31.760]   So I come with students to say, if you, if you think you serve just that community,
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:32.760]   then what do you do?
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.160]   You, you don't tell the world.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.160]   Right.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.840]   But you serve a higher goal.
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:39.000]   You serve a higher truth.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.520]   You serve the next person.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:42.840]   You serve a greater goal.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:43.920]   And so you do reveal.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:49.240]   And yes, people got hurt along the way and they maybe helped you hurt themselves.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.000]   But you had a North Star.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.600]   But it's not easy.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.000]   And sometimes it's horrifying.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.480]   And that's why it's nice to have editors and people in your newsroom that you don't
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.480]   think so.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.480]   Yeah, let them blame them.
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:07.480]   I don't know what to do, boss.
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:08.480]   I hate it.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.480]   That's why I love blogging.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.480]   I love it.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:16.760]   Did you ever had to do the like newspaper call the family of the, of the flight attendant
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:18.520]   after the plane crash kind of thing?
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:19.520]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.760]   I've always been a business business.
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:22.760]   I had to do that.
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:27.960]   Oh, I do do an internship on the cop shop beat at like two in the morning, but that was
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:30.880]   just listening to the police radio and writing up blurbs for the most part.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.920]   Hey, there's one other smart home story.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:35.720]   I'll go and then I'll, and then, and then honest, we're going to take a break and come
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.600]   back with the change log.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.600]   Charter is shutting down.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.600]   Oh, that's what we talked about.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.600]   Oh, you already mentioned this?
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.200]   I mentioned that in the breaking section.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.760]   But it was a side.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:54.160]   Mars actually has an excellent article and they, it is theoretically possible on some
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.600]   of the equipment that you will be able to use a Zigbee or Z wave capable hub to work
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:05.360]   with things like your thermostat and maybe your lights, a few other things like that.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:11.040]   So there's people who bought hundreds and hundreds of dollars of home security stuff
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.640]   from spectrum.
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:20.960]   And they've been now, you know, I guess charter inherited it and, and they've decided they're
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:22.800]   going to shut it down.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:34.760]   And according to charter, they, maybe you can repair some of repair RE dash P I R pair
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:40.840]   once again, some of these to another hub, but, but charter saying most of these things
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.520]   are just they're not going to work anymore.
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:49.120]   And it's very much like the Sonos situation.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:55.040]   So yeah, excellent R's article, highly recommended.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:57.280]   And this is, can I mention a related for this?
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:39:59.280]   Bad cable companies.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:03.720]   So frontier is evidently headed toward bankruptcy.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.720]   Oh, imminently.
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.400]   How can you go bankrupt when you're a monopoly ISP and cable company?
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.520]   I really honestly don't understand that.
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.920]   They debt in one word debt debt.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:15.920]   Okay.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.480]   And this is the real, this is a big problem in this country in general.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:22.640]   By the way, I heart media love the company love work and form, hope to continue to work
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:23.640]   for them.
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:30.480]   But like many of these giant radio conglomerates, they had huge debt in order to acquire all
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:32.440]   these stations.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:38.520]   And in fact, charter basically was faced with bankruptcy, just was able to renegotiate and
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:41.440]   really lower their debt.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.440]   And so they survived.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.440]   They had great cash flow.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.840]   They just had insurmountable debt.
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:50.360]   You know, you can at some point own so many billions of dollars that you can't keep up
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:54.320]   with the interest payments, even if you're cash flowing and a profitable business.
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:56.520]   And that's essentially the position they were in.
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:00.280]   Frontier communications, which took over, you know, it's funny because when this happened
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:07.240]   in LA, they took over cable, I think they took over spectrum cable service for a lot
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:12.160]   of people became the incumbent phone company and the ISP in much of LA.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:14.400]   People were furious.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:17.040]   Service went down, quality went down.
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:18.040]   People hated Frontier.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.800]   They were very upset.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:22.840]   Now they say, well, yeah, we have a lot of debt.
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.720]   And so we're looking at chapter 11 bankruptcy.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:28.880]   Couldn't happen to a nicer company.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:31.080]   I just feel bad for all of the cost.
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:32.520]   Yeah, I'm 29 states.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.520]   Thank you.
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.440]   I'm sorry, $356 million in debt, which comes due in two months.
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:40.840]   That's the problem.
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.120]   I hard had the similar problem.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:44.360]   They were able to negotiate with creditors.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:46.240]   Which is what's happening with their newspaper company.
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:51.600]   Klatt McClatchy is sadly probably soon to go bankrupt because of this is why people hate
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.840]   private equity firms.
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:54.840]   And they do what they do.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:01.400]   I was an advisor to what was then called the digital first media under a brilliant CEO
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:02.400]   and he always warned us.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:05.480]   He said, the hedges will do what the hedges do.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:07.520]   They're built to do one thing.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.520]   And we've got to beat the clock to them.
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.720]   But at the end of the day, they're going to do what they do.
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:18.880]   Well, in that cheery note, I feel like some trumpets.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:19.880]   Not yet.
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:21.960]   Oh, we must advertise.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:22.960]   We must advertise.
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:29.760]   But meanwhile, I'm just weeping reading the story about cereal being bumping.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.040]   Oh, I put that.
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:35.480]   See, speaking of cool journalistic acts, that was mine.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.480]   There you go.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:38.360]   Yeah, I put that up there.
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:41.680]   I wanted to see you cry and get some good color from the story.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:42.680]   You know what?
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:43.680]   It's fine.
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:44.680]   What are you going to do?
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:45.680]   Right?
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:46.680]   I'm good for them.
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:47.680]   I'm happy for Sarah.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:51.280]   I'm happy for all the people making a lot of mine.
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.800]   This happens all the time in tech in general, right?
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.320]   I don't tell anybody.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.880]   I call it dumb money.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:04.880]   When you look at somebody like Mark Cuban, who got a billion dollars for broadcast.com
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:06.720]   from Yahoo.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:08.480]   That was instantly shut down.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:09.480]   Instantly shut down.
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:10.960]   Complete waste of money for Yahoo.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:16.080]   He thinks he's the smartest guy ever because he tricked a company to spending a billion
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:18.520]   dollars for his company.
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:19.920]   I call it dumb money.
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.280]   Boy, I'd love some, but you know, it's fine.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:23.280]   It's life.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.560]   If you had taken investment.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:29.240]   Oh, I could have done everything so differently.
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.000]   But investment can...
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000]   Investment's tough.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000]   I...
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000]   No, I didn't want investment.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000]   For that reason.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.800]   I didn't want anybody to tell me what to do.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:38.760]   We are super happy.
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:41.440]   We love where we are and what's going on.
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:44.600]   But if anyone has like a hundred million, maybe a hundred and fifty million and wants
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.320]   to buy Leo, you just go right ahead.
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.800]   I'm thinking the hunger of a hundred fifty.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:48.800]   You could talk him into it.
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:50.160]   You could give him some.
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:51.400]   You know, just try.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:54.600]   You know, the tough thing would be working for somebody for...
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:56.240]   Because usually you get locked in for...
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.240]   You'd have to be.
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:59.240]   Especially this company because you're the core of it.
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:00.760]   I'm sure Bill Simmons would get locked in.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:01.760]   You're the chief twit.
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:02.760]   Spotify.
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:03.760]   Whatever.
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:04.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:05.760]   That's all right.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:06.760]   We're very happy.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:07.760]   We're doing fine.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:08.760]   Thanks to people like...
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:09.860]   Mint Mobile.
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:12.560]   I actually think this is an amazing thing.
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:15.360]   Sometimes the big companies are not the best companies.
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:21.720]   When it comes to cell phone service, wouldn't it be nice to get the same services a T-Mobile
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:22.720]   customer gets?
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:25.200]   Because you're using T-Mobile's towers.
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:27.600]   But for a lot less.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.280]   Enter Ryan Reynolds company.
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:31.280]   Mint Mobile.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:32.280]   Yes.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:37.280]   It's owned by Deadpool.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.120]   Which is the craziest thing ever.
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.440]   But I just love this.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:43.080]   Mint Mobile saves money because they don't have retail stores.
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.560]   They don't have to mark it up.
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.320]   They don't have hidden fees.
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:50.400]   What they do is they're an MVNO for T-Mobile.
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.400]   And get ready.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:53.080]   You get the same premium network coverage you're used to.
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:57.040]   But at an amazingly low cost.
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.280]   They're saving on retail locations.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:03.600]   They're saving on overhead and they're passing those savings on to you.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.760]   Right now you could cut your wireless bill.
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.760]   What do you...
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:12.000]   Just to put this in perspective, think how much you pay a month for wireless.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.760]   Mint Mobile.
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.000]   Unlimited Talk.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.200]   Unlimited Text.
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:22.200]   Three gigs of data.
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.680]   When I went there and I saw this.
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.760]   This is for their three month introductory plan.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:27.760]   When I went there and saw this.
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:28.960]   I said, "Wait a minute.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:30.160]   Okay, that's a good deal.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:31.160]   But if I bought...
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:32.160]   So I want more data.
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:33.160]   I want 12 gigabytes.
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.640]   If I pay ahead for a year, it's $25 a month.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.640]   Unlimited Text.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.360]   Unlimited phone calls.
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:43.320]   12 gigabytes of data more than I would ever use a month.
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.320]   $25.
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:46.160]   There is nobody even close.
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:49.080]   This is amazing.
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.320]   You've got to go to mintmobile.com/twig.
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.320]   Give it a try.
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:55.600]   Choose between three, eight and 12 gigabyte plans.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.680]   4G LTE data.
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:58.800]   You can bring your own phone.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:03.080]   They have a little IMEI checker on the site to see if your phone's compatible.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:04.680]   They also sell your phones.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:07.400]   Ditch your old wireless bill.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.080]   Save so much money.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:12.960]   When I look at all the device money I spend on cell phones, it's like, "Move them all
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.360]   to Mint."
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:15.360]   Mint Mobile.
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:18.400]   To the SIM, they don't even charge you for the SIM.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:20.800]   Other companies will charge you for the SIM, not Mint Mobile.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.560]   You put in your phone suddenly $15 a month.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.720]   They have a three month introductory plan.
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.920]   Mintmobile.com/twig.
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:31.040]   Mintmobile.com/twig.
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:34.880]   Thank you, Mint Mobile, for believing in this week in Google.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:39.320]   Thank you, Twig listeners, for using that special URL because that's how they know.
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:41.120]   I'm not tracking you.
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:42.880]   I don't know that you went there.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:44.480]   If you go there, they'll know.
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:46.840]   Mintmobile.com/twig.
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:51.040]   By the way, we do every year an annual survey of our audience.
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:53.440]   I want Twig listeners to get in on this.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:56.200]   We want to get to know you better because we don't track you.
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:01.640]   We don't do what a lot of these other companies do to try to figure out who you are.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.280]   The survey is the only way we could do that.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.120]   It really helps people do it.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:06.120]   It helps the company.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:07.120]   It helps the company.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.120]   It helps the company.
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:09.120]   The right thing to do.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:10.120]   Mint Mobile will say, "Well, how many men listen?
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:11.120]   How many women listen?"
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:12.120]   So this--
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:13.120]   How smart are they?
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:14.120]   How smart are they?
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:18.040]   So this way, it's completely voluntary.
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:19.520]   You don't have to answer any questions.
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:20.520]   You could skip questions.
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.200]   You don't have to do it at all if you don't want to.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:24.360]   We don't collect personal information.
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:26.280]   This is just in aggregate.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:30.240]   It also helps us with programming so we understand what shows you like and that kind of thing.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:31.240]   Twit.to/survey20.
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:38.040]   It's our annual survey for 2020, the Twit 2020 audience survey.
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:41.880]   Twit.to/survey20.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:48.560]   If you don't get the big Spotify not money or the big New York Times money, you got to
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:49.560]   do it this way.
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:50.560]   You got to do it the hard way.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:51.560]   You got to sell--
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:52.640]   Spotify says we're going to attract people.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.140]   They say it.
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:57.520]   We're going to have exclusive podcasts and we're going to offer advertisers all the information
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.680]   we know from people who use our app because they know exactly how much you listen to when
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:05.760]   you stop listening all that stuff, who you are, what demographic, where you are, all
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.800]   of that stuff they want to give to advertisers.
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:12.200]   It's like, yeah, no, I like to do that.
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:16.560]   All right, now play the trumpets.
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:20.320]   It's time for the Google change log.
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:26.040]   The Google change log.
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:27.600]   This is a big change log.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:28.600]   Get ready.
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:29.640]   I'm going to run right through this.
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:36.760]   If you are a Verizon Fios subscriber, get ready for your free $130 value.
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.000]   It's a media gaming kit.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.480]   You'll be about the only people who can actually play game because you have fiber.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:44.600]   You'll get the Chromecast Ultra, the Stadia.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.920]   I think this is a good promotion.
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:50.120]   When you sign up for a gigabit plan, you'll get the Stadia premiere edition in a three
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:56.480]   month, not a year, but a three month Stadia Pro subscription starting January 29.
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:59.400]   I would get fiber so fast if I could.
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.400]   But I can't.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:06.720]   Google's Pixelbook Go is finally available in pink.
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:08.360]   Waiting for Fiesta Red, man.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:09.520]   Oh, red's nice.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:11.160]   You know, you should look at that Samsung.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:12.160]   Well, not the Samsung.
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:13.160]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.160]   It's going to be a fancy.
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:15.160]   Yeah, that's a beauty.
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:16.160]   Did you see it at the show?
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:17.160]   I did.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:18.160]   What do you think?
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.160]   It's beautiful.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:20.160]   It's a type.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:22.720]   Yeah, I'm a fan of the Samsung Chromebooks.
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:26.160]   I owned the plus and the I didn't get the pro, but I liked the plus.
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:27.800]   In fact, I bought two pluses.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:29.480]   My daughter still uses her plus.
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.120]   Those are great Chromebooks.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:32.120]   They make very good ones.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:33.720]   Now it's not going to be inexpensive.
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:39.360]   But neither is this Pixelbook Go $849 if you want pink.
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:40.760]   Took them three months.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.600]   I don't know.
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:45.080]   $849 for an M3.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:47.240]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.880]   I5 is a 49.
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.440]   They don't have the M3 for pink.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:51.440]   That's why.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:53.280]   Oh, it's like.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:56.040]   Yeah, it's really.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:58.120]   I don't know.
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:00.280]   Google gets away with it, I guess.
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:07.040]   Google Classroom is another tool that Google offers.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:10.560]   Very popular in education that goes with those Chromebooks.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:11.960]   Google is, I don't even know what this means.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.200]   So I'm just going to say it.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:18.240]   Google is launching a new rubric and originality report tools for all G Suite for education
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:19.240]   customers.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:20.600]   There I said it.
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:23.400]   I like saying the word rubric.
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:25.720]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:30.120]   A lot of classrooms, I assume that's rubrics that you can share with your students so they
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:31.440]   know how to define with it.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:32.440]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:37.320]   Rubrics are what teachers use to kind of define the assignment clearly, right?
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:41.280]   It's really helpful because they say, hey, we're going to grade you on clarity.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:43.240]   Do you do this, this, and this?
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:45.240]   And then they'll-- yeah.
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:49.720]   My daughter, I have jealous that I did not have rubrics when I was being taught.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:51.800]   Oh, it makes it much easier to do an assignment.
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.280]   So Google offers rubrics.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.280]   Actually, this was in beta.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:57.720]   That's now exiting beta.
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:01.600]   When starting assignment, rubrics can be easily created by teachers and made available to
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:02.600]   students.
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:05.160]   They could be reused as well as exported and imported.
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:12.800]   The rubric will then appear for the teacher during grading so they do know what is expected.
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:18.240]   And they're also expanding a test that allows classroom to sync grades with school information
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:25.120]   systems, capital sims, infinite campus, and skyward SMS 2.0 right now and more coming.
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:26.720]   I'm not an educator.
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:29.120]   So all of this is Greek to me.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:30.880]   Actually, I know Greek.
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:32.640]   It's not even Greek to me.
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:36.200]   Google Podcasts.
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.680]   It's not even Greek.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:42.200]   Google Podcasts lets you share time-stamped podcast episodes.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:46.320]   You know, that's a nice feature because then you can say, hey, listen to this part.
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:49.360]   Listen to this person say something crazy at this point.
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:51.360]   You can do that with YouTube.
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:52.360]   Baropanic!
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:53.360]   Listen for that.
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:52:00.800]   Actually tweet with a link that jumps right to moral panic or minds.
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:05.120]   Listen, you won't believe what Jeff said about minds.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:08.840]   So there's now in the Google Podcast, they always share episode.
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.840]   There's not share from current time.
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:13.520]   That's exactly like YouTube.
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:14.520]   That's nice.
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:18.320]   It embeds the current time in the URL.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.320]   Google.
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:24.320]   How can I do a show called this week in Google and not be able to pronounce the word Google?
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:29.600]   Google Duo on the web no longer requires a phone number.
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:30.600]   Hallelujah.
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:33.360]   I didn't know it did.
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:37.960]   Well, I think it was tied to your phone, right?
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:39.920]   I don't know.
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:40.920]   I always use it.
[01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:43.760]   Ask me about Google calling messaging hangouts, messages, whatever.
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.760]   So complicated.
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:45.920]   It's crazy.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:50.400]   Google is now, remember we were mentioning this Chromebook eight year timeline.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:55.760]   Now they've set a final timeline for killing and replacing Chrome apps.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:58.720]   I had an immediate reaction to that like, oh no.
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:01.000]   Then I thought I haven't used a Chrome app.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.360]   It was a kind of cookie idea.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:05.520]   Chrome first had extensions.
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:09.840]   And then they said, and I never really understood the distinction, but now this is an app, which
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:13.040]   means it kind of lives by itself as standalone thing.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.760]   It's not an extension.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:21.240]   Meaning substantial progress since apps were introduced in 2013, Google believes modern
[01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:25.400]   browsers put the web in a good position answer the vast majority of use cases.
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:31.400]   In other words, you don't need a packaged app anymore.
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:36.200]   Google Earth, for instance, Figma and PWAs are still around.
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:39.320]   This does not affect PWAs of the future, I think.
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:40.320]   Yes.
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.280]   So the web apps.
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:48.440]   So that's apps written with the same technologies as the Google Apps, HTML5, CSS JavaScript.
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.720]   But they look like standalone apps.
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:53.000]   They have service workers, which means they operate offline.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.880]   There's a lot of benefits to program, progressive web apps.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:00.280]   The best is that it's cross-platform.
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:08.520]   It helps Google, but also works on Apple, works on desktops, works everywhere.
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:14.960]   We were talking about this on Mac break weekly yesterday because Apple is going to be facing
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:23.440]   this US Supreme Court over the monopsony of the app store.
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:25.920]   I think this is their best argument against it.
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:30.240]   Well, you could still get a PWA to run from anybody.
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:35.680]   They told Playboy, and Playboy said, "Apple won't let us have a new D calendar app on
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:36.680]   the iPhone.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:37.840]   It's too adult."
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.800]   Apple said, "Well, you can still do a web thing.
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:42.800]   Do a web app."
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:47.480]   I imagine those will get better and better on iOS as an alternative.
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:51.760]   What else is going on?
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:54.920]   Oh, this was the best story.
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:58.760]   Are you going to go and get a special envelope for your phone?
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:54:59.760]   No.
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:00.760]   Come on.
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:07.840]   Actually, I will tell them what's going to give you my tip.
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:08.840]   This is Google.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:09.840]   Oh, it's going to be your tip?
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.640]   No, no, this is not my tip.
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:12.640]   No, that's not my tip.
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:16.120]   I'm going to carry a microwave around with me and put it in there.
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:21.600]   Google releases three new experimental apps to help cut down on your phone usage.
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:24.800]   This is part of their digital well-being initiative.
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:26.720]   Number one, envelope.
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:28.440]   It only currently works with the 3A.
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:29.440]   There's a reason.
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:32.520]   It's not just any old envelope.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:35.960]   You can still dial.
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:40.080]   To get started, you print out a special PDF provided by the app, fold it into the shape
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:45.080]   of an envelope, seal your phone inside, and then use it through the paper, only having
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:49.880]   access to two things, the dialer and the camera.
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:51.800]   Oh, stupid.
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:58.440]   Then it will tell you, you've used the envelope for eight hours today.
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:55:59.880]   Place your phone in the envelope and seal it.
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:03.480]   You can lock and unlock your phone using the fingerprint.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:04.480]   That's kind of cool.
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:05.480]   I don't know.
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:06.480]   What do you think?
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:07.480]   No, it's not.
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:09.480]   Does the PDF have a hole for your camera?
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:10.480]   It must.
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:11.480]   That's really complicated cutting.
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:12.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:13.480]   I failed scissors when I was...
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:14.920]   Yeah, it's going to look pretty bad.
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:16.920]   I mean, it looks good in the picture.
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:17.920]   Well, yeah.
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:20.880]   It's going to look pretty bad when you do it.
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:21.880]   Right.
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:26.960]   Okay, so my thing is, you know how you guys told me that I could turn on Do Not Disturb
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:29.400]   mode if I flip my phone on the ground.
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:30.400]   Face down, yeah.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.400]   Face down.
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:32.400]   God, I love that.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.880]   I'm never on my phone unless I want to be.
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:34.880]   Right.
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:35.880]   And it's just amazing.
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:38.520]   And all these annoying people who try to call me, I don't have to hear from you.
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:39.520]   Can't do it.
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:41.560]   I'm face down right now.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:42.920]   Because that's my default setting.
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:47.280]   And when we go out to eat or something like that, if my phone is out, which it usually
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:49.120]   isn't, it's face down.
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:50.960]   All those, then I can't listen to music.
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:52.880]   I turn Do Not Disturb on all the time.
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:55.840]   I just have a thing that goes from 11.
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:56.840]   What is it?
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:58.640]   From midnight to 11.59 PM.
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:02.320]   And so I'm always in Do Not Disturb because I don't ever want to talk to anybody.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.320]   Well that's true.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:05.160]   And maybe that's being my mom or my mom.
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:08.080]   My daughter did tell me that I was just old.
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:11.280]   Well, I was like, I don't want to talk to people.
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.360]   She's like, it's because you're old mom and cranky.
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:15.600]   It's all really, she's right on all count to me.
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:16.920]   You're young to her.
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:17.920]   You're old.
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:18.920]   It's all really.
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:21.880]   You're just to me to Jeff and me.
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:24.720]   You're like our junior member.
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:27.440]   I'm your junior queen of IoT.
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:30.280]   I think you're going to get, yeah, punching.
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:33.760]   I'm like, somewhere somewhere there is somebody to be punched about.
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:35.400]   Just teasing you.
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:37.960]   Activity bubbles, this is, there's three different things.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:45.280]   Activity bubbles, this, every time you unlock your phone, your wallpaper creates a bubble
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.880]   on the wallpaper.
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:51.600]   And then the longer on your phone, the bigger the bubble.
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:54.080]   And then when you lock it, the bubble stops growing.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:59.720]   By the end of the day, if your phone is full of bubbles, you've been doing it too much.
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:03.920]   You've been doing good things with your life and you've made your own damn choices in your
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:06.880]   adult and this device should not be telling you what to do.
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:07.880]   I like this.
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:12.360]   I do think this helps people who may not be aware of how much time they spend on their
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:13.360]   phone.
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:14.360]   Or how often they unlock it.
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:17.960]   Because a lot of people, just, it's a deep, they're not even interested.
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.760]   They just do it totally.
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:23.880]   I sometimes watch my husband, like he wakes up, he picks up his phone, he looks at it,
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:24.880]   he like pushes some things.
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:26.360]   Someone's like, "What are you doing?"
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:30.720]   He's like, "I don't even know."
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:34.280]   Activity bubbles is already available in the app store.
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:35.720]   As is the envelope, you can download it.
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:39.280]   I'm going to download it right now on my Pixel 3 XL.
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:41.080]   What are you talking about?
[01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:42.720]   Willis, how about a Pixel 4?
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:43.720]   Let's try that.
[01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:45.720]   It says, "New in Android 6."
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:48.080]   What are they talking about?
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:50.680]   All right, I'll do that later.
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:55.680]   Finally, I like this, screen stopwatch.
[01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:58.680]   A giant live wallpaper.
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:00.880]   I guess you can't use this and bubbles.
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:05.800]   The displays your phone usage in real time, exactly how many hours, minutes, and seconds
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:08.320]   you've spent on your phone today.
[01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:15.560]   When your phone's locked, the counter stops every time you unlock it.
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:17.400]   And that's that.
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:20.120]   Don't you go into your phone and just see how much time you've spent on it?
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:22.680]   Yes, it's in there, but now they're surfacing it, right?
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:23.680]   That's the idea.
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:24.680]   I would actually like to.
[01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:33.440]   I, like an idiot, thought that when my daughter went up to her room to read, read, I didn't
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:41.360]   realize she was stealing the iPad and just watching more Netflix.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:45.640]   She and I will watch a show, but she's always very good about not needing to watch.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:47.040]   She's like, "Oh, Benjig is boring.
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.480]   I'm going to watch one or two episodes and then I go away."
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:51.960]   But then she goes upstairs and watches something else.
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:52.960]   Shocked.
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:53.960]   I was.
[01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:54.960]   Shocking.
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:57.360]   Shocking dereliction.
[01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:58.360]   Which would you like?
[01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:02.840]   I think I like the bubbles better than the timer, but you can, you get your choice.
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:03.840]   All of these.
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:05.320]   Get off my lawn.
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:10.320]   Jeff, you just, you don't, you can't deal with it, can you?
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:13.120]   You just, you know, I do deal with it.
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:14.120]   I choose what to use.
[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:16.040]   I don't want anybody to be my nanny.
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:17.040]   Well, I do.
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:18.840]   Some people have a hard time.
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:21.840]   Yes, some people want that, but, but you don't.
[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:24.040]   See, that's, that's, that's right.
[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:25.040]   No.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:29.720]   I think some people are unaware of the time they spent on their phone and if made aware
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:36.240]   of it, they might be like, "Holy crap, I'm spending six hours a day doing what?"
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:38.280]   It could be your number, Jeff.
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:40.240]   Just think of that.
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:41.240]   No.
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:42.240]   I'm trying to.
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:43.240]   No.
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:44.240]   It's not my number.
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:47.720]   Oh, are we, are we done with the change look?
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:50.040]   We are done with the Google change law.
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:52.520]   I have to run downstairs to get my thing.
[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:53.520]   Go run downstairs.
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:54.520]   Sorry.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:01:00.200]   While you're running downstairs, I shall turn to Professor Jeff Jarvis for his thing of
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:01.760]   the week.
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:08.880]   So I was in Best Buy Today, hoping that soon I'll see the Fiesta Red Chromebook and it's
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:09.880]   not there yet.
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:16.200]   But I did see that there were Lenovo Chromebooks selling normal price now for $139.
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:17.200]   Wow.
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:18.200]   Wow.
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:19.200]   Wow.
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:20.200]   Wow.
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:21.200]   Wow.
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:24.320]   And then I went back and I looked at the, remember the one laptop per child thing, the
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:25.320]   close, Negropunty of the...
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:26.800]   I have one in my office.
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:27.800]   I do too.
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:28.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:35.400]   Now Defamed MIT Media Lab did and how that was the, it was an unbelievable goal to get
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:37.240]   a laptop down to $100.
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:38.240]   Yep.
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:42.960]   And we're pretty much, the market's pretty much about ready to be there, perfectly workable
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:46.240]   and connected to the whole world of information.
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:50.400]   And I just found that amazing, even a little bit inspiring.
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:51.800]   That's all.
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:52.800]   I agree.
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:53.800]   That's a really good point.
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:59.400]   And I think in many ways it's probably more useful than the one laptop per child.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:02.200]   I tried to work with that device.
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:04.360]   It was, everything was in scratch and...
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:06.240]   Oh, it was cute looking.
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:08.640]   Hey, one more thing I'll add to the change log.
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:09.640]   Thank you ScooterX.
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:11.280]   I did know this but I forgot.
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:12.720]   PlayStation is phasing out.
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:17.560]   It's over the top TV service called View.
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:20.160]   YouTube TV is leaping into the gap.
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:24.000]   It is now or will soon be available on the PlayStation 4.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.920]   So if you're using PlayStation View, I think you only have a few weeks left.
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:31.280]   YouTube TV wants to be your alternative.
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:34.920]   Look, I put the little, there's only one little bubble on the bottom.
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:35.920]   It's bigger.
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:36.920]   It's getting bigger.
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:39.800]   Next week I'll show you my bubbles.
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:44.320]   Oh, can I mention one more thing where we have a face?
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:49.000]   So my friend Sameer Aurora, I mentioned this I think two weeks ago, has a new company called
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.800]   Sage which is not public yet but I wrote a post about it.
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:53.440]   It is an expert network.
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:59.280]   And he's starting with travel because the entities are very clear to work with and they
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:02.280]   hand selected 100 experts for the sites that they have.
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:05.000]   Then those people then selected a total of a thousand.
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.760]   And then that was a learning set for the AI to take over.
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:14.360]   And now they have five million verifiable restaurants, hotels and such and the opinions
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:15.360]   about them.
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:22.360]   And I believe that he's on to something here and that the next generation of the net that
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:25.960]   we need is one that brings in expertise and authority and that means you got to figure
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:30.200]   out who's an expert and who's not and who's full of assets and who's not.
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:31.200]   But that's the challenge.
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:32.200]   We have to pay for this service.
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:33.200]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:34.200]   How does it monetize?
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:39.680]   You're going to be able to, the service, let's say you're an expert.
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:42.000]   You're an expert in many things, Leo.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.760]   It's free to you.
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:48.360]   You can have many business models with your fans.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:49.880]   Advertising is not on it yet.
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:50.880]   It may not be.
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:53.240]   But you could, I could just be your fan.
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:54.240]   You could send me to your website.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:55.240]   That's where you make the money.
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:57.320]   So I would be curating content.
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:58.320]   Exactly.
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:03.920]   Or you could do it on Sage and you could charge me a monthly fee.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:05.840]   You could charge me for a one-time product.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:11.040]   You could charge me for an event, for a consulting thing, for a chat.
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:14.640]   It tries to have a wide set of business models.
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:16.400]   I don't need no New York Times money.
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:17.680]   I could just do this.
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:18.680]   Right.
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:19.680]   That's the idea.
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:21.000]   So here's a very smart.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000]   Is it available?
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.520]   I'm looking at this from the presentation.
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:26.720]   So there's a curated experts web.
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:27.720]   There's a social.
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:30.240]   He's talking about this has kind of been the progression of the web as a whole.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:31.240]   Oh, I see.
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:32.240]   This is the past.
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:34.520]   This is the coming through the bottom to the top.
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:36.800]   We're now at the experts curated web.
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:37.800]   Right.
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:38.800]   That's what he's building now.
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:39.800]   Because that's what you always do when you make a PowerPoint.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:40.800]   You put yourself on the top.
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:41.800]   Yes, of course.
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:42.800]   So it's not there yet.
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:44.360]   A little frustrating because you can't play with it yet.
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:45.360]   In fact, it's for iOS.
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:47.440]   And I live with a bit of Google.
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:49.000]   So I couldn't fully play with it yet.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.560]   But I spent a long time with him and his team to get the sense of it.
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:55.560]   And I think he's on to something very important here.
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:59.560]   So a little preview for the world that hasn't been written about anywhere else yet.
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:00.560]   Oh my god.
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:01.560]   It's a scoop.
[02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:02.560]   It's a scoop.
[02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:03.560]   It's a scoop.
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:04.560]   But it's a place.
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:05.960]   Who's going to get fired because we've revealed this?
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:07.320]   I don't want to do it.
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:10.080]   It's a friendly scoop, friendly scoop from Sameer.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:11.680]   And I have no business relationship.
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:12.680]   That's just market.
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:15.440]   He bought me a cup of coffee in a very nice place in Palo Alto.
[02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:17.280]   That was it.
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:18.280]   What happened to Glam?
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:19.840]   That was his other company.
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:27.240]   It yeah, it imploded in investor politics and programmatic advertising.
[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:28.880]   It seemed like such a good idea.
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:29.880]   It was a blog.
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:32.200]   Well, Sameer and I bonded.
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:35.880]   I make reference to the world's history's ugliest PowerPoint slide because he came in
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:37.600]   and I was talking about networks, networks, networks.
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:43.080]   And he came in and he talked about Glam, which was an open network of fashion blogs versus
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:48.080]   iVillage, which was a closed media company owning it and how much better the network
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:49.080]   is.
[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:51.240]   And that's where he and I bonded because we believed in the network model and I still
[02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:52.240]   do.
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:54.240]   I think we all do.
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.240]   Who is this partner?
[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:57.240]   He was a former Obama guy.
[02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:04.800]   Well, he also, the problem was the board of the German publisher invested in it and got
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:05.800]   cool feet.
[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:08.800]   But he also bought Ning for Man Driessen.
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:10.680]   And Driessen was on the board.
[02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:14.600]   So it was an idea that you could build your own community.
[02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:17.600]   Sameer did net objects way back in the day.
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:18.680]   Oh, okay.
[02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:21.400]   So he's always been about building tools for creation.
[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:24.480]   So he's a friend and I'm impressed by where he's headed.
[02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:26.280]   So take a look at that folks.
[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:27.280]   Nice.
[02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:30.320]   Stacy, what's your thing this week?
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:31.760]   Today's thing.
[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:32.760]   Yes.
[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:33.760]   Is.
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:36.440]   Oh, I know what that is.
[02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:37.440]   Is that from Casper?
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:38.440]   It's a glow.
[02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:39.440]   It is.
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:40.440]   It's a glow.
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:41.440]   I recognize that.
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:42.440]   I bought it a while back here.
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:46.400]   I'm going to do my camera down so you can see the glowing orb.
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:47.400]   Oh, okay.
[02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:49.840]   I'm going to have to move the glowing over up.
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:50.840]   All right.
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:52.920]   So this is brighter because of her camera.
[02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:53.920]   It's not that bright.
[02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:55.640]   It's not blinding with bright.
[02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:56.840]   Oh, it's not doing it.
[02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:57.840]   Oh, I'm doing it the wrong way.
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:00.400]   Sorry, I'm looking at it and I'm having a hard time.
[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:02.920]   So when I turn it, it it dims.
[02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:06.240]   It's just on a charging stand, by the way, that you can lift it off.
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:07.240]   This is a charge.
[02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:10.760]   And when I lift off of it, I turn it off by flipping it over.
[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:12.840]   I turn it on by flipping it over.
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:14.760]   Stacy, you have such power.
[02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:16.680]   You have electric hands.
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:19.720]   But it's this lasts for six hours.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:20.920]   It's on a timer.
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:23.720]   So if I want to and I can turn it off by.
[02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:27.000]   Can I turn it? Oh, no, that stops it when I tap it.
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.640]   But you can.
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:33.040]   It's just a fun little sorry.
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:35.720]   It dims down over a set period of time.
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:39.800]   So right now I think it's set to 30 minutes where it'll over 30 minutes.
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:40.800]   It gets softer.
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:42.960]   I think it's such a brilliant idea.
[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:45.560]   And we should mention Casper is a sponsor, of course.
[02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:46.960]   Oh, they are still a spy.
[02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:47.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:48.960]   Yeah, we love Casper.
[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:50.080]   I didn't really say.
[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:53.320]   We mentioned them when they filed last week for their S1.
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:56.920]   But yes, so I just wanted to show this.
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:57.920]   It is 70.
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:04.840]   No, it's 129 for one or 229 for two.
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:08.080]   I find that it is not awesome to read by.
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:10.800]   No, it's not quite bright enough to read by.
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:12.800]   It's all right, but it's not.
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:15.520]   It'd be good to browse a magazine by.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:19.920]   Yeah, if it's if it's if it's not the New Yorker or the Economist, I will say.
[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:20.920]   Which is what I read before.
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:24.680]   But she needs three glows and then you could read.
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:25.680]   And you can sink.
[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:27.760]   If you have multiple ones, you can sink them via Bluetooth.
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:31.840]   I got this as a Christmas present for my daughter and she freaking.
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:32.840]   That's sweet.
[02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:34.520]   Oh, that's really what is she?
[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:35.520]   How does she use it?
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:36.520]   She uses it actually.
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:39.280]   She finds her alarm too jarring in the morning.
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:40.880]   Yeah, it's a great way to wake up.
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:42.640]   She uses it as a wake up.
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:46.880]   And then she also uses it just like just around for fun.
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:53.200]   We also when the power went out for 17 hours last week, we used it then.
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:59.640]   The only complaint I have is that it charges it's got a the charging cable.
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:04.480]   I would like this to be micro USB so I could charge it and other things.
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:08.040]   But that's a pretty small niggle or type C even better.
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.040]   Or title.
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:10.840]   Yeah, I don't care whichever.
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:11.920]   I brought this home.
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:14.360]   You know, I reviewed it and I like you gave it a positive.
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:15.360]   I love it.
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:16.360]   I think it's great.
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:17.880]   Life really didn't like the ice.
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:21.920]   She doesn't want any light in the bedroom at all period.
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.680]   She just want to see you.
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:24.680]   Okay.
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:25.680]   Well, that's actually it.
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:26.680]   That is.
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:28.720]   Yeah, I was like, this is her dream date right now.
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:30.240]   All the lights are up.
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:31.240]   Oh, did you.
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:35.280]   Oh, someone, are you asking me to wiggle the light?
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:36.280]   Wiggle it.
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:37.920]   What happens when you wiggle it?
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:39.880]   It's supposed to go lower, but it's not going lower.
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:41.720]   Oh, I think it's when it's off.
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:43.160]   It has to go to the bathroom.
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:44.160]   Yeah.
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:45.160]   And you wiggle it.
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:46.160]   No, it's the don't step on light.
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:47.720]   Okay, now it's more like, but you really can't.
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:48.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:49.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:51.280]   Oh, what if I turned off my light?
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:56.480]   Wow, we're getting fancy with the production now.
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:57.800]   The camera just adjusts.
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:09:59.440]   Camera camera.
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:00.520]   You don't even need that light.
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:01.680]   The camera goes, oh, it's dark.
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:03.640]   I better turn myself up.
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:04.640]   Sorry.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:05.640]   Yeah.
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:06.640]   The camera is compensating.
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:09.480]   Oh, shucks.
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:12.040]   I want to.
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:15.000]   We haven't had Kevin Marks on in ages to talk about the.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000]   Yeah.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000]   The free and open web.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.040]   We'll get him back on soon.
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:22.120]   But I want to give a plug to software.
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:26.120]   In fact, I interviewed the guy who invented this software many moons ago on triangulation,
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:27.120]   Word cutting him.
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:30.960]   I want to give a plug to wiki software.
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:36.080]   The idea of wiki, it comes from the Hawaiian wiki, wiki buses, the fast buses that go around
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.080]   Honolulu.
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:44.840]   The idea is it's a fast and easy website to create and then very easy to edit.
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:51.720]   In fact, I call my wiki, it's our family wiki, the 4am wiki because I got up at 4 in the
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:52.720]   morning.
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:54.560]   I didn't know what to do so I made one.
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:56.760]   So it's that easy to make.
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:11:00.000]   It's a very easy thing to do.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000]   Anybody can edit it.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.560]   You don't have to be an expert in web technology.
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:06.000]   There's some basic markup.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.160]   The syntax is fairly simple.
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:15.160]   And they even have this one is called docu wiki but there are thousands, maybe not that many
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:21.600]   dozens of different wiki platforms including the best known wiki in the world, wiki pedia.
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:23.080]   We even have our own wiki.
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:27.600]   I might as well mention that as long as we're talking wikis that you can edit if you want.
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:32.880]   wiki.twit.tv it's our official wiki and it has what wiki.
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:34.040]   I love wikis.
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:37.720]   It's an easy way to create content.
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:39.640]   You can open it to the public like wikipedia.
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:46.440]   In our case because we don't have a lot of editors and wikipedia does, we ask you to
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:48.320]   request access.
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:53.200]   So if you'd like to contribute there's a form you can fill out and Patrick Delahanty will
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:54.960]   just say okay fine.
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:57.800]   But that way we keep spammers out and that kind of thing.
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:02.200]   But it's a really great, there's a this week in Google page on it.
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:06.520]   It's very easy for people to edit it, add material and so forth.
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:09.160]   And I just, I really am a fan of wikis.
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:11.040]   So I just wanted to give a little plug.
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:15.960]   In this case the wiki was very easy to set up because I have a Synology NAS and Synology
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:19.160]   has docu wiki as part of its one click installs.
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:21.200]   It's very easy to make it.
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:22.200]   This is not public.
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:26.480]   This is something that Lisa and I use because we're planning upcoming travel and I put stuff
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:28.520]   in here that I want to keep track of.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:31.600]   But it's very easy way to have a web page.
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:32.600]   It could be public.
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:33.600]   Oh, with Yale people.
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:34.600]   Oh my.
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:35.880]   Oh, that's going to be fun.
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:37.960]   Yeah, we're going on a river cruise.
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:39.680]   You would you would enjoy this.
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:41.800]   I would my wife would hate it.
[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:43.840]   We're starting in Budapest.
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:44.840]   We're going to Baratas.
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:47.360]   Oh, love Vienna, the Wacau Valley.
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:50.800]   Melk Abbey where they're famous for their apricot liqueur.
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:51.800]   We get off in Pasau.
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:54.720]   We go to Salzburg where Mozart was born.
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:55.800]   Oberama Gao.
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:13:00.020]   This is the thing that your wife might enjoy which is every 10 years, a little medieval
[02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:06.600]   town of Oberama Gao prayed during the 16th century that if you pass us over with a plague,
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:12.560]   we will dedicate in your honor a every 10 years, every decade a passion play.
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:17.720]   And they've been doing it ever since the 2020 version is coming up this summer.
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:21.480]   2000 residents of the town all participate.
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:25.480]   And I imagine there's like a little fist fight to get to see you get to be Jesus.
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:26.480]   We get to be Jesus.
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:27.480]   Yes.
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:29.640]   There's probably murders over that.
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:34.460]   And then we're going to go to the famous mad King Ludwig's Castle Le Schwanstein.
[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:36.620]   Do you get to go to mines?
[02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:40.980]   I've looked for mines as we pass it on Zireva.
[02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:43.180]   And then we're ending up with Munich.
[02:13:43.180 --> 02:13:44.620]   We're going to, oh, we're not going to use that far.
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:45.620]   We're on the Danube.
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:46.620]   And then we're going to Munich.
[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:50.140]   I've been to mines last time I was on the river cruise.
[02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:53.740]   And we're going to take, we're taking our 17 year old and we're going to take him to
[02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:54.740]   Dachau.
[02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:56.780]   So he gets a little history.
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:58.780]   It's very hard.
[02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:00.160]   Yeah, so that's going to be fun.
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:01.160]   But you see, is this nice?
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:04.580]   And then he can go here and he can, he can find out what we're going to do.
[02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:08.720]   There's a little calendar on here so he can see all the little, the different things we're
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:10.640]   going to be doing day by day and stuff.
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:12.640]   I think wikis are really neat.
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:16.840]   I don't think I've ever thought that much about wikis.
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:17.840]   Well now you have.
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:18.840]   Oh, indeed.
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:19.840]   This is my 4am wiki.
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:20.840]   There was a case.
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:21.840]   There was a case.
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:22.840]   Wikipedia all the time.
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:23.840]   That's a wiki.
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:24.840]   No, I know.
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:28.000]   And I go on wikis for various TV shows that I like.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.900]   I mean, I just have not spent a lot of time thinking about wikis.
[02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:35.860]   It's just a long ago, the one, the early days, the early innocent, wonderful days of the
[02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:39.100]   internet, the Los Angeles Times decided that no, there's this new thing called wikis.
[02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:40.860]   Let's do a wiki toriel.
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:46.820]   It was an editorial on a wiki and they chose as the topic the Iraq war.
[02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:49.900]   Oh, hey, crowdsource this editorial.
[02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:53.320]   You know how quickly it went completely to the dogs because they didn't understand that
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:57.020]   wiki was about consensus, not about fighting.
[02:14:57.020 --> 02:15:03.960]   That's one of the most amazing things about wikipedia is how well that works.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:08.640]   Jimmy Wales saw that at the time and I blogged it and Jimmy came in and said, oh yeah, you're
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:09.640]   right.
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:10.640]   This is the criteria.
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:11.640]   He tried it a little bit.
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:12.880]   He said, fork it.
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:15.000]   Have two sides present their best arguments.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.280]   That's the way to use wiki.
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:17.280]   But they do.
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:19.440]   And in fact, breaking news on wikipedia is amazing.
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:22.040]   It's a great way to hear both sides.
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:24.760]   Yeah, it's just really well done.
[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:26.160]   I say fork it all the time.
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:29.280]   In fact, I'm going to say fork it right now.
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:32.100]   Do you watch the place?
[02:15:32.100 --> 02:15:33.100]   Yes, yes.
[02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:34.860]   That's what I was thinking to you.
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:39.660]   I was like, yeah, because she can't swear because she's in the good place or not.
[02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:41.900]   I don't know where she is, but she can't swear.
[02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:47.900]   And so every time she tries to swear, it's kind of these funny family friendly versions.
[02:15:47.900 --> 02:15:50.500]   My daughter always wants it.
[02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:54.940]   She's like, what's up, my benches?
[02:15:54.940 --> 02:15:56.460]   I wish that would spread.
[02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:57.460]   I love that.
[02:15:57.460 --> 02:15:58.460]   I love that.
[02:15:58.460 --> 02:15:59.460]   That's great.
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:00.460]   You know what?
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:03.820]   From now on, when I swear here, I'm going to say the things I have to watch the good
[02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:07.620]   place first and make a make a watch that I've watched a little bit.
[02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:08.620]   I like it.
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:10.420]   You have to you have to you cannot pick up the middle.
[02:16:10.420 --> 02:16:11.420]   You have to go from the beginning.
[02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:13.420]   Yeah, no, I've started as a sequence.
[02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:14.420]   Yeah.
[02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:15.420]   Okay.
[02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:18.220]   Is there a good place glossary anywhere of all the good place?
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:21.060]   Swear, some wiki has been made of that.
[02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:22.060]   Here it is.
[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:23.060]   Here it is.
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:25.060]   Not bench.
[02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:26.060]   Here it is.
[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:27.060]   Fork.
[02:16:27.060 --> 02:16:29.300]   No, that's, is this it or is this it?
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:30.380]   Sensored curse words.
[02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:33.860]   This is on the good place wiki.
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:43.900]   Fork shirt, bench, ash, cork and deck, which allows NBC to air the show at 8.30 p.m.
[02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:45.700]   Enough said.
[02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:52.020]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the concluding moments of this fine television,
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:55.540]   radio podcast program.
[02:16:55.540 --> 02:17:00.140]   If you are not yet a subscriber to Stacey Hagan-Botham's fantastic IOT newsletter, you
[02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:03.300]   must go immediately to Stacey on IOT.com and sign up.

[02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:11.980]   and learn all about IOT.
[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:16.940]   Of course, Stacey, we were thrilled and to be graced by her presence every week here
[02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:17.940]   on Twink.
[02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:18.940]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:20.980]   Thank you for having me.
[02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:22.300]   Love it.
[02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:24.500]   We also thank Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[02:17:24.500 --> 02:17:27.020]   You're also saddled with me, but you know, I can't.
[02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:28.020]   Saddled with him.
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:29.020]   I'm sticking.
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:30.020]   You can't.
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:31.020]   You can't.
[02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:32.020]   I'm the last guy to leave the party.
[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:33.020]   Good.
[02:17:33.020 --> 02:17:34.020]   I count on that, Jeff.
[02:17:34.020 --> 02:17:38.340]   Director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School
[02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:40.380]   of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:41.380]   Oh, my goodness.
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:44.980]   And we are honored by his presence each and every week.
[02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:50.900]   Can we just get a, I feel like there should be like a T-shirt or something of Jeff's like
[02:17:50.900 --> 02:17:52.900]   hiding behind his lower throat.
[02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:54.900]   I know that would be good.
[02:17:54.900 --> 02:17:56.380]   That would be good.
[02:17:56.380 --> 02:17:58.380]   We didn't get to his life show in Z-space.
[02:17:58.380 --> 02:17:59.380]   Sorry.
[02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:00.380]   There was a story.
[02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:02.380]   There was a story with the life show.
[02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:03.380]   Should we start?
[02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:04.380]   I know.
[02:18:04.380 --> 02:18:05.380]   Can we do it next week?
[02:18:05.380 --> 02:18:06.380]   Yeah, we'll do it next week.
[02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:13.980]   They draft of their copyright reform, proposes that memes should only be 128 pixels and video
[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:15.420]   limited to three seconds.
[02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:16.820]   That's enough for a meme.
[02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:17.820]   That's enough.
[02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:19.700]   That's shorter than a vine.
[02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:20.700]   I know.
[02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:21.700]   It's just goofy.
[02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:22.700]   It's just bad.
[02:18:22.700 --> 02:18:23.700]   It's just goofy.
[02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:24.700]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:25.700]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:29.380]   Thank you all for being here.
