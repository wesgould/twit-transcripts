[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   This week in Google, let's show the couples Google and the Google verse and the Facebook and the Twitter verse and all that verses.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Verse one Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IOT.com.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Hello Stacey dance.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   She did.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I like that.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   So you got the head.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   You can do the head thing with the neck.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   The head thing?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Like the...
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   No, no, no.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   You did it differently.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   You were doing the side one.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Oh, you did.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Yeah, that was it.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Like an Egyptian.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Nice.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I feel like a bobblehead.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   All right.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   New title.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Bobblehead Higginbotham.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   He's also one of our regular heads.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   He is...
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Can't do it.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   ...flocksitbudmachine.com.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And of course teaches journalism to a bunch of very lucky kids at the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Also in studio with me as always, and pro at from our very own Twig Network.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   What's your shirt say?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Apparently it says...
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Do you pick these intentionally or is it just whatever is in the top of the laundry basket?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Usually whatever's clean.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Whatever's going to keep me warm.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   It's good though.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It's like an editorial comment on the show.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Pretty much.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   It's okay.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It's a sub-tweet as a t-shirt.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Sub-tweeting.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Sub-tweeting.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's on this show I learned what sub-tweeting is.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Google's year in search is at...
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Okay, we got two things.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   We got Google's YouTube Rewind.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   [GASP]
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And we got the year in the forest.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   This is better this year.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   It was a promise.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It's better.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   It's not better.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   It's worse.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You can't make anybody happy.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   This time though...
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   It wasn't as cheesy.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   This time it's not...
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So normally what the Rewind is is a chance I think to kiss up to the big name creators and keep them happy.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   They tell a story and they have cameos from all the big name creators in it.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Last year's was the most hated YouTube video of all time.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   They did it.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So they decided, oh, we blew it.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Back here they admit we blew it.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   This is the beginning of the YouTube Rewind.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   K-pop!
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   There's Casey Neistel.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That is so awkward to watch.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   YouTube Rewind 2018, the most disliked video in the history of YouTube.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It's a 16 million thumbs down.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It says in 2018 we made something you didn't like.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   So let's see what you did like in 2019.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And so now it's all...
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I'll turn off the sound because we don't need to hear it.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But it's all clips.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It's not...
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   It's like top 10 clips.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   No storyline or anything.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And it's also designed to make me feel terrible because this is the top 5 videos
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   The views in one year, one year, these are the videos that got the most views.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Number 10, 1.9 billion views.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Billion views.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Billion views.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   It's insane.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Number 7, 2.2 billion.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Mr. Beast.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Dude Perfect, 2.3 billion views.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   He apparently throws things into things perfectly.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Dave Dobrik, I don't know, jelly, 2.5 billion.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   But that's the thing.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Pencil-mation, 2.9, at least there's animation here.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Felipe Neto, 2.8 billion.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   The number one, of course, PewDiePie.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Of course.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   4 billion views.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Of course.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   He's going to be damn president for what's up.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Well, one of the reasons I think there were so many hates on last year was he wasn't in it at all.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   That's because he was outed as like a disrespectful neo-Nazi little kid.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   There's lots of debates over that.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   He's just being a comedian and really what he's up to.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And so I won't assume he's really a neo-Nazi.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   But anyway, YouTube clearly decided this is a political hot potato.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   So we're just going to do the numbers, basically.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It totally worked too.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   This year they're only the third most disliked video of a hot video.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I forgot to show that.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   But it's like just, it's still millions of thumbs down.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   There's nothing they could have done that would have won that one.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I will say that I got home from Petaluma and I guess this had just come out.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And my daughter, it was all my daughter who is 13 now could talk about with me.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Really?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And yeah, she was like, oh, they put out the year in review.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And my husband was like, I do not even care.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I can see his body language.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   She didn't say this.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   But I am like, oh, I bet we're going to talk about this on Twig.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I should totally listen.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I'm like, well, what happened?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   So what are she saying?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I was like, I'm like, I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I'm like, I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.

[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.

[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of this.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   That's a good point.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I don't know.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   It's an interesting question.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Now, Google does their annual search trends, and that's gotten less and less interesting,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   because they break it up in so many different ways now.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   So, this is the year in Search 2019.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   I guess I'll play the video.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   I don't know what the video threw out history in times of uncertainty.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Is your audio in this?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   The world looks for heroes.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   There's audio, but it's just going to get us taken down.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It's just a dramatic score.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Just imagine dramatic sweeping music.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And you've got to pause it because they're going to go through a bunch of pictures of famous people,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   dealing with Parton and Stephen Hawking, the Dalai Lama.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   In 2019, searches for "hero sword."
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   There's Jarvis.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   There's Jarvis.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   These are superheroes in real life as well as in movies.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   These are real life superheroes.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   The one I got in there.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   People didn't really search for real life superheroes, though.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   They didn't search for people with superpowers.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   That's what fakes this up.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   These look like these are search terms.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Nobody's search is for unsung heroes.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   No, they're not searching for unsung.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Unhung heroes, maybe, but not unlikely.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Well, OK, Google is making an editorial decision here.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Just like any editor-- I mean, they're using their data to tell a story.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   But normally, this is just the numbers, man.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And then when you go to the numbers, should we do global or should we do it by country?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Let's do global.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   The number one search in 2019 was-- and this is why they changed in the video-- India versus
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Africa is probably cricket, I would guess.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Number two, Cameron Boyce.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   She died.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   OK, who is she?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I don't know.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   She died.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I'm glad I didn't know you're about the only one in India.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Koppa America-- I think that's the America's Cup, not the Child Online Protection and Privacy.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Yeah, it's a big deal, right?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Yes.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Bangladesh versus India.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Also cricket.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Is it cricket as well?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And you can click on it to see more about it if you're fascinated.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   I found 11, number five.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   How about news?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Koppa America?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   No, Tredam that burned this year.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   That was big news.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I was in tears watching that.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Cricket, again, Hurricane Dorian Rugby.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   People, Antonio Brown, football player, Neymar soccer player, James Charles.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Football?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   YouTube.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   YouTube?
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Really?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Oh, just a small hat in Kevin.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Really?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Those are controversial.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Oh, yeah, they were.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   They were controversial.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Four and five.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Kevin Hart, because of the Academy Awards last year, he was--
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   he voluntarily stepped down as--
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Not only that, but also his car accident.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   He had a car accident?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Was controversial, too.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Oh, did he cause it?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Um, more like, I believe it was more about leaving the scene.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   The car was all souped up and shouldn't have been souped up and totally not safe for driving, but they drove it anyway.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And Jesse Smallett, what's that?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Oh, that's a R. Kelly.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   That's an empire actor.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Yeah, not R. Kelly.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Not R. Kelly.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Not R. Kelly.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Not R. Kelly.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I wrote a reading before I spoke.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Okay.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   So in the actor category, it's Smallett Hart, Joaquin Phoenix, Cano Reeves, Lori Loughlin.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   All of those make sense.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Yeah, Lori Loughlin, of course, in the news because of bribing to get her kid into college athletes.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   No, no, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Just go there.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Joaquin Phoenix, what was the news there?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   He was--
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Joker.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   He was the Joker.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Joker and Keanu Reeves.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   He's just--
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   He's just a comeback.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   His comeback.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   He's just awesome.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   And the way, so three out of the five are about--
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   He's breathtaking.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Carsten said that.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   He was on stage at the Microsoft event.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   He walked on stage.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Like two seconds.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   And people swooned.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And apparently he's back, baby.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   It's also John Wick 3, I guess, right?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   John Wick, you do a little cameo in that adorable Netflix rom-com.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   What was it?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   With Ali Wong.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It was great.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Okay.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   You know what?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Be my maybe.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   I think one of the reasons people like him is because it looks like he kind of can laugh
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   at himself now.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Right.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   He is also my personal role model for our CES event, Ant and Leo's excellent CES.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   But we haven't decided who is playing the role of Keanu Reeves.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   No.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I think it's me.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   I hate to say it.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   I'm just going to walk in and go, whoa.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Yeah, you go ahead and beat that.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Athletes, Antonio Brown, Neymar, Bruce Hopper, David Ortiz, Alex Morgan.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   This is global, which is interesting to see like a baseball player in there.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Movies, Avenger, Endgame, Joker, Captain Marvel, Toy Story 4, Aquaman.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Do we learn anything from this?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   No.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Really?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   It's boring.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   That's why they made the video.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   We didn't learn anything, but maybe--
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Wait, go back to the songs.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   What was it?
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   I have some--
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Songs.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Old Town Road.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Love that song.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   I don't know, Seven Rings.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   It's the--
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Yes, it's Ariana Grande.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Ariana Grande said that was just playing.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Okay.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   That's the--
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   No idea.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Oh, get us.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Take it off.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Take it down for going.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.560]   I'm tone deaf, too.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.000]   So it's not like I'm even close to where she's--
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.640]   Shallow, which, yeah, that was the Gaga song that she did in the movie.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:34.520]   Senior Rita, Cameron, and Kamara, and Kamara, and Kamara, and Sean, and this.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   And Memories.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.520]   Memories.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520]   From Cats.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.520]   What?
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.520]   Because of the--
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.520]   Because every--
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   Because Cats is--
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.520]   On the back, baby.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.520]   Terrifying.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.520]   What?
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.520]   No, no, it's a Maroon 5--
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.520]   Is it because of the trailer?
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.520]   No, no, no, it's a Maroon 5 song.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.520]   Oh, different memories.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.520]   Sorry.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.520]   Cars is clearly not--
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.520]   Cars is clearly not--
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.520]   Cars is clearly not--
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.520]   Cars is clearly--
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.520]   No, that was memory.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.520]   Memory.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.520]   All alone in the moon, why are you--
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.520]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.520]   I think I hear dogs.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.520]   Oh!
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.520]   Okay.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.280]   Some of these shows Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, Chernobyl, When They See Us, and The
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   Umbrella Academy.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.640]   So what this shows you not is what the most popular TV show is necessarily, but some of
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.840]   the more controversial shows.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.960]   Like When They See Us was controversial, because it was about the Central Park Five,
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.680]   and I think it interests, you know, Umbrella Academy.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.240]   You know, that's funny, because that was getting a lot of press, and then I guess people
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   watched it.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.520]   I liked that show.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   Of course you did.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.520]   It's your kind of show.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.520]   It is my kind of show.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.600]   You told me to watch it.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.320]   I watched about five minutes, and I said, "I can't.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.320]   I won't."
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.920]   You asked if anybody cares.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.160]   Do you not think advertisers would care about this data and figure out some forecasting
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.160]   stuff for 2020?
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.720]   I don't think it's forecastable.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.520]   It's everything is so past.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.960]   It's all news, right?
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.760]   And to mass, to general.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.440]   Mass is dead.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.880]   That's what's wrong with this list.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.880]   This is mass.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.880]   Nobody cares about mass.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.440]   This -- Google used to do Zeitgeist, which I thought was great.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.440]   Do they still do that?
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.440]   No.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.440]   So this just replaced Zeitgeist.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.240]   Zeitgeist was the state of the world at the end of the year, and I think they attempted
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.720]   to be data scientists a little bit more and kind of extract interesting trends and stuff.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.760]   Here they're just going, "Here, this is just the list.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.920]   I'd like to see a little more, because I like data.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.960]   I don't know why I like data, but I like data."
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.520]   Well, Google likes data, too, but I think that they've been bitten by data, and they
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.360]   really don't want to look like they're editorializing in any way these days, right?
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.360]   Right.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.360]   Right.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.520]   In fact, when we started playing the video, thank you.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.400]   A little late on that.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.400]   Sorry.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.760]   If you want to be in the club, you've got to jump right on us.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.400]   It's in the latency here.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.400]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.920]   You've got to agree with Cleo very quick for Ego.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.640]   They call me the little rocket man of podcasting.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.400]   Oh, I'm sad to see this.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:03.000]   We were talking about -- you know, we did -- Stacey was here for our Twitter end show,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.520]   which will be on December 22nd.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.560]   We talked a little bit about the decade.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.800]   This was the decade of Google Glass.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.320]   We talked a little bit about it.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.240]   I guess we could say the decade ends with the end of Google Glass.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.000]   They are one more update to the Glass Explorer edition.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Oh, gee.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.640]   Let me get it out and get it updated before it is too late, because I use it so frequently,
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.640]   so worth it, was it to get it?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.840]   You are vulnerable to security threats.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.240]   Stacey, wasn't it cool that somebody --
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.880]   I'm on our team -- ran in the studio with our Google As we bought and brought it to me.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.840]   I was impressed at the number of devices from this decade that just happened to be laying
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.840]   around your studio.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.840]   Oh, yeah, we got them all.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.840]   They're all in the host office.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.040]   They paid for return.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.920]   One of them too.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.080]   So Glass Explorer edition users.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   Here's a little heads up.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.280]   You'll need to manually install the final update.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.640]   Here's how you do that.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:04.480]   You'll download a signed image file on ZipSomeFolders, run a bunch of ADB commands.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.040]   You've installed ADB on Windows, right?
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.360]   Once you've updated Glass, you'll still be able to pair the device to your phone and
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.040]   take photos, shoot videos, or use any side-loaded apps.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.720]   However, mirror apps, Gmail, YouTube, and Hangouts, will cease to function.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.720]   Bye, Bye Glass.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.440]   So I actually think this is really nice.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.240]   They're saying that we're not supporting this.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.080]   Here's exactly what you need to do.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:33.400]   Here's exactly what you can expect to happen, which a lot of companies are like, "It's
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   going to just stop working eventually."
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.800]   Or what they do with Nest.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.640]   They're like, "Yeah, if you don't update, you just won't get some features."
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.640]   So here they're like...
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.960]   Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.960]   Oh, no.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.320]   I was just going to repeat myself and say, "This is good."
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.880]   They're saying exactly what will happen.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.320]   What people do is say what they're going to say, and then they say it, and they tell
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.320]   you what they said.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.480]   Officially, you wipe in their hands of it.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.480]   We're done with it.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.480]   Exactly.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.240]   That's the Explorer edition, which was the one that we bought.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.240]   And the Enterprise edition, too, is still around.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.320]   Aren't they still doing some type of development, which is what they thought.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.920]   This is a business product for factory floors and stuff like that.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.640]   So that's not dead.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.080]   I don't think Glass has much of a future.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.920]   No, really?
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.000]   What a great interest.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.440]   You know, like, well, I've had the other future.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.440]   I'm adventurous.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.440]   Dares Leon.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.280]   On Twitter on Sunday, we had a real futurist, Amy Webb.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.760]   And we were talking about magically.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:36.680]   Maybe you saw that article in the information about how magically peasants sold more than
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   a few thousand, I think they said 6,000 of their development.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.920]   I didn't even know they were on the market.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.240]   They had a developer edition, much like Glass.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.080]   And they thought they were going to sell...
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.480]   Oh, we're going to sell...
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.400]   They said at 1.1 million, but they finally got a little more realistic and said 100,000.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.800]   And they were a little angry at this article in the information by Alex Heath, who said,
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.480]   "Dented reality, magic leap sees slow sales, steep losses."
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.640]   He says they're losing 40 million a month.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.240]   The funny thing is yesterday, so we were talking about it.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:19.440]   And by the way, I actually point out Amy Webb said, "I have been to the Florida facility.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:25.200]   I've used the beast, the big one that they showed people like Stephen Levy and Amy."
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.880]   And she said, "It's amazing."
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.680]   So what they were selling was no...
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.480]   I tried the magically one and it's just kind of like a hollow lens a little bit.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.760]   It's not that great.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.320]   But she said, "That's not what their technology is."
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.360]   So sometimes you've got to invest a lot of money and do blue sky research.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.680]   And maybe there is no way to bring it to market.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.840]   And that doesn't mean it's not valuable or it's not going to change the world.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.200]   It just means it's not ready yet.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200]   That seems reasonable.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.400]   And it sort of gives you a roadmap for further development, right?
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.240]   So I won't ding them too hard.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:08.120]   Apparently, they were very unhappy with the information's piece to the point, according
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.760]   to the information that they went to an all hands meeting and said that Alex Heath was
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.160]   a hack.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   They actually know they call them worse, an a-hole.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.080]   And the information's reporting is littered with inaccuracies and misleading statements,
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.080]   erroneously portrays magic leaps, operations, and internal plans and overall strategy.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.320]   And at the all hands meeting, they said it was clickbait and a bunch of BS.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.600]   People were looking for the next Theranos, or we work.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.640]   And that may not be unreasonable.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.880]   I mean, maybe they are losing money, Hanoverfist.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.200]   And maybe this is blue sky.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.760]   Sometimes it's, you know, we're years off.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:56.960]   So according to the article throughout 2018, the company burned 40 to $50 million a month.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.520]   But what about potential deals with the likes of Microsoft and...
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.080]   Well, you know, you know how the big investors are?
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.880]   I didn't know this and I found this out.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.120]   I was just wondering that.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   Well, Google.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.120]   Google.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   They had two...
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:18.680]   Or they had a seat on the board and Sundar Pache quietly left the board some time ago.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.720]   Sundar was on the board of directors.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.280]   Google's longtime head of mergers.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.600]   Don Harrison was a board observer.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.680]   But Sundar and Paul Jacobs, the former executive chairman of Qualcomm, quietly stepped off
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.560]   as director and observer in 2018.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:43.040]   He was... Pacheye was replaced by Jennifer Fitzpatrick, a Google senior vice president.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.240]   But investors include...
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.480]   It's an interesting list.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.480]   Saudi Arabia.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:55.200]   It's the sovereign fund, right?
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.640]   Also Mark Andreson's Andreson Horowitz.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.840]   And then who was the lead?
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.920]   I forgot looking through it.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.600]   Google Alibaba, China.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   Saudi Arabia and Andreson Horowitz.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.680]   They raised $2.6 billion.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   So I...
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.480]   While I'm a believer in augmented reality, I have to say it has not lived up with glass
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.280]   or with magically to its promise.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.280]   Still...
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.280]   But does it still just take time?
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.280]   It's just because people...
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.280]   First of all, self-driving cars...
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.480]   It's hard to augment reality.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.480]   It's hard.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.480]   Beyond that?
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.720]   You don't have to get people to even believe in it first and foremost.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   You know?
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.800]   You got demonstrated in a way that people can see.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   All right.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.800]   And again, the close thing was after that is...
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   That was a beauty.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   That was a poky man go, isn't it?
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   One of the reasons they are...
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.240]   I know it's the Hogwarts one.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.240]   Oh, God.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.440]   No, that's the first way of getting people to at least see the potential of it.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.440]   I am.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.440]   I think it's an important point.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:03.440]   I mean, that's what Cardboard did for VR for its short life of fandom.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.640]   And plus AR on the phone, you know, we want to do poky man go, you want to do stuff.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.640]   It's okay.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   You can do it.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.640]   And it's not even anything that new.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.000]   It doesn't make you say, "Oh, wow, I want this in front of me."
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.920]   So I think that the precursor to AR and the reason people like me are so excited about
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.040]   AR is science fiction.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.040]   That's really...
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.320]   And it's not to say that doesn't drive a lot of technology innovation.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.320]   A lot of...
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.400]   I think what Silicon Valley does is because they read it in a book when they were 17 or
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   16.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   They're like, "Make this happen."
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.400]   Yeah, I'm gonna be awesome.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.400]   I want those first big cars.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.920]   I want those self-driving cars.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.920]   And I think that that's...
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.000]   You know, augmented reality has a long-storyed history in science fiction.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.840]   And I think that's all you're seeing.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.840]   And the problem is when it gets down to doing it, or as you say, Jeff is self-driving cars,
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.120]   not as easy as it sounds.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.280]   Not as easy as it looked.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.280]   Yeah, I don't...
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.480]   I don't remember how we were supposed to have self-driving cars by the time we were...
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.520]   By next year.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.520]   I'm sad about that.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.360]   We were supposed to have flying cars by the time I was...
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.360]   We were supposed to have moon hotels next year.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:14.080]   Yeah, yeah, 2010, the year we make contact or whatever.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.280]   2020.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.200]   We do have flying cars, though, right?
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.200]   The quad-capped a car.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.880]   You go take a ride now.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.640]   Actually if you think about it, flying cars make no sense until you have autonomy.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.720]   There's no human can safely fly cars.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.320]   So once we have autonomy, then you can have autonomous flying cars.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.280]   So let's get autonomy done, but that's harder to do, I think.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   Well, but you're right.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.280]   But...
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.480]   But didn't Elon say we would have it this year?
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.760]   The thing about it is, because it's an empty space, you could build it from scratch, as
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.800]   opposed to cars, which you're trying to retrofit everything and figure out how to work around
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.800]   everything.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   Right.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   In the air, you could come up with a standard structure.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   Or argue about it.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.240]   It's unlikely to happen.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.840]   Well Twitter, may I go there?
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.580]   Please.
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.000]   Is trying to set a standard, right, for a distributed Twitter, which is really fascinating.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.160]   There's going to be a lot of argument about this.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.560]   This is Tweets.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:22.240]   This morning's tweet from Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, shocked the hell out of me.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:30.040]   This morning, Dorsey tweeted, "Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open-source
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.120]   architects, engineers, and designers."
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   It's very small.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.280]   But it's not too small.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.280]   No.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:41.360]   To develop and open and decentralize standard for social media.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.280]   The goal is ultimately for Twitter to be a client of this standard.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.200]   And the rationale is fascinating, because he talks about how what we really do is add
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.800]   value with algorithms.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.880]   So we want to do it with a larger pool.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.240]   You want to be the Google of Social.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   And we've been talking, we've been supporting, we've been saying it needs to be CD-centralized.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.240]   No company should have their responsibility that Facebook or Twitter has.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.240]   Though watch out.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.240]   I'm like, I'm a prick right now.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.160]   If this ever happens, and that's, you know, who knows, then there will be a hundred thousand
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.400]   social networks with a lot of crap on it, none of the controllable.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.400]   So all the effort now to try to actually centralize things and regulate the big guys, because
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.000]   they're convenience, regulate, because they're big, watch out.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.080]   Every effort to control will be.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.840]   Explain the emoji at the end of his tweet.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.840]   It's a spool of threads.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.840]   It's a thread.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.840]   It's a thread.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   It's a thread.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.840]   What follows is a thread.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   No.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.840]   It's a thread.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.840]   It's a thread.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.840]   Is that what the kids are doing now?
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.840]   If you had left Twitter, you'd know these things.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.840]   Oh, really?
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.840]   Really?
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.840]   You put a thread emoji?
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.840]   Yes.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.840]   It's a thread emoji all the time.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:52.840]   Yep.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.720]   See, and look up there, it says thread.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.720]   Thread.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.800]   Also, notice Jack's world emojis.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.440]   He's a citizen of the world in all three hemispheres.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.000]   I like that he found all three of those emojis.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   That's kind of cool.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.640]   By the way, Jack, follow me so much time.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.840]   Hi, Jack.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:19.600]   Twitter was so open early on that many saw its potential be decentralized internet standard.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.240]   I think that's, I agree with that.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:26.560]   I think we did the, in fact, I even called it internet dial tone like SMTP for a variety
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.560]   of reasons.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.560]   All reasons.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.560]   Partly.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.560]   Yes.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.760]   We took a different path and increasingly centralized Twitter, but a lot's changed over the years.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.520]   Well, Jack, yeah, you by centralized it by killing all the third party developer.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.520]   Well, he's kind of admitting that.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.520]   He's admitting it.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.360]   But he admitted that way back when he broke the third party developer network.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.120]   I mean, he admitted that that was kind of a bad idea and they wanted to go forward,
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.440]   but he realized it was kind of probably too broken and now look what he's doing.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.440]   Okay.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.680]   First, we're facing entirely new challenges.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.520]   Centralized solutions are struggling to meet.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.960]   For instance, centralized enforcement of global policy to address abuse.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.960]   This is in a way.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.000]   This is him saying, I can't, we can't pass the buck.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.720]   That's what he did with with political ads in essence is.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   I don't think it's wrong for a person to be like, this is bigger than my company.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   This is bigger than me.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.360]   I'm throwing it open to the world.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   I think it's admirable.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.360]   No, I think it's great.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.360]   It's sincere.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   It's admirable.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:26.320]   Second, the value of social media is shifting away from content hosting silos and removal
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.600]   and toward recommendation algorithms.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.520]   That is the key.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:35.920]   You think that's really, that's the, when I, when I ask people like you why you like
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.640]   Twitter, that's what you, that's what you say.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   It's, it's a way of directing my attention towards something important.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.640]   Yes.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.640]   Yes.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.640]   It does.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   Unfortunately,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.960]   these algorithms are typically proprietary and one can't choose or build alternatives
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.960]   yet.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.880]   This, if Jack is sincere here and I think he is, this is really quite impressive.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.880]   Yes.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.880]   Third is.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.880]   Then I want you to keep going.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.880]   Yes.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.320]   Third existing, this is his manifesto.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.640]   You know, this is what they call the kids call a thread.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   Right.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.320]   Third, but we, we, the old generation, there's an emoji too.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   Look at this.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   It's a spool of thread.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.320]   Okay.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.320]   I didn't know that.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.320]   Sorry.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   I didn't know that.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.400]   Well, this is your, it's your own damn fault.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.400]   Old fart.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.760]   Cause you're leaving all this stuff and bragging about, I'm not on Twitter and I'm not on Facebook
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.840]   and I'm not on planet earth.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.840]   Oh gosh.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.200]   I don't know the secret handshake for threads.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.240]   Third existing social media incentives frequently lead to attention being, by the way, you can
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:42.440]   tell it's a thread because in, when you're looking at a thread, it will say, click to read
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.080]   the thread.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.800]   So it's not that hard.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.200]   You don't need a special emoji.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.320]   Well, no, you do because sometimes the thread is just what correction or something.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.600]   This case, it's a, it's a, it's a purposeful thread.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.920]   And he's letting you know that I'm a moron.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.720]   Third existing social, please don't agree with me so fast.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.240]   Existing social media incentives frequently lead to attention being focused on content
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.280]   and conversation that sparks controversy and outrage.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.840]   Sometimes I would even say the algorithm is all about sparking outrage rather than
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   conversation.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.160]   That's my daughter who always calls on the show rather than conversation, which informs
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.320]   and promotes health.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.320]   That's going to take it.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   That's going to be a challenging one.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.160]   I'm not going to answer the phone.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.680]   Finally new technologies have emerged to make a decentralized approach more viable.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   We've tried this.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.960]   I mean, that's what status net was in canoe social and app net and pounds.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.200]   And we've been trying for this for a while.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   Blockchain.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.200]   Oh boy.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.200]   Oh, blockchain points to a series.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.440]   I'll look about five bucks of loot in the jar.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:49.160]   Oh, a series of decentralized solutions for open and durable hosting governance and even
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.800]   monetization.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.240]   Much work to be done, but the fundamentals are there.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.120]   Some of these issues were emphasized by Stephen Wolfram in a blog post filing his Senate
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.720]   hearing titled Optimizing for Engagement.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.080]   Boy, if Wolfram could solve this, anybody could understanding the use of persuasive technology
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   on internet platforms.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.720]   Did he talk about this when he was on triangulation, Carsten?
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.520]   No, he did not.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.280]   That's too bad because that's it.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   I would love to know what he thinks about all that.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.840]   Yeah, you can read his 8 million word blog post.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.320]   Yeah, if I would understand.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.920]   I mean, smart man needs an editor.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.920]   Love it.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.200]   He also says what a straight face to have you guys.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.200]   It's true.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   He's brilliant.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.480]   Dave, you just need an algorithm.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   Indeed.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.920]   He also quotes Mike Masnick, which is pretty cool.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   His article.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.080]   They keep going because I want you to.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.240]   So Dave Weiner has been screaming for this for a long time.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   I was.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.240]   He was obliged.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.240]   So he responded to Jack.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.840]   See if you can interpret his tweet because I didn't get it.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.840]   Okay.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.000]   I'm going to have to scroll.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.480]   Oh, Evan Prodromo, the creator of Status Net says hire me because Evan's been doing
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   this forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.480]   There's Dave.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.520]   Dave Weiner, I'd like to see Twitter do this in a different way.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:11.400]   You already have the bugs and scaling issues solved for a global notification network.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.200]   Let's add a few APIs and create a new universe.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.200]   I think he's right.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.760]   It'll happen a lot faster.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.360]   What's he saying that basically open Twitter as.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.480]   You don't have to open source it, but you have to, but it would be great if you open
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.480]   an API.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.640]   Yeah, there is a lot of there is.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.240]   There are a lot of people who are legitimately saying, Hey, just open up the API buddy.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.520]   So this is kind of like, let me have my business model that I've established and not have to
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:42.400]   rethink that, but have this tiny, small team, you know, sorry, Stacy.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.400]   Go ahead.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.560]   This is why I think we are, we have not gotten the thing that we all said.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.640]   We wanted and the Jack even told me that they were working on is the correction button.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.440]   Because once things are out there in the ether, you can't go back and get them back and do
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.280]   something to them.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.760]   I think not having a correction button can be defended.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.960]   I think that's a reasonable defense of that.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:09.200]   I think as long as there's a history of what you do to it, no, I think I think I think
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.280]   it encourages corrections, which would be a wonderful thing in this world.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.200]   You can correct by a subsequent tweet.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.880]   I don't work very well.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.200]   You can delete and then correct.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.400]   That's that I hate to because that's the record.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.200]   The bloggers, we hated we hated that idea.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.400]   I do it.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:32.240]   Well, you have to if you do something illiterate with whatever this effort is.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.520]   If it were to go through, I don't particularly see it fixing what he says.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:43.000]   Third, existing social media incentives frequently lead to attention being focused on content
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.280]   and conversation that sparks controversy and outrage.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.280]   It's a business problem question.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.320]   That's just society.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.080]   That's just people regardless of whatever the platform is.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.600]   Well, and if you don't, then you get masted on, which is so boring.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.600]   Where's my outrage?
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.880]   I need my cup of outrage this morning.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.880]   I don't know.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:09.680]   I mean, maybe you might have pointed out the hypocrisy of all of us by saying, no, no,
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:14.760]   we use Twitter as a signal for what's important, pointing our attentions in the right direction
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.560]   is what we're really doing is what's the latest outrage.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:23.040]   Let me if you ever keep going in Jack's thread because he also says, why is this good for
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.360]   Twitter?
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.120]   It will allow us to access and contribute to a much larger corpus of public conversation,
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.000]   focus our efforts on building open recommendation algorithms, which promote open recommendation
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.360]   algorithms, which promote healthy conversation and will force us to be far more innovative
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.360]   than in the past.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.360]   But it will also be possible that you can, if it's an open world, you can build the anti
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.520]   Jack.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:49.200]   You can build the, I'm going to find every bit of outrage in the world and clon it all
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.200]   together, right?
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.200]   And this is open.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.600]   Yeah, you could have bright like this.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.600]   I like this.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.040]   Yeah, you could also have MSNBC Twitter and you could have.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:04.120]   I don't want to sound so much like a simple ten or anything, but would this limit me from
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:08.240]   putting in mute words such as impeachment and stuff like that?
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.960]   No, of course, you know, the API is that's what happens when I open up Twitter.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.200]   I'm fed all kinds of things that I have no interest in.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.640]   Mr. Jarvis said it, hey, it works for him.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.200]   Whatever it pops up is the things that he's interested in.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.480]   I don't see that anymore.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:30.080]   I think all of us in self-defensive developed various behaviors to protect us from the Twitter
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.920]   outrage machine because you have to.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:38.400]   And there are certainly a ways to do this, but presumably an open standard might have
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.080]   more ways to do that or have a variety of ways or, you know, I mean, one of the things
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:47.560]   honestly, I guess a legitimate question is how is this different than say Mastodon, which
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:52.280]   is a federated open source Twitter clone?
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.120]   The idea would be that maybe you could bring it.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.240]   Maybe it's a little bit more professional.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.080]   Maybe you don't have to all be on the same server.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.080]   No, you don't.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   With that's what the beauty of Mastodon.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.200]   Oh, I thought you always had to be on the same server.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.840]   What am I thinking of?
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:06.840]   I don't know.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.840]   I'm not the right space.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.840]   You're thinking of the other way.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:14.040]   The entire point of Mastodon is that you can create many, many Mastodon servers and it's
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.540]   federated.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.040]   And if you wish, you could follow somebody on another server.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.520]   They can follow you on another server.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.360]   So they call them toots.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.800]   Your toot can go to different Mastodon servers.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.760]   Mastodon is great.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:34.800]   But Mastodon has everything you would want in this kind of tool except the network effect,
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.520]   except the massive users.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:42.000]   And this is the problem you're going to face with this open and decentralized standard.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.240]   I think Dave Weiner is right if you just make an API.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.680]   But then Twitter loses completely control of its own control.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.040]   So what Jack, I think Jack's thought.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.680]   Well, okay, but hold on there.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.680]   So let me play with that for a second.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:59.680]   So then you go to the WordPress model, right, which is the WordPress, the code base is open
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.680]   source.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.960]   WordPress is the first company to build on top of it.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:08.600]   Others can build too, but that gets them a third of the web.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:14.320]   Twitter could shift to that model where it makes its code base basically open source,
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.400]   but then it builds that value add on top.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.640]   Which is what he's saying.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:24.240]   Okay, there's all this chatter out there, including this Twitter old, we're going to
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.360]   build value on top of that.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:33.000]   Well, but WordPress, a lot of the value from WordPress comes from, there's the WordPress
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.280]   hosting business.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:39.840]   And there's also the people who build on WordPress businesses for like various.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.840]   Like it's.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.840]   Thank you.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.800]   I was like, what is the word for those things?
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.120]   Well, Stacy, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.120]   Yes.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:54.240]   So the code, so you benefit from the open source contributions to the code base, right?
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.680]   But you can build your proprietary thing on top, which is exactly what we're pressed
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.680]   in.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:05.400]   So then the question is, would I be willing to buy tweet deck?
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:10.960]   What is the, what is the revenue share between Twitter and like the new version of tweet
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.480]   deck that they have access to?
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.760]   This can be an older model.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:22.040]   You were subscribed to Twitter's smart person recommendation engine and Twitter goes to some
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.720]   effort to find experts.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.840]   Sameer, remember Sameer, he's working on a really fascinating thing that starts building
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.840]   expert networks.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.320]   Very, very potentially there.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.240]   And he hasn't really talked about it too much openly.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.400]   But, but, but, and Jack's talked about this.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.640]   And what I met with Jack last time, he talked about trying to get to experts.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.320]   So he's been thinking about this.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:52.320]   So I subscribed to the media walk network and, and Twitter has to go to some effort to vet
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.680]   people and do other things they add value to it.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   What is that?
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.880]   What is that definition of value add?
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:08.000]   Or Leo sponsors the podcast geniuses network.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.480]   And you can get that.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:16.720]   And so it's not just everybody that it becomes the, what's the bad of this side?
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.920]   The bad is does Black Lives Matter happen in that world?
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.120]   Do things bubble up in a way that by virality is presented as bad?
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   Yeah, that's not the bad.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.640]   But virality is not the bad thing.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.640]   Black Lives Matter does happen.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.320]   What it had, what doesn't necessarily happen is as you say, it doesn't bubble up with that.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.320]   Nobody sees that.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.320]   It might depend.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:42.520]   So subscribe to, if you subscribe to social activists or whatever causes, then you should
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.520]   start seeing it.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.840]   And maybe that leads to a place where journalists become useful again.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.520]   But the point of, yes, Stacy, that's right.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:57.880]   But living while Black, the hashtag, I wouldn't have seen it.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.840]   The fact that it was presented to me through this network was where the value really was.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.800]   I said, oh crap, that happens.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.960]   Is it trending that presents those to you?
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.280]   Is that how you learn about it?
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.400]   No, it's because a friend of a friend or a friend sees it and eventually it gets to
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.400]   me.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.400]   Well, that could happen.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.720]   I think on a decent decentralized network.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.720]   That's not it.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:26.840]   So Stacy, as a B2B person in your business, could you imagine a high value ad business
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.680]   social network?
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   Like LinkedIn?
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   Sorry.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.560]   On Twitter?
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.160]   I guess that's what I already have.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   So sure.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.160]   I can.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.960]   I mean, I don't follow.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.120]   I follow people who are in my industry.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.000]   So I don't follow like my friends.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.760]   I guess my basic issue with this is it feels like Jack has jumped on a bandwagon that
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.440]   I've been writing for decades, almost as long as Twitter has been around.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:03.400]   And we've seen every one of these decentralized solutions kind of.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.960]   Not fail.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.800]   Failing is a strong word, but kind of peer out.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.200]   They just don't get the momentum.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   And I join them all.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.400]   There's a new one I want to join.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.680]   I read about in this thread called Scuttlebutt.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.080]   I want to try that one as well.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.360]   But another decentralized social platform, you know.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.280]   But I feel like what happens is because everybody's on Twitter and Facebook.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   That's where people go.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.280]   That's where you go.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.840]   You've got the critical mass.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   Is it?
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.800]   There's something there's always something around the corner trying to be the next Twitter
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.040]   or the next Facebook.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.960]   But nothing is proven to.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:44.680]   We always use the canonical example of Facebook taking over from MySpace and say, well, let's
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.400]   see it could happen then.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.800]   But I think these guys have gotten so big in the credit.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.440]   They've reached so much of the potential audience at this point that it's virtually
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:57.280]   possible at this point for somebody to come along and say, we're going to beat Facebook
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.840]   at its own game or we're going to be Twitter at its own game.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:06.300]   What about something like Twitch or Discord which do have, they're making their way out
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.720]   of the gaming arena.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:14.040]   I mean, is that that might be where we're seeing the next Facebook and Twitter and what
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.240]   next wave of social media happen?
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.240]   Because that's what's going to happen.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.560]   I don't think it'll be a duplicate platform.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.360]   I think it will be a different and a unique way.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.760]   I mean, I've even said maybe Fortnite is the next social network.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.840]   It certainly is for a certain group of people.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.640]   So it won't look like Twitter or Facebook.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.840]   It'll look like something different.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   This is interesting.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:40.920]   If you go to Fred Wilson's Twitter feed who was a board member of Twitter for quite a
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:44.600]   while, he's very pleased at what Jack is doing.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.000]   He wrote about his feelings on this three and a half years ago.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.600]   The idea of turning Twitter into a protocol and allowing an entire ecosystem of applications
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:56.600]   to flourish on top of it is breathtaking and its ambition and importance for all the reasons
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.000]   Jack outlines his tweets for him.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   So he's...
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.640]   And one of the things is that Biz pops in.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.640]   Oh, Biz is in there.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.640]   Oh, I do see that.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.640]   Oh, he says, "Thanks, Fred."
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.640]   We won't...
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   We...
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.640]   He's speaking first-person plural.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   We won't control it.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:16.400]   It will be free, open protocol like SMTP.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.280]   Dave Weiner, nice to hear from you, Biz.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.840]   I've been hitting a different wall with Twitter.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.880]   I want to cross post and I can't because there is so little overlap between what services
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.480]   are willing to accept.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.480]   This is also Interop, which is a more immediate opportunity.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.480]   Hi, Dave.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   Says Biz.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.480]   It's been a long time.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   Oh, my God.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.480]   It's like all the old gags coming together.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.400]   Oh, it's time for water con.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   I'm just gonna...
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.280]   I'm gonna join the thread and said, "I had pizza for lunch."
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.280]   Do it.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   Just, you know.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.680]   Just to really bring it back to the good old days.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.080]   Interesting.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.400]   So I'm...
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.680]   You know, I'll watch with interest.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   I applaud this.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.280]   I think Jack's thought about it and sees...
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.880]   Honestly, it feels a little bit like Jack's looking for a way out.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.440]   Just like Larry and Sergey looked for a way out last week.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.440]   Gracefully.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:16.360]   Yeah, because it's getting ugly and I don't have high hopes for it because I feel like
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.240]   we've seen this before.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.240]   We've...
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.800]   And it never seems to make a difference.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:30.200]   And honestly, besides us, are people looking for what's the next Twitter or the next Facebook?
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.560]   I don't think people are looking.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.560]   No, of course not.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   Why would...
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.560]   You find things that are more interesting or serve your needs.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.520]   And sometimes you don't even drop the other ones.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.520]   Right.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.520]   Look at TikTok.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.520]   I was like TikTok.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.200]   Nobody was really looking for it.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.920]   People were still checking it out, but they're not leaving everything else.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:52.000]   I had a long conversation with Alex Lindsey at our Christmas party.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.440]   Alex's convinced TikTok is the next big thing, bigger than Facebook, bigger than Twitter.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.960]   It's going to be huge.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:03.440]   And I spent some time with it because I wanted to honor his opinion.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.440]   Right.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.120]   And it is my considerate conclusion that it will be a...
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:10.120]   It's another flash in the panel, be gone in a year or two.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.920]   It is not going anywhere.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.520]   What's interesting is the first effort for a Chinese company to leave China.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.520]   Wow!
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:24.160]   There's a guy flying on a broom on TikTok.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.840]   I hear the Harry Potter theme that guarantees a TikTok.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:35.040]   I erased it because it is so such an assault on your sensibilities.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.040]   And it's for people...
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.000]   I know why Alex loves it because he's short attention span.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   He loves...
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   It's quick.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   It's fast.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.560]   I have no problem with that.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.440]   That's what Instagram stories can be too.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.840]   It's worse than Instagram stories.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.480]   It's just quick dopey hits.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.200]   And it's fine.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   It's entertaining, roughly entertaining.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.360]   Well, that's what social networks are entertainment.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.360]   Yep.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.160]   It's got no staying power.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.200]   I think TikTok is another flash in the panel.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.360]   We've seen a lot of...
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.760]   I don't think he has any staying power.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:14.160]   I think it's not a Facebook or a Twitter, but it's a new vine.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.160]   It's not even a Snapchat.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:21.440]   It's just a new way of writing some new ways for people to share things.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.440]   Spacey.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.280]   I was going to say, I think it's actually...
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:29.320]   Maybe I don't think it's a social network, but I do think it's a very valuable form of
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.840]   entertainment for young people today.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:37.600]   And it's how they're telling their stories and communicating who they are.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.320]   And I wouldn't discount that.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.320]   They may mean a lot.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.120]   I think musically was.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:49.640]   I think now that the ante is so high on TikTok that it's too much work for people.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.400]   What's going to happen is what happens with all of these networks.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.400]   You're already seeing it.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.160]   The big names, the brands are coming in.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.960]   They're going to spend lots of money making elaborate TikToks.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.040]   A few big TikTok stars will emerge as they did an unvine.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.760]   And they're going to put a lot of work into it.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:09.960]   We were just looking at the unboxing videos by the three top Mac YouTube people using
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.720]   berries and reds, three red cameras.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:18.240]   And it just deals out your daughter completely.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.400]   And at some point she's going to say, I can't participate.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.600]   It's an entertainment medium.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.600]   And then it's over.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   Yes and no.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.680]   Because she shares things with her friends and she follows friends.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.920]   And she does not want to be a TikTok star.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.920]   And I know there's lots of...
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.880]   So she's in it for the fun and for the creativity.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.680]   And there's nothing saying that she can't do that.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:51.400]   And if her goal isn't to become the next whatever, I still think that's valuable.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.280]   Oh, it's not a communication medium.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.760]   It's an entertainment medium.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.760]   And honestly, what's going to...
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.760]   I want to try it.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.760]   It's the same.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   Yeah, you try.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.760]   I'd love to get...
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.360]   And do the hardheads use it?
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.360]   No.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.360]   No.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.360]   You don't let them.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.360]   No.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.520]   They're free to use whatever they want.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.840]   Most of the time they're using Snapchat or Instagram.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   But the thing is...
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.480]   And your daughter uses Instagram, right?
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.880]   She's on it, but she doesn't use it.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.400]   I don't think the boy is an interest.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:25.080]   Now Queen Pruitt is interested because her friends are watching things on it, but it's
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.440]   just like what Ms. Stacey said.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.440]   It's an entertainment thing.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.440]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.920]   They're not creating any content.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.520]   They're just consuming it.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.240]   But it's short attention span stuff.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:42.680]   I'd hollie in our chat room says TikTok is amazingly fun and great for artistic people,
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:47.920]   but the main reason it'll hang around is because they've proved they can adapt and change.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.840]   I love the unique style of creativity there.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   I hope it hangs around.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.520]   It is very much like Vine to me.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.800]   That's the only thing that comes to my mind is it's just like Vine, which I had no interest
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   in.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.680]   Twitter bought it and put it out of business.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   Let's take a break.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:07.920]   Back with much more Stacey Higginbothamstacey on IOT.com.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.480]   Mr. Ant Pruitt from Hands on Photography.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.720]   Hands on Focus on Photography.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.240]   Hands on the Focus.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.120]   Hands off your Focus and all the other great shows.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.360]   And TikTok for five minutes.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.360]   TikTok.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.960]   We're going to do the TikTok show.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:28.240]   We actually, I'm embarrassed to have been created at TikTok channel for Twit last week.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.240]   Oh, I know.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.240]   I was told.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.240]   I'm interested in this.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.240]   You're on TikTok now.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.240]   I said, huh?
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.240]   I brought you a side.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.320]   We have the best social network, social media people, Masako and Jerry do a great job.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.680]   Masako's always going around with a camera tape.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.880]   Anytime anything happens around here, there's, I feel like we have Pop in-house Pop in-house.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.920]   You have to be- I'll just say you have to be careful with Ms. Masako.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.920]   You never know.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.680]   Just recording it all.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.560]   And Mr. Jeff Jarvis, who is teaching us the future about the future of journalism.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:05.520]   Our show today brought to you by worldwide technology, the future of enterprise technology.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.640]   Worldwide technology has been around for a long time, about a decade.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.160]   And I'll tell you what, once you become a customer of worldwide tech, and I know many,
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:17.400]   many, many enterprises do, they, you just never stop because they provide the kind of
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.080]   service and support you're looking for.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:25.160]   And a lot of that is because of their ATC, their Advanced Technology Center.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.840]   They started building this 10 years ago.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.720]   It's grown like Topsy.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:33.600]   More than half a billion dollars in equipment in the ATC.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.880]   And it's for testing, it's for research.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:42.040]   Their engineers use it to spin up proofs of concept and pilots to test products before
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:49.880]   they show them to you, to create a sandbox so that you can look and choose the perfect
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.160]   solution for you.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.280]   But here's the beauty part.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.680]   The ATC is also open to their customers.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.520]   They offer something they call lab as a service.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:04.880]   It's a dedicated lab space within the ATC where you can perform programmatic testing on that
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:10.000]   vast technology ecosystem that WWT has already built.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.680]   It's, it's, it's such a, and you can do it by the way virtually.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.120]   See there's the Taney Improving Ground Lab.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:23.520]   So if you're looking at Taney for your business, you want to understand more, you can go in
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:27.000]   here, you can set it up, you can play with it, you can create pilots.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.760]   You can really bang on it.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.600]   It's a, it's, it's available 24/7 wherever you are in the world.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.040]   You don't have to go to St. Louis to use it.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.680]   It's available anywhere.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   It's amazing.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:44.520]   This ecosystem creates a multiplier effect, a knowledge, speed, and agility anytime, anywhere
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.960]   around the world for customers, not just the labs, the hands-on labs, with case studies,
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:55.200]   articles, all the tools you need to understand enterprise technology before you buy it, before
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.200]   you use it.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:00.080]   But after you buy it, to understand it better, it's just amazing.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.600]   WWT is a trusted partner who stays with you over the years and you're going to want to
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:05.600]   know more.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.440]   So I know how, I know how you can find out more.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.440]   I do.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:15.520]   Go to www.t.com/twit and create an account and join the ATC ecosystem.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:22.280]   WWT simplifies the complex at www.t.com/twit.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:26.120]   That's why technology, delivering business and technology outcomes around the world.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.960]   We're going to be again going out and visit them in the spring.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.640]   I'm excited we're going to do a show out there.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.560]   Details to follow.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.760]   Thank you, WWT for supporting the show.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:44.960]   So Tim Sweeney of Epic is in a battle with Google.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:51.960]   Epic, remember, very famously, did not want to put its Fortnite, the hottest game of the
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:59.840]   last few years in the store, in the Play Store because they want a 30% cut.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.560]   But the problem is, if you're not in the Play Store, it's hard for people to get it.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.560]   It's risky to get it.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:10.960]   So Epic went to them and said, "Look, we would like to put Fortnite in the Play Store, but
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.440]   we don't want to give you your 30% of in-app purchases.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.560]   It's a free app, but they make billions."
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.760]   Tim Sweeney made it $7 billion last year on in-app purchases in Fortnite.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.160]   Do they have a similar deal with Apple?
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.080]   Are they just like, "Well, Apple, you're so amazing."
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.080]   I don't think so.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.480]   The thing is Apple, you got no choice.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.480]   There's no sign loading.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:29.480]   Right.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.480]   You have a choice on Android, right?
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.480]   Exactly.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:32.480]   Exactly.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:37.640]   Honestly, and I think there is, as I remember a case going to the Supreme Court about Apple's
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.640]   monopoly.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.680]   Honestly, Apple has a monopoly on apps you could put on the iPhone, but Google does not.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.160]   Did you see the information?
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:50.640]   Jessica Lesson did a story about getting their app approved by the Apple Store.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:56.440]   It was designed to rile people, but it talked about the approval process in-depth and-
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.000]   It used to be pretty painful back in the days.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   I just- Oh, I think it is.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   It's still painful.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   I think it is.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   I think it's more painful.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   But people are willing to do it because- I balls.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.800]   I have to.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:14.800]   If you want to be on the iPhone, and in the US anyway, the iPhone is very, very dominant.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.800]   No, I didn't.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:19.880]   Inside our app store or deal, I love Jessica Lesson.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:20.880]   She's been on our shows.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.880]   She's great.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.280]   It all started with the price.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.240]   Peter Schulz, who leads their product and engineering teams, walked into my office and
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:30.760]   told me, "We couldn't charge what we had planned to for our upcoming news app because
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.040]   you have to follow Apple's own tiers."
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.040]   Oh.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.040]   And I don't mean T-E-A-R-S.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.040]   Oh.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.880]   I mean T-I-E-R-S.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:44.520]   They wanted $30 a year, but that's not in the Apple tier.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.560]   It goes on to talk about things like the way they advertised was too over the top.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.560]   It talks about-
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.600]   They rejected the app four times.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:59.360]   Yeah, they rejected it because they had some of the stories they ran in the app were on
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.920]   the free site, so they changed the way that worked.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.840]   They had to change the way a lot of things worked.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.760]   Now I'm a subscriber, so I already have the information.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.640]   And I put the name of the app, by the way, is great.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.280]   TechTop10.
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.000]   And it's actually very useful.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   What's their number one story?
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.160]   Alex Heath's story about Twitter bidding to build a decentralized social network.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.880]   They do really great work.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.840]   In fact, they've gotten better year after year after year.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:31.960]   But what I love about the information and Jessica is they don't mind speaking truth
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.640]   to power.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.920]   And it's a risky thing.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:39.320]   You don't see a lot of developers complaining about Apple's process too publicly.
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.320]   No, because they know that it's-
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:42.880]   A lot of power there.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.600]   Butter in their bread, essentially.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:53.440]   But I don't get about this thing with Epic, it takes a lot of co-honest to come up to someone
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.200]   and say, "Hey, I want to use your platform, but I want to use it on my terms."
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:03.680]   I know you can give me more and more eyeballs and get more people access to my game, but
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.040]   I want to do this on my own terms.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:11.120]   They're making the calculated decision to do this based on the fact that they think demand
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.400]   is higher than in Google won't say no.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.920]   They just think they're the ones in power in this play, in this situation.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.440]   We talked about it briefly on all about Android last night.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:25.160]   And I wonder, because I don't have data in front of me or anything, but I wonder, is Epic
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.640]   sitting at a point of plateau right now far as growth?
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.640]   Maybe that's why they want to be in the store.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   Right.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.240]   So what prompted them to say, "Hey, you know what?
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:40.000]   We need to give Android a try and we need to give the Google way of doing it a try."
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.720]   But we still want to leverage our strength of, "Hey, we are Epic in Fortnite."
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:47.200]   Here's Epic's statement that they gave to the Verge.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.920]   "Epic doesn't seek a special exemption for ourselves."
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:51.920]   RAVAS.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:58.000]   We expect to see a general change in smartphone industry practices in this regard.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Okay, good luck.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.160]   Well, with that statement, it's okay.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:04.040]   You're trying to pioneer something for the people behind you.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.040]   Great.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.360]   But still, you're going into an ecosystem.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:13.760]   So I think, like in white, the threat here though is a threat of litigation.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:19.840]   We believe this form of tying of a mandatory payment service with a 30% fee is illegal in
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:24.960]   the case of a distribution platform with over 50% market share.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:30.400]   So I think that's essentially saying, "You got to let us in because otherwise we're going
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.400]   to sue."
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.120]   And Google said, "Okay, we'll meet you in court on Tuesday."
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   Google said that.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:42.320]   And by the way, Jessica Lesson's story says the biggest problem.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.680]   As you pointed out, Stacey with the App Store, the biggest problem they had.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:51.600]   If we want to launch, we had to disable a part of the app that allowed users to preview
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.960]   information articles and subscribe to read them.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:58:00.400]   The reason is, of course, that information subscription doesn't go through the App Store.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.200]   And Apple wants that 30%.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.640]   And so this is a problem.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:13.680]   Honestly, we've gone back and forth about this on all of our Mac shows since the day it started
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.560]   for years.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:20.120]   And on the one hand, developers, if you do it yourself, you have to provide bandwidth
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.720]   to store your app, which is expensive.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.520]   You have to promote it, which is expensive.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.520]   You have all sorts of issues.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.760]   You go into the App Store.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:29.760]   Apple takes 30%.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.680]   But before that, you get storage bandwidth promotion.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.000]   They handle the transactions in the background.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.620]   All the headache is gone.
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:45.560]   And so I think honestly, a lot of developers say that's not the problem, the 30%.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:53.160]   The kind of unknown quantity that getting approval is a problem because you get rejected
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.160]   for weird reasons.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.160]   You don't understand the reason.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.160]   You don't understand the reason.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:04.800]   And sometimes Apple seems like they enforce it in unevenly and so forth.
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:12.020]   She points out, I tried to download an audiobook from Audible on my iPhone and was told why
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:13.020]   I couldn't.
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:18.860]   I always hated this because Audible and no Amazon subscriptions are allowed.
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:21.980]   Amazon won't allow that because they don't want to give 30%.
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.740]   There are a lot of subscriptions, though, on iPhone that go through Apple.
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:29.740]   In fact, it's a great convenience for the user because it uses Apple Pay.
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:33.260]   You just double click and you recognize your face is very fast.
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:37.120]   In fact, I think that's really the secret sauce and a lot of Instagram ads these days
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:43.800]   is it's so easy to pay that you're likely in a befuddled half a sleep state to buy underwear
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:48.040]   if you will never buy and heat it underwear and colorful hair.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.040]   Sounds like the voice of experience.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.040]   Heated underwear?
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.040]   What?
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:55.240]   It's a long, painful story.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.240]   Long story.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.240]   You didn't really.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.240]   You.
[00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.240]   It wasn't me.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240]   Wasn't me.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:08.060]   Sounds like a story from the Christmas party late enough.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.420]   Yeah, I missed this story.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.420]   Anyway, the good news.
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:12.420]   I'm okay with that.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.420]   The information did get in.
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:17.460]   The bad news, Tim Sweeney lost.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:22.180]   He's not happy about either the Apple or the Google Vig, the 30%.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:28.860]   He says it's grossly out of proportion with the cost of services that two companies provide.
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:35.100]   Mac has its own store, by the way, and when Epic takes their cut, they take an 11 and
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.100]   a half percent cut.
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.100]   They don't take 30%.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.340]   Well, that's their prerogative.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.340]   Right.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.980]   Well, we'll see.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:49.640]   I suspect we're going to see this is a big company pushing back and they have deep pockets
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.380]   and I can see them saying that we ought to take this to court.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.380]   Go on the court.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.820]   This is one we'd like to get a record.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.940]   I'll get my popcorn ready for that.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:58.940]   I'm kind of with them.
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:00:59.940]   I don't know.
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:03.980]   You know, the other thing that Apple provides from the end user's point of view is the security
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:07.820]   because they check the app carefully for security flaws.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:12.100]   Well, at least in theory, it seems like they're more interested in the color of the font.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:17.620]   But in theory, you're more secure in an curated app store like that.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.380]   Think about it again with a simpleton mine.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.380]   Oh, hello.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.380]   I hate you, Cyril.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.380]   Oh, CRY.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:29.820]   Think about it from a simpleton standpoint.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:37.020]   Let's look at, say, a barber wanting to get started in business and they go to a particular
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:40.100]   venue and get charged booth rent.
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.820]   They paid at booth rent because they know, hey, I can get foot traffic here.
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:47.140]   I'm going to have a lot of my facilities taken care of right here.
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:50.380]   I don't have to worry about all that extra overhead and so forth.
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:55.660]   I can make up that 30% with the extra foot traffic that I get each and every week.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.580]   You know, what's the difference here?
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.620]   None of this seems unfair in my opinion.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:01.620]   Right.
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:06.180]   Epic is just, again, getting a little bit too big here.
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.380]   Let it go, dude.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:14.100]   Well, there are other, like, what if there's only two salons in town and so you've got
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.820]   to go with one or the other?
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.540]   That's more apt.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:18.540]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:25.820]   And there is a case to be made that maybe with economies of scale, so the longer they
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:32.540]   do this, the better they get at it shouldn't they bring the pricing down to something more
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:38.060]   reasonable because there's no, I mean, Google set 30% because Apple set 30%.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.060]   That's true.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.060]   Okay.
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:43.380]   So that's the point of monopolies that you establish a monopoly, then you don't have
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.380]   to bring the prices down.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:45.940]   You could set it to whatever you want.
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:51.540]   If that said, then Epic could just stay in their own lane and instead of charging 11%,
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.540]   make it 15%.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.260]   Why not do that?
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.580]   Because they can't get on the Google app.
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:01.780]   Oh, no, no, no, I'm saying Epic just continue to do what they're doing now.
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.780]   They did and they charge 11 and a half percent.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.380]   Instead of charging 11 and a half, make it 15%.
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.180]   Well, but they don't want to.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.420]   They want to, that's what they use as an example of how they are.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:15.780]   They clearly want some more downloads and some more cash if they're trying to get, get
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:16.780]   into it.
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:17.780]   They may not.
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:24.660]   They may just be trying to meet the demand for Fortnite on Android devices.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:25.660]   It's a bet.
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:26.660]   Look, it's a better experience.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:27.660]   We've even said this.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:32.980]   The first time they were started to offer a Fortnite for a sideload, there was malware.
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:33.980]   Right.
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:37.100]   So it's a much better experience for the user if it's in the play store.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.980]   Everybody knows that and that's the leverage Google has and that's absolutely the leverage
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:41.980]   Apple has.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.060]   There's no other choice.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:48.020]   So at least Google gives you a checkbox and you could say, "I want a sideload."
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:50.820]   Apple by the way is moving in that direction, I think, on Mac OS.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:55.500]   I think that's the other point of this a little bit might be the subtext of this might be
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.100]   to threaten Apple and Microsoft.
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:02.300]   This isn't working on the store, on the mobile and it really won't work on desktop because
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.820]   Epic has a desktop app.
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.700]   They would be really upset.
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:15.060]   I remember when the Windows Play Store started Gabe Newell, Steam was very upset and said,
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.540]   "They're trying to kill Steam.
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:23.220]   They want all app purchases, all game purchases to go through them and Microsoft take its percentage."
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.580]   And that's the fear, I think, of people like Sweeney and Newell's.
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.740]   They've got their own fiefdoms.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.540]   They don't want to have to pay these Vigs.
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:30.700]   And I don't blame them.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.860]   I don't blame them.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.980]   And I don't know if it's good for consumers or not.
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:36.940]   That's another, that's a more complicated issue.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.940]   Let's take a break.
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:38.940]   I want to do a change log.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:40.980]   And it's a big change log.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:41.980]   I even added some stuff to it.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:44.260]   It's a massive change log.
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:47.020]   It is the biggest change log we've ever had.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:50.140]   In fact, I think this is pretty exciting.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.860]   There's some good stuff in here, but stay tuned.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:56.500]   We're going to first mention our sponsor ExpressVPN.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:02.300]   By now, anybody who watches our shows knows that a VPN is the only safe way to sit on
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.620]   an open Wi-Fi access point.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:09.900]   I think a lot of our listeners use ExpressVPN even at home because it doesn't slow you down.
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.900]   That's one of the amazing things about ExpressVPN.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:17.100]   And it does keep your ISP or your carrier from snooping on what you're doing.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:22.860]   It stops that hacker in the open Wi-Fi coffee shop from seeing what you're up to.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:25.340]   So all of those things, privacy and security.
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.300]   But there's also an advantage to ExpressVPN.
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.300]   That's pretty cool.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.940]   You can help you take your TV watching to the next level.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.940]   You can do it.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:37.100]   Well, one of the locking movies and shows that are only available in other countries.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.900]   See, when you use ExpressVPN, you get to choose the default.
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:45.940]   The simple one-click default is to go to the nearest VPN server to you.
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:49.300]   But you can choose any of 100 countries.
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:53.580]   And that means you can go to those countries and watch, for instance, Netflix in that country.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.060]   Want to binge a doctor who or Star Trek?
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:06:00.540]   You can't watch it in Netflix US, but you can in Netflix UK.
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:06.900]   You can change your locale to England or the United Kingdom and refresh Netflix.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.740]   And suddenly you've got all the shows.
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:15.300]   ExpressVPN hides your IP address and lets you control where you want sites to think
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.820]   you're located.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:21.180]   Think about all the Netflix libraries you can go through.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:25.820]   If you love anime, use ExpressVPN to access Japanese Netflix.
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:26.820]   It's not just Netflix.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:32.460]   The way there's a list on the website, but Hulu, BBC's iPlayer, YouTube, I can go on
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.460]   and on.
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:38.300]   A lot of streaming sites are suddenly open to you with ExpressVPN.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:41.540]   By the way, to be clear, this is not illegal.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:45.940]   In fact, I even asked Netflix, "What's the deal?"
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.980]   And they said, "Well, we tell people we don't want you to use a VPN because it's going to
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:49.980]   be a bad experience.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:54.220]   It's going to be too slow, but we don't, honestly, if you want to use it, go ahead.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.780]   We won't stop you."
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:07:00.460]   And with ExpressVPN, it's so fast that, in fact, I left it on.
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:05.220]   I was demonstrating it yesterday during iOS today, and I forgot to turn it off.
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.460]   I downloaded the iOS 13 update.
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.220]   I didn't watch TV news.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:14.820]   I was doing all this stuff with ExpressVPN running until I realized, "Wait a minute.
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.420]   I'm on Tokyo time."
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:19.180]   Oh, I left it on.
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.100]   That's how fast it is.
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:22.180]   I love ExpressVPN.
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:23.740]   There's never any buffering or lag.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.300]   You can stream in HD, no problem.
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.220]   It works everywhere you want to be.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:35.100]   Of course, Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS, but also Linux, also media consoles, smart
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.380]   TVs and more.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:41.020]   Yes, you can watch what you want on the go or even on the big screen.
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.740]   We love ExpressVPN.
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:44.660]   Privacy, absolutely.
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:48.940]   They're reviewed by an independent third party auditor just the other day, and they
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.140]   said, "Yep, it does exactly.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:51.860]   Privacy policy, exactly what they do.
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.860]   They do not log."
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:58.580]   In fact, the trusted server technology ExpressVPN uses absolutely prevents the server from
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.580]   running to the hard drive.
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.180]   There's no way to log.
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.420]   Every time you log in, you get a nice fresh new server.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:08.900]   You don't ever have to worry about what you're doing being tracked by ExpressVPN or anybody
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:10.500]   else for that matter.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.980]   Right now, you get a great deal, three extra months free when you subscribe for a year
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:20.340]   at ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:23.220]   Three extra months with a one year package, that is the absolute best deal.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.780]   Get it down below $7 a month.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:26.780]   Support our show.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:27.780]   Watch what you want.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:29.580]   Protect yourself at ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.940]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:37.300]   I thank you for supporting us, not only by being an ExpressVPN customer, but by using
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:39.780]   that special address that way they know.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:44.060]   Oh, they watch ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.060]   Now get ready.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:50.300]   I wanted to start the change log early today because it's going to take a couple hours.
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.780]   It's time for the Google change log.
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:55.700]   Hit the button, Karsten.
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.980]   The Google change log.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.020]   Wow.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.220]   Where do we start?
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:07.660]   I'm going to tell you my favorite thing as a Pixel user.
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:11.940]   Google has announced, I think this is really interesting, that they're going to start updating
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:16.780]   the Pixel monthly with features.
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:19.620]   And this is smart because, you know, the Pixel 4 got a lot of negative.
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.540]   I think unfortunate negative reviews.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.820]   I don't think deserve negative reviews.
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:29.980]   This will make the Pixel 4 and all Pixel phones more desirable.
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:36.780]   The new update which is being pushed in December lets you blur backgrounds after you take the
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:37.780]   picture.
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:42.980]   Even pictures you took years ago, if you forgot to turn on portrait mode, you can use portrait
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:43.980]   mode.
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:45.460]   This clearly is a...
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.460]   Isn't that demo?
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:48.420]   Isn't that entire photo blurry?
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:49.420]   I don't know.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.940]   I haven't got it yet.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:53.500]   So I can't tell you if it works.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.500]   I don't need it.
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.500]   I look forward to trying it.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.420]   I got it and it does work.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:57.420]   It figures out which...
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.420]   That's pretty sophisticated.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:01.900]   Which are your photos are portraits.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:05.420]   And instead of the pop slider, you get a blur slider.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:06.420]   Oh nice.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.340]   Oh yes, yes, I have this too.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.340]   It is neat.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:10.340]   How do you get it?
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.340]   How do you get it?
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.340]   Because you got the December update.
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.740]   Well, you have the update, right?
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.740]   Well, no, I actually...
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:17.380]   So I had a little light bulb notification that I had never seen before.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.700]   It was either yesterday or the day before and I touched it and it was like, "Hi, we've
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:25.340]   updated your phone with recorder, this blur thing and one other thing."
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.340]   Oh, yeah, by the way.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:27.340]   I was like, "Thanks Google."
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:31.580]   Because we were talking, I was showing off on the Pixel 4 this really great recorder,
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:32.580]   which does transcription.
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:34.980]   "You asked Jeff, can I use it on my 3A?"
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:35.980]   Yes, you can.
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:36.980]   It's right now.
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:37.980]   Isn't that all on there?
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.460]   I downloaded a trait.
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.780]   You can download the app on its own and it's killer.
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:43.140]   Oh, that's so good.
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:44.660]   It really is a great app.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:45.660]   So you go to the sliders.
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.340]   It says, "I know this is a portrait."
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.340]   I don't know.
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:51.340]   I can't tell.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.340]   I was struggling just to find a selfie of myself.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.740]   It doesn't have to be a selfie.
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.300]   It can be just a picture of anybody.
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:00.300]   So whereas...
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.220]   Yes, you still have pop.
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:03.220]   Yeah, I don't have any.
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:06.300]   So they're going to replace pop with background.
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.660]   I don't think it can tell that's...
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.580]   It's not obviously a portrait.
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:11.580]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:12.580]   So let me go to a different one.
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:13.580]   Pick a different one.
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:14.580]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.580]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.380]   Oh, good.
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:18.380]   That's a portrait.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.700]   That's a portrait and it's not there.
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:22.900]   That's a portrait.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.220]   Slider, edit, pop.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.220]   You got pop too.
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.220]   Yeah, that's odd.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:35.580]   So well, it's not being pushed out universally yet, right?
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:41.140]   Mr. Bundy, when you had that slider, I guess it gives you a little more control on how far
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:44.980]   to the edge of the subject you can get because the previous...
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:48.740]   No, I'm assuming it automatically.
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:52.780]   It was not super good.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:12:00.260]   I mean, granted, I was using it on a picture of my son whose hair is epic.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.260]   Right.
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:04.100]   And hard to do.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.100]   Yes, hard.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.340]   I just think I don't have the update otherwise I'd show you.
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:09.140]   This is clearly a portrait of Lisa, right?
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:12.700]   I mean, there's no question about that and I still have pop at the bottom.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.100]   Not the pop isn't great.
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:15.100]   Right.
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.580]   How do you even get to that?
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.060]   You have to hit the control sliders twice.
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.900]   I'm not even a twice.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:21.900]   Twice.
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:26.260]   So there's one and there's two because it comes up with the filters first.
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:29.340]   So, all right, well, Stacy's got it.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.500]   So it's out.
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.500]   It's coming out.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:32.500]   I don't even have pop.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.700]   I just have light color and blur.
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.900]   Yeah, that's what happened on this other image of my Mr. Dibless.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.500]   I love this one too.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.300]   Wait, what did you just say, Jeff?
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.500]   You have light color and blur.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.300]   That's that's it.
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.300]   Blur.
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:48.300]   Light color and blur.
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.300]   Oh, it does.
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:51.300]   It does.
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.300]   It does.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.300]   Light color and pop.
[01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:54.300]   It does it for this picture.
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:57.300]   You either get light color and pop for non-portricatures.
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:00.180]   Oh, I do have light color and blur.
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.180]   So it's buggy.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.540]   You're so privileged.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:04.740]   You're a lucky, lucky man.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:08.180]   It didn't work for my selfie that I found, but it did work for this.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:09.780]   Well, it's got to use AI, right?
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.780]   It's trying to figure it out.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.780]   Try it out.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:12.780]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:13.780]   God, they hide things.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:14.780]   Geez.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:15.780]   They have a new feature and you're never going to find it.
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:18.980]   It is pretty deep in there, isn't it?
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.260]   Well, I mean, it's a super-
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:21.980]   Now it's a pop.
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:22.980]   Your says pop.
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.740]   Well, I guess the wrong photo.
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:25.860]   I thought it was going to be more of a-
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:28.580]   If it thinks it's a portrait, it will be-
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.580]   It'll do it.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:30.580]   It'll do it.
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:32.580]   If it thinks it's a portrait, but it's not.
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:34.700]   It's new chiffon.
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:39.060]   And I will say because my image has decent contrast that-
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.060]   Well, there we go.
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:41.060]   There we go.
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:42.060]   That looks pretty good.
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.060]   That looks great.
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:45.900]   So yeah, contrast is something it's using for sure.
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.340]   Ants photos are too good to me.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.340]   Very partial with blue and t-shirt.
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:51.980]   Do you see that, Miss Bond?
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:55.540]   Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:58.220]   go to the Wolverhead Shaw.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.540]   He's slamming butt shut.
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:02.540]   Is the tricaster stunned?
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:05.540]   Go to the Wolverhead Shaw.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:08.820]   Go to the Wolverhead Shaw.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:11.460]   You can hear him slant the butt in the butt in the butt in the butt in the butt.
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:12.460]   That's the direct screenshot.
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:13.460]   I'm trying it.
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:14.460]   Okay.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.460]   There it is.
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:16.460]   There it is.
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:17.460]   Sorry.
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.300]   Go to the Wolverhead.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.180]   So look at- Yeah, yours worked.
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:22.780]   You got blur and that's really beautiful.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.780]   This is pretty good.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:28.380]   So this was not shot with what they call bokeh, bokeh in the background.
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.060]   This one ICLAvesPop.
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.540]   And that's got to be a portrait.
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:32.540]   Right.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:33.540]   So I don't have it yet.
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:34.540]   Here is another feature.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.380]   I'll show you it on mine.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.180]   I'll give you my son.
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:39.180]   I don't care.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:41.340]   I don't want to see it anymore.
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.340]   Here is another he can have it.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.180]   This is going to be an eight hour.
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:46.180]   The Google change log is long.
[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:47.180]   Let's go.
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:48.180]   Uh oh.
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:49.180]   Oh, Stacy's impatient.
[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:51.180]   Everybody wants to see it.
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:53.180]   This is no matter Karsten.
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.780]   Here is a great picture.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:55.780]   Is that Zach?
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:56.780]   That is a cool shot.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:59.300]   Alex has great hair.
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.780]   And here's the blur at the bottom.
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:03.500]   So oh yes, it works pretty well.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:07.780]   It's kind of like apples where because it's here on the edges, it's a little soft on the
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:08.780]   edges.
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.780]   Right.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.780]   That's okay.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:11.780]   But that's all right.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:12.780]   That's really good.
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:13.780]   That's really good.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:14.780]   That's really neat.
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:15.780]   All right.
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:16.780]   Enough of that.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:17.780]   I don't care anymore.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:22.220]   Put an end to robo calls with our latest update to call screen on Pixel 4 in the US.
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.220]   Sorry.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:24.220]   Thank you.
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.660]   The Google Assistant now helps you automatically screen unknown callers and filter out robo
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.860]   calls before your phone even rings.
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:30.860]   That's awesome.
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:31.860]   Thank you, Google.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.860]   Karsten, turn off your mic.
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:34.860]   Thank you.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:35.860]   [laughter]
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.860]   I'm breathing hard.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.500]   No, it's not the breathing.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.500]   There's a machine.
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.500]   There's a hum going in there.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.740]   Yeah, there's a machine that Karsten's standing next to.
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:44.740]   It suddenly got really noisy.
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:47.580]   I think we need to fix the fan on or something.
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.580]   I don't know.
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.580]   Improved calls in duo.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:54.020]   I've been using duo lately because my daughter is an Android user and she wants to make video
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.020]   calls.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.300]   We use it a lot more now since we relocated.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:58.300]   Yeah.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:03.860]   The family can keep in touch and it's nice to see how everybody's face lit up knowing
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:06.060]   that app was on the phone.
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:11.740]   So it's doing what remember what the Facebook portal did was if you move off center, it
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:12.740]   follows you.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.060]   And it's doing that.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:15.060]   Watch.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.060]   Here's the demo.
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:20.660]   And then if somebody else, Karsten, here's the watch.
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:21.660]   Here's the demo.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:22.660]   Somebody gets else that gets in the picture.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.220]   See, they add the other person.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.980]   Oh, it's a duo bomb.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:26.980]   It's a duo bomb.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:28.300]   And then it zooms in.
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:29.300]   She's not doing it.
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:30.740]   It's just it does it automatically.
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:31.740]   I like that.
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:32.740]   That's pretty slick.
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:33.740]   I like that.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:34.740]   I'll use that.
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:35.740]   That reminds me.
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:40.100]   So way back in the day, remember when was it hangouts came out and you could put like
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.580]   hats and stuff on your head.
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:43.580]   I remember that.
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:48.620]   So we would stick pictures of other people's faces and you know, Google would figure out
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:49.620]   what to do with that.
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:53.020]   So that must have been kind of the beginning there of developing something like this.
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.940]   When a bad connection leads to spotty audio, a machine learning model on your Pixel
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:04.820]   4 predicts the next likely sound and it's going to do sound interpolation.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:11.540]   What it also reduces choppiness on your video feed with this Pixel 4's 90 Hertz screen.
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:18.060]   So duo will do 90 Hertz and on Pixel 2, 3 and 4, you can now apply a portrait filter.
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:21.380]   So if you want that blurry background, this is something Skype does and I it doesn't.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:22.860]   It works so poorly on Skype.
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.740]   It looks like it works equally poorly on duo.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.380]   I would not use that one.
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:29.180]   So it'd be worth a try though.
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.180]   Recorder app.
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:33.540]   The main point of this though is not these features, but this is going to start happening
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:36.300]   every month now.
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.180]   You're going to get live captioned on your 3A.
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:41.580]   Remember that feature I showed you where I'm watching?
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:42.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:43.580]   I've been waiting for this.
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:44.580]   That's awesome.
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:47.820]   That's a great feature.
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:54.060]   So well-being is going to get a new focus mode, flip to shush.
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.740]   Flip to shush is very useful.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:57.380]   That'll be going to the Pixel 2.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.340]   So flip to shush.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:01.420]   So if you're following, you could do it already.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.900]   If your phone's ringing, you just flip it over and it's shush.
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:04.900]   Oh, really?
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:06.580]   Do I have to turn that on?
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:08.380]   It's in the settings already in there.
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:09.900]   But it may not be on by default.
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:10.900]   I don't know.
[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:12.940]   Oh, I am totally doing that right now.
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:17.180]   And improved on device locations on the Pixel 4.
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.340]   Well, this is really cool.
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:28.580]   Another thing I noticed they added to photos with the blur is a ColourPop option.
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:29.580]   With the blur?
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:30.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:31.580]   Well--
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.580]   No, I have the pop now.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.740]   No, you see it with the blur though.
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:35.740]   You can--
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:38.500]   Blur and pop on portrait photos.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:42.300]   Now with Blur and pop on portrait photos.
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:48.540]   Well, black and white, everything that's not portrait.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:54.180]   Oh, so now that it knows your head, you can make everything black and white instead.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:55.180]   Color splash.
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:56.180]   Color splash.
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:57.180]   Color splash.
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.180]   Gotcha.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:00.980]   And that's the Google change log.
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:01.980]   Nope, that's just item one.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:02.980]   Oh, I'm just going to start giving.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:03.980]   I'm just going to start giving.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:04.980]   Wait, item one.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:05.980]   Way to go.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:06.980]   Oh, my God.
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:11.220]   Okay, let's talk about Waze because I thought this was great.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:12.220]   Okay.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:13.220]   Let's talk about Waze.
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:17.340]   Waze is going to let you show unplowed streets and black ice.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:21.260]   You can report that along with police officers and accidents, which I think is amazing.
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.260]   That's huge.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.260]   That's huge.
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:24.260]   Oh, I'm excited.
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.260]   Why?
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:31.540]   When I get behind somebody who like-- there's a kid in the car and in New Jersey, they're
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:35.940]   reporting every single pothole, which is every six inches.
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:39.180]   So this is all dependent on how to put the incoming data.
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:40.820]   Pothole, pothole.
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:41.820]   How about black ice?
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:44.220]   Jeff, explain-- what are you Easterners?
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.860]   I know you-- I know you-- you-- you-- you-- you-- you--
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:49.620]   Wazes out there on the West Coast.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:51.620]   And you form a Southern Wuss.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.620]   This-- this-- you don't know.
[01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:53.620]   Hey, we didn't-- we didn't-- we didn't like--
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:57.380]   I think we get ice in the south, dude.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.180]   Is that like blood diamonds or what?
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:00.180]   What is black ice?
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.180]   No.
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.420]   Yeah, you can hit them.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.540]   I saw in the roads that you can't see.
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:07.540]   I know it is.
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:08.540]   Yes.
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:09.540]   I'm like the same.
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.340]   Whitey people listening have never heard this before.
[01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:12.860]   Right.
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:15.340]   It's invisible ice, which is actually terrifying.
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:17.020]   It's pretty scary when you hit it.
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:17.980]   And you hit it a patch.
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.340]   But-- but the only way that Waze is going to know this--
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:20.780]   Is somebody--
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:21.300]   Tells me.
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.380]   --it tells me reported it.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:22.880]   Right.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:26.380]   And how long-- and you know, it includes the street isn't
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:28.740]   plowed yet, but what if 10 minutes later the streets plow?
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:29.240]   Right.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:29.740]   And Blaz, I see--
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:30.940]   --was a real estate problem.
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:31.540]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:35.740]   Well, no, then you-- no, because Waze will ask you if you pass
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:38.100]   a place and you've-- like, it will say,
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.620]   is this accident still here?
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:41.020]   Is the street still unplowed?
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:41.580]   And you could be like--
[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:42.100]   Did you answer that?
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:42.600]   No.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.700]   Yeah, you respond.
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:44.700]   Yeah, you should respond.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.500]   It's a one.
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:46.300]   It's a one button thing.
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.140]   There's a car-- I'm sorry, I'm being grumpy.
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:50.940]   There's a car on the side of the road.
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:51.820]   Well, yeah.
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:52.820]   And it doesn't affect me.
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:54.380]   And why do I-- why are you telling me?
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.180]   Don't tell me.
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:55.620]   I see that a lot.
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:58.060]   People slow down and it creates traffic.
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.460]   No, not Jersey.
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.300]   The people pull off all the time to do things.
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:02.820]   And we keep going because we're Jersey.
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.380]   We know how to keep going.
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:05.060]   It's OK.
[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:05.820]   That's the one time I've--
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.580]   Let's talk about this.
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:10.140]   Was he West Postures?
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.740]   I am excited that Google--
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:13.380]   I was excited that Google's going
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:16.940]   to wake your alarm up or change your alarm based on the weather.
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:17.700]   Tell me about that.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.420]   That's kind of cool.
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:21.660]   Like, if it's raining, it's going to get you up earlier or what?
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:22.380]   No, no, no.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:24.740]   It's just going to give you different music.
[01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:25.100]   But--
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.300]   Maybe it's cold outside.
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.420]   Oh, not that song.
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:30.300]   It's AI-generated piano.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:32.460]   And I don't know if you remember from a few weeks ago
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:34.580]   when we were listening to AI-generated music.
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:35.580]   That was good.
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:37.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:39.580]   Yeah, I'm not ready for the same thing.
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:43.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.300]   Oh, I hate AI music.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.300]   Yeah, I will probably wake up today so I can turn that off.
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:51.740]   You're so awful.
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:52.260]   You get up.
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:54.140]   It would make you wake up.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:56.700]   I imagine, I mean, if we can hear how bad this is,
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.540]   what if you're like a concert pianist and this wakes you up?
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.460]   You would just be like, this is my nightmare.
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:02.620]   Rage.
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:03.420]   Rage.
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:04.540]   Rage, wake up.
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.140]   Get off my piano.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:06.700]   What are you doing?
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:09.260]   I'm like, it sounds like a eight-year-old.
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:11.420]   Damn cats are the pianos again.
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:13.860]   Oh, and I've hit you up.
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:17.060]   There's ice on the intersection at 4th and Maine.
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.700]   But you're out for the black guys.
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.460]   You could go to Spain.
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:22.180]   Suddenly you're spinning.
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.740]   Suddenly you're gone.
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:27.700]   OK, that's nice.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.180]   You got some pipes, man.
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:31.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.140]   I wanted you to be a musical theater.
[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:39.620]   So this is going to come out on the Lenovo Smart Clock first.
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:42.220]   It calls it impromptu.
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:45.220]   And eventually it'll reach phones and other smart displays.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:47.140]   But they don't say exactly when.
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:51.500]   The music is all created by magenta, an open source music
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.940]   tool built around machine learning
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:57.580]   and sounding just as bad as Amazon's.
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:58.180]   Maybe worse.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:22:59.820]   I guess you don't have to pay for that?
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:00.460]   Could they not?
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:00.980]   Maybe that's why.
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:02.460]   They don't want real music.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.740]   Like, could they have paid John Legend to crew
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:05.900]   in a few bars for me?
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:07.980]   Take some of that money you're giving
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:10.380]   Siree and put it into music.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:13.580]   What's a good song for a hot day?
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.500]   It's getting hot in here.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.900]   I'm pretty good at drinking beer.
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:21.340]   Yeah, I'd wake up the--
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:23.740]   I think the weather is kind of an interesting thing.
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:25.300]   Well, so what is it?
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.740]   I didn't understand that part.
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.300]   In fact, I didn't even see that part.
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.780]   Yeah, it picks the song based on the weather,
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.140]   which--
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:35.140]   Well, it gives you information.
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.900]   So I have to really investigate deeper,
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:39.460]   but I'm so amused by it.
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:41.700]   I haven't done it yet.
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:43.180]   You know, I have a hello doorbell,
[01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:45.820]   and I have a Google Nest home hub max in the kitchen.
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.780]   And when somebody comes to the door, it's great.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:50.300]   Almost instantaneously, the doorbell rings.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:52.580]   And the home hub says somebody's at the front door
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:53.860]   and shows me a picture.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:59.500]   But lately, it's played a horse clip-glop sound.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.500]   I don't know why, yes.
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.500]   Are you doing that, Sreece?
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:05.500]   That's very good.
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:06.500]   I was doing that.
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.500]   That's very, very classy.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.380]   I think Florence Iyans hers is doing that too.
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:11.380]   Hers is too?
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.940]   Is it-- did you--
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:13.940]   It's a seasonal thing.
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:17.300]   Activate the seasonal things from the Nest doorbell?
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:18.140]   Is that what it is?
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:18.820]   It's supposed to be--
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:19.460]   They have that.
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:22.220]   That's-- that's-- that's-- that's-- that's-- that's--
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:24.460]   Yeah, if it's Christmasy, that's probably what it is.
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:25.380]   It's not Christmasy.
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.660]   It's just the horse clip.
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:28.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:29.940]   Yeah, hers did that last line on the show.
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.420]   I thought it was a book book book before the show.
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.420]   It did.
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:34.540]   It's a sleigh.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.020]   They did have some glitches with it,
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.740]   because they-- remember, they pulled--
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.860]   they turned off the Halloween ones,
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:42.420]   but they forgot to make it so you could actually take it off.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:44.460]   So people's doorbells were still doing Halloween
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:45.620]   for a little bit.
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:49.860]   So maybe this is a feature they're still working on.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:52.380]   What do you think of this in general, Ms. Stacy,
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:55.820]   being all things IoT and--
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:57.660]   Special seasonal doorbell?
[01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:00.980]   Well, no, no, no, the alarm with--
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:04.500]   the alarm with the weather sink, you know?
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:08.500]   Oh, I think that's bizarro.
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:12.940]   Just because-- like, I just don't understand what song choices
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:13.940]   have to do with the weather.
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:15.780]   Right, it's on the storm.
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:17.660]   Into this life with--
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.620]   And see, considering if you're somewhere like right now
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.860]   here in Northern California, where every morning you wake up,
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.340]   it's sort of gloomy and gray.
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:30.340]   Do you want your alarm to give you some gloomy and gray song?
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:32.140]   Well, that's-- I mean, because some people
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:33.700]   might want happier music.
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:36.340]   I mean, I like the idea of having variety in my music.
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:38.380]   Like, that's fine.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.380]   Like, I used to have-- here comes the sun alarm clock,
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:45.300]   and I hate that song with a fiery passion now.
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:46.380]   But--
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:50.100]   But it's nice if it changes it automatically based on--
[01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:51.220]   you know, if it's fog, yeah.
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:52.740]   Maybe you could like--
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.980]   you're maybe based on your calendar.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:57.100]   Like, if you have a day full of lots of meetings--
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.580]   [BEEPING]
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:00.980]   Whoa, give me that 1812 overture.
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:02.580]   Yes.
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.340]   Give me that.
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:03.780]   Sorry, Jeff.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.740]   Chrome 79 is here.
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:07.660]   It's a-- you know what?
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:12.460]   They were in a browser war, which is great for us as end users.
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:16.940]   Google, the Brave browser, our sponsor, Firefox, Microsoft's
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:18.140]   new edge with Chrome.
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:19.940]   Remember when we used to talk about--
[01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:22.460]   There's a new browser version coming out.
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:23.340]   Yeah.
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:26.500]   Well, we haven't in a while, but this is a big one.
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:30.100]   Predictive fishing.
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:31.100]   So it can kind of--
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.020]   Predictive anti-fishing?
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.220]   Yes, I think that's probably a better way to--
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.820]   a password checkup tool, which--
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.780]   Google's going to determine whether you're an idiot,
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:39.660]   and it's going to fish you.
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:41.060]   Right.
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:43.860]   The password checkup tool I've used for a long time
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:46.860]   is an extension, but it's now going to be built in.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:50.140]   So if your password has been revealed in a breach
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:53.620]   or you're using an unsafe password, it will let you know.
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:57.180]   It'll say, you know, that's been in a data breach.
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:59.820]   You should not use that again, which
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:00.780]   is, I think, a good idea.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:01.780]   Real time--
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.620]   That's been a data breach associated with you?
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.340]   No, I've seen this password.
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:07.420]   Well, that's a good question.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:07.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:09.540]   It tells you if it's seen--
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:10.060]   Yeah.
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:10.620]   Yeah.
[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:11.900]   If it's seen your--
[01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:12.580]   If your name--
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:12.580]   The counts--
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:12.580]   --the count--
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:13.740]   --is it noseured--
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:14.100]   --to get--
[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:16.300]   Yeah, it knows your account number when you're browsing in Chrome,
[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:18.380]   remember, because it--
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:19.380]   They're using a--
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:21.660]   Stop using Leel Report, 1949.
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:22.660]   Yeah.
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.020]   In order to determine if your username and password
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:26.340]   appears in any breach--
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:27.540]   this is Google--
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:31.060]   we use a technique called private set intersection
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.820]   with blinding.
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:35.980]   That involves multiple layers of encryption
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:38.540]   and allows us to compare your encrypted username and password
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:41.660]   with all of the encrypted breach usernames and passwords
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:43.500]   without revealing your username and password.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:47.620]   In other words, they look at a hash of your name and password
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:49.580]   and compare it with the hashed database.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:53.900]   And if there's a match, then the chances are good.
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.100]   It's been revealed.
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.660]   That's how have I been pwned works.
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:58.180]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:01.140]   Real time black listing of bad sites--
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:03.260]   for a long time, safe browsing's been around.
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:05.380]   The safe browsing API.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.260]   But because, according to Google,
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:11.380]   threat actors are changing sites and domains fast--
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:12.620]   How's every half hour?
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:16.060]   Yeah, there's a 30-minute delay in the safe browsing updates.
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:18.060]   So there's a new option.
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:19.940]   You should probably look in Chrome.
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:23.980]   And in the Sync and Google Services section,
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:27.100]   allow the scanning of bad sites in real time.
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.260]   So it will actually look at the data
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:31.900]   you're getting from the site for known signatures.
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:33.620]   It's like an antivirus for websites.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:33.900]   I think it's--
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:36.340]   Yeah, you should do that if you have kids.
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:39.380]   Now, Google's right to tell you this.
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:42.580]   You are sending your web browsing history to Google.
[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.380]   You're still going to anonymize it, of course,
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.340]   in URLs and all that.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:48.660]   But in order to do this, it has to do it in real time.
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:52.820]   Predictive phishing is warning you
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:55.580]   when you might be entering passwords on a site that
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:58.340]   is suspected of phishing.
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:05.380]   And so it basically will prevent you from being fished
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:07.420]   because the site looks like Twitter,
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:10.420]   but it's not or low-to-like.
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:13.740]   Mixed content-- that's been going on for a while.
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:15.940]   Tab-- oh, with this release, Google
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:19.620]   will start slowly to block mixed content on HTTPS sites.
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.660]   Mixed content is not a bad thing.
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:26.340]   Sometimes you have, for instance, a login that is HTTPS,
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:28.300]   but the whole page is not--
[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:30.580]   this is going to start blocking those.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:36.060]   So webmasters get that back, get that fully encrypted.
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:38.820]   Tab freezing unloads all the tabs that
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:41.540]   have been inactive for more than five minutes.
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:43.020]   That doesn't mean it closes them, does it?
[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:45.100]   Or just means it just stops to consider the back.
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:48.180]   Yeah, I think it just-- it leaves a little tab there,
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:50.140]   but it's not doing anything in the background.
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:50.660]   OK, all right.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:51.740]   But that's not on by default.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:56.660]   You actually have to go to Chrome colon slash slash flags
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:59.460]   to turn on proactive tab freezing.
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.900]   That's a great feature.
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:03.660]   That is a great feature, especially if you're
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:06.660]   on a Chromebook with the teeny wing resources.
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:08.540]   I close tabs, but a lot of people
[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:11.100]   like Jeff who just leave their tabs open.
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:11.780]   Are you a tab?
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:12.620]   You leave a tab.
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:14.220]   I only have six open right now.
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:14.820]   Stop at it all.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.540]   Oh, and you probably have an empty inbox.
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:16.940]   Don't you?
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:17.980]   You have not just for some--
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:18.380]   I do not have--
[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:20.140]   I am not inbox zero, so--
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:21.660]   Oh, shh.
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:23.380]   I don't subscribe to the--
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.980]   I file them away, though.
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.220]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:28.300]   I don't touch them.
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:30.720]   I like seeing that I have 23,000 already
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.500]   emails in my inbox.
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.500]   That was a moment on this show when I started--
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:34.500]   Because I realized--
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:38.740]   Search-- because Google didn't let you
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:40.380]   delete emails for a while.
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:40.880]   Right?
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.380]   Right.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:41.880]   Right?
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:45.380]   And that's what made me realize, oh, oh, OK.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:46.460]   Search them.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:47.700]   I just searched them.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:48.900]   It's a database.
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:49.460]   That's all it is.
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:50.460]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.780]   New UI for the Chrome profile section,
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:56.620]   a back forward button caching.
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:57.220]   OK, this is a spare--
[01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:59.180]   Wait, not the middle.
[01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:02.580]   Special cache for the back and forward Chrome buttons.
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:05.380]   So if you go back or forward in your browsing history,
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:07.180]   instead of-- you've seen this.
[01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:08.540]   You were on a site.
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:10.060]   You went to the pay, and then you
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.820]   pressed the back button and it says, oh, hey, I'm going to--
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:15.220]   oh, I have to reload the page.
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:17.420]   Now I'll just get it straight from cache,
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:20.100]   rather than going to the website and reloading.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.660]   And that will speed you a little bit.
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:25.140]   Another one in Chrome's--
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:26.180]   We'll do it.
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:28.660]   We'll ping to see if the site's been updated since.
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:30.300]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:31.420]   Well, or what if you--
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:33.060]   because usually they complain because they're like,
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:35.460]   now I have to do a form resubmissioned.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:37.140]   Well, let me read you what Google says.
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:38.740]   "Inables back forward cache."
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:40.420]   Note, this feature is highly experimental
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:43.260]   and will lead to various breakages up to and including
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:44.220]   data loss.
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:45.220]   Whoops.
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:47.900]   And it's in Chrome colon slash slash flag,
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:49.900]   so it won't be on by default.
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:51.060]   Lots more.
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:52.220]   Lots more.
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:54.020]   The new Chrome 79 is here.
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:55.420]   Woo hoo.
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:57.940]   Google Assistant now supports Google Keep.
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:31:59.540]   This is huge.
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:01.220]   It's the main reason I didn't use Google Keep
[01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:04.740]   is I couldn't add items to it through my Google Assistant.
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:05.660]   Yes.
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:06.660]   Now you can--
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:10.060]   not only add items, you can create a new list.
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:10.860]   And this--
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:11.860]   Command.
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.700]   Uh, I'm going to--
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:16.700]   I'm not going to say it out loud.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.700]   Hey, gee, ask Keep to create a new list.
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:20.060]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:24.140]   Or add by groceries to my HoneyDew list.
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:26.100]   And maybe it will make the list if you don't have it.
[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:27.220]   I know you have to play with it.
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.820]   How far it'll keep it in.
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:32.740]   Well, it's also going to work in any do, any list, and bring.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:35.740]   So maybe there's an API or something.
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:36.740]   I should, by the way--
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:37.740]   Yeah.
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:38.540]   Not yet.
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:42.900]   If you're a Google Fi subscriber, free Google--
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.460]   little one of those Google dots available right now.
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:45.940]   All right.
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:47.580]   Go ahead and find your account.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:48.740]   Home Mini, is that what it is?
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:49.740]   Home Mini.
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:53.340]   If you go to fi.google.com, as soon as you go there,
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:56.540]   it'll say, hey, through the end of the year.
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:58.340]   Wall supplies last through the end of the year.
[01:32:58.340 --> 01:32:59.660]   Price not included.
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:02.660]   You can't get pink because I tried.
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:03.820]   Yeah, I had to get black.
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:05.580]   My gift is here.
[01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:06.620]   Yeah, isn't that neat?
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:07.740]   Oh, I'm glad I told you.
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:09.740]   You didn't know this.
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:11.420]   Jeff's learned something today.
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:13.060]   If you pay for one of those things,
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:15.220]   you know, just clearly you're crazy.
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:18.180]   I'm just like, you can get one for buying all kinds of stuff.
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:20.340]   They're putting them in the cat and crunch boxes now.
[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:20.860]   I guess.
[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:21.860]   Exactly.
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:24.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.180]   Back to Jack.
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:26.300]   To see if you have--
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:26.820]   That's free.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:28.300]   I don't need one, but it's free.
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.180]   Yeah, I don't need one either.
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:31.260]   No, don't do that.
[01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:32.300]   Don't do that, you guys.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:35.340]   That's a bunch of electronic ways that gets generated.
[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:36.700]   It's fine stuff to do with it.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.140]   I'm going to use it at the school.
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:41.740]   I've been driving around with a Google assistant in my trunk
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:42.940]   of my car because--
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.100]   Wow.
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.140]   My daughter said it doesn't work.
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:48.020]   I just put it in my trunk.
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:50.780]   Here's how you do it.
[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:52.740]   It's going to be rolling out to integrate Google Keep
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.740]   Any Do Any list with your Google Assistant.
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:57.260]   To see if you have this option, open the Assistant Settings,
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:58.420]   go to the Services tab.
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:00.300]   If you have Notes and Lists as an option,
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:03.660]   select the service you prefer off you go.
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:04.940]   Any Do's good.
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:06.540]   Use that for a long time.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:10.100]   I'm guessing it's not going to work with my Apple reminders,
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.060]   but--
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.180]   Oh, well.
[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:13.780]   I was a wonderless guy.
[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:14.820]   Wonderless.
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:15.500]   He just killed it.
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:16.700]   And he just killed it.
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:18.620]   Keeps good.
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:21.220]   It doesn't have--
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:21.900]   I let it go.
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:23.300]   I ended up going back to Evernote.
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:24.580]   I have grocery lists there.
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:25.100]   Evernote?
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:26.780]   What was Gina's thing?
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:27.500]   Gina Tappani?
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:28.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:30.900]   She had to do.text.
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:33.860]   And that was a fully text-based to-do list, which was awesome.
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:35.100]   Really simple and direct.
[01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:36.540]   I love that.
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:38.620]   Loved that.
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:40.860]   Boy, there's a whole lot more.
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:41.620]   All Google--
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:42.180]   We're doing great.
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:44.780]   All Google Fi supported.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:48.020]   Android devices will get spam call warnings and Wi-Fi
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:49.500]   calling, all of them now.
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:53.420]   All five features on all five phones.
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:56.940]   I didn't realize you couldn't, but there you go.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:58.540]   iPhones are Fi compatible.
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:34:59.660]   Oh.
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:00.620]   Oh.
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:01.140]   So--
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:02.900]   OK, so this goes beyond pixels.
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:03.380]   Oh, OK.
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:04.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:07.220]   So this is weird, because you could put a Fi chip
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:08.660]   in a lot of stuff.
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:11.660]   And it's not fully Fi.
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:13.340]   It doesn't do like the network switching, right?
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:14.860]   It just becomes a T-Mobile.
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:17.180]   I don't know.
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:18.900]   So yeah.
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:21.380]   Any Fi compatible device, including iPhones,
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:22.860]   get spam call warnings, the ability
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:24.660]   to block specific numbers.
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:26.860]   All Android phones on Google Fi are getting access
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:31.940]   to the enhanced VPN network and Wi-Fi calling.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:34.700]   It's in the Fi app on the phone settings menu.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:37.020]   So just go to the Fi app and see.
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:38.300]   That's nice.
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:42.780]   We mentioned the Fi Nest Mini.
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:48.620]   AR core phones can now detect depth with one camera.
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:54.660]   So that means your Pixel 3A can do depth now with its back
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:56.180]   camera there.
[01:35:56.180 --> 01:35:59.260]   This is a new feature of AR core.
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:01.580]   So see the cat?
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:05.500]   See the cat standing in the middle of the chair.
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:07.540]   See the cat behind the chair.
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:09.380]   That's an example.
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:11.740]   The cat appears behind the furniture
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:14.180]   instead of standing in front of it.
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:17.820]   It's because it's now got 3D depth.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:18.300]   Yeah.
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.180]   That's AI at work, baby.
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:21.860]   I'm confused.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:22.060]   That's a--
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.620]   Computational AR.
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:26.500]   Does it help if I say that a deep fake?
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:27.500]   Is that a cat deep fake?
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:28.500]   It's not real.
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:30.900]   It's a AR cat.
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:32.060]   So now does that help?
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:33.460]   Now it looks more like a real--
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:34.460]   Deep fake cat.
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:40.900]   Google Maps.
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:41.580]   Oh no.
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:42.900]   Google's going to fall apart.
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:44.820]   People will fake their cats in all these places
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:46.300]   where there aren't cats.
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.380]   What will we do?
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:50.780]   Or simulating sex acts with cats.
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.220]   And yikes.
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:53.780]   Google Maps.
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:55.580]   Well, that's what Deep Fakes is all about.
[01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:56.220]   Let's face it.
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:37:01.620]   No, I thought it was about Vladimir Putin Leo.
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:03.860]   I didn't think it was about sex with cats Leo.
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:04.860]   No.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:06.700]   We need to get rid of it.
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:08.260]   Next on the list.
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:08.540]   Yeah.
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:11.140]   Google will let you attach emails to emails.
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:13.100]   It's emails all the way down.
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:15.700]   You can now attach emails to other emails in Gmail
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:17.660]   without downloading them first.
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:18.300]   That's great.
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:20.060]   Don't know why you would want to do that.
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:20.860]   But you can--
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:23.140]   Well, why would you want to do that?
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:26.580]   I have-- there are times when I want to forward things.
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:27.700]   It's a better way to forward.
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:28.180]   Right.
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:28.700]   It's just--
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:30.140]   Why is it a better way to forward?
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:30.780]   Well, let's say--
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:31.500]   Is this one to attach--
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:32.060]   Is this one to attach?
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:33.060]   Yes, next year.
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:34.500]   Next year.
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:38.020]   And just got an invitation to go see somebody's booth.
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:39.940]   He could just drag it over.
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:42.660]   Drag it out of his inbox right onto my email.
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:43.220]   As opposed to--
[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:43.860]   Do you get--
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:44.460]   Once a address.
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:45.300]   Well, hold on.
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:47.180]   Do you get the whole chain of emails?
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:50.340]   Or can you just attach one particular segment?
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:52.060]   That's the part that I'm curious about.
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.780]   Because I'd rather just have that one particular message
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:55.620]   and not the whole--
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:57.100]   I'm guessing it's just that message.
[01:37:57.100 --> 01:38:01.180]   You attach to email becomes a .eml file that's attached.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:03.460]   You can attach as many as you'd like.
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:07.020]   And when you click on the .eml email attachment in Gmail,
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:08.700]   it'll open in a new window.
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:09.220]   I'd--
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:10.220]   I bet you it's just the top one.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:13.220]   That's exactly what you do with Outlook.
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:13.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:14.340]   Yeah.
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:15.420]   Because that would be helpful.
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:17.300]   Because there are plenty of times when you're like,
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:18.900]   did I say something I shouldn't have said?
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.620]   And not even terrible things.
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:23.140]   I'm just saying stuff you don't want people to read.
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:23.380]   All right.
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:26.260]   Cognito mode arrives on Google Maps on iOS,
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:28.900]   so you can tell it don't send back to the Google
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:31.740]   where I'm going next.
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.100]   Don't send it just yet.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.780]   Don't send it yet?
[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:38.100]   Yeah, wait until I get there, and then you can send it.
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:42.940]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, we conclude the world's launch.
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:43.940]   Space is asleep.
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:47.420]   Google change law.
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:50.140]   No, I had a migraine, and I took some migraine medicine,
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:51.460]   and it's just knocking me out.
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:53.900]   So I'm kind of terrible right now.
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:55.420]   We can wrap this up.
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:55.740]   Are you better?
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:56.300]   Oh, no.
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:57.260]   This is it.
[01:38:57.260 --> 01:39:00.540]   I am yawning a lot, and I'm sorry.
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:02.060]   No, I thought you were doing--
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:05.620]   I honestly got-- I thought you were doing a long change log
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:06.540]   joke.
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:07.780]   Oh, no.
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:09.020]   No.
[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:09.380]   Sorry.
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:12.300]   I was thinking of you credit for your rye humor.
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:17.860]   I know what I want to do.
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:19.380]   What do you want to do?
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:21.500]   Because you wouldn't let me make fun of Peloton much,
[01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:22.940]   because you got all huffy about it.
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:24.780]   So you're going to let Ryan Reynolds do it.
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:25.980]   Yeah, it's the best.
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:26.940]   Do you think he works for you?
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.020]   All right, you guys see this?
[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:29.740]   Can I play this?
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:31.300]   Is it going to get us pulled down?
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:32.580]   I don't think so.
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:35.020]   Watch.
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:38.700]   Here's a poor person who is--
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:40.060]   The same woman for the Peloton, Adam.
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:41.340]   Is it the same woman?
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:42.420]   Oh, yes.
[01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:43.580]   Yes, she's looking sad.
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:44.620]   She's at a Martini bar with her friends.
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:46.500]   His chain is really smooth.
[01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:47.300]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.460]   Her friends are looking very concerned.
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:50.660]   Do you like?
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:53.140]   You're safe here.
[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:54.500]   To new beginnings.
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:57.940]   To new beginnings.
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:00.260]   They're drinking Martinis.
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:02.340]   She's really drinking the Martini.
[01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:03.300]   It's a fun night.
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:03.820]   Wow.
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:04.940]   All the way down.
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.020]   One is too nice.
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:08.020]   She's going to drink her friends Martini.
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:08.860]   Impressive.
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:09.580]   It's an avi--
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:12.100]   Oh, I like the way.
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:14.060]   And then it ends with-- you look great, by the way,
[01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:15.260]   with the gin there.
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:18.420]   Because I was just need the Peloton, because she looks great.
[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:19.060]   Oh, played.
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:21.540]   I didn't even know that was a takedown of a Peloton.
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:24.620]   The reason is Brian Reynolds is he owns Aviator Gin.
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:25.180]   Yes.
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:25.580]   Yes.
[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:28.220]   And our sponsor at Mint Mobile, he's apparently making way
[01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:29.140]   too much money.
[01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:31.140]   Aviation Gin.
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:34.580]   How about we make an aviator?
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:36.780]   Aviation is actually the drink.
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:37.980]   OK.
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:38.740]   Sorry.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:39.500]   Is it really--
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:40.460]   It's a good gin.
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:41.060]   It's a good gin.
[01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:41.260]   It's a good gin.
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:43.140]   Yeah, it's aviation.
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:44.580]   I actually looked up where I can buy it.
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:46.380]   I was so pleased with that commercial.
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:47.860]   Oh, don't go buy it for that.
[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:49.820]   I mean, it's fine if you're in a hotel bar.
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:51.260]   Buy a better gin.
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:52.740]   I mean, like--
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:54.180]   Buy a more-- let me rephrase that.
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:56.420]   You presume I buy good gin.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:56.940]   Why?
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:01.580]   I go to Gary Vee's family's wine store.
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:03.780]   That's why I've shopped for years and years and years.
[01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:07.500]   They don't have a big interesting gin collection there.
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.700]   That's a wine store.
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:09.940]   That's about wine.
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:10.540]   No, no, no.
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:12.060]   The second floor is all hardly.
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:12.580]   Bevmo.
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:13.340]   Look, baby.
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:16.220]   Bevmo has all the gins.
[01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:16.700]   Really?
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:18.900]   I actually went to a gin tasting last night
[01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:23.940]   and I tasted hopusa, which is a South African gin.
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.940]   No, no, hopusa is from Goa, I lied.
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:30.620]   And then wilder, wilder, I can't say it.
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:31.620]   And that's a South African.
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:34.420]   What was your favorite?
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:37.540]   Surprisingly, raw, I did not like the South African one.
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:40.020]   But when it was with tonic, it turned
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.180]   into just the best beverage.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:44.460]   I was very excited.
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:47.260]   So there we go.
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:48.860]   I'm just running down.
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:50.620]   I don't mean that you sure it's a bag of rain,
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:52.740]   you had another hangover?
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:53.500]   Oh, yes.
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:54.500]   It was--
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:55.000]   I don't.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:55.500]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:56.500]   It was a bad joke.
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:56.940]   That was too easy.
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:01.940]   We were pouring little tiny, like half ounce tasting pores.
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:02.940]   And I only had three.
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:05.220]   So that's one and a half ounces.
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:08.500]   I am going to be mad for a moment at Verizon.
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.140]   It's so easy to be mad at Verizon.
[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:10.660]   Oh boy.
[01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:11.180]   It is.
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:11.740]   It is too easy.
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:14.060]   They bought Yahoo, you may remember.
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:17.140]   And they're closing down Yahoo groups.
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:20.100]   There is a group of internet archivists
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.780]   who have been trying to collect.
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.860]   God's work.
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:23.780]   Doing God's work.
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:24.660]   Do you know how many?
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:30.580]   There are 5.6 million groups on Yahoo groups.
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:33.780]   And in just a few days, the data is going away.
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.260]   It'll be gone.
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:35.620]   Wow.
[01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:36.780]   It's a racing history.
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:37.780]   Yeah.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:42.660]   So the archive is trying to save as much as they can.
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:45.100]   They've already saved 1.8 billion messages.
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:46.340]   They've been doing this for a while
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:51.420]   ever since they found out Yahoo was going to shut it down.
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:53.940]   And this is only for groups, right?
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:55.660]   This is for groups.
[01:42:55.660 --> 01:43:02.260]   And this team published a message saying,
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:05.620]   Yahoo has banned all the email addresses the volunteers
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:09.220]   are using to download data, making it impossible for us
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:14.620]   to use the scripts we're using to capture the groups.
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.380]   Oh, that's just true.
[01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:21.180]   Yahoo has said to the group, the resources
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:24.060]   needed to maintain historical content from Yahoo groups' pages
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:29.900]   is cost-prohibited, prohibitive, as they're largely unused.
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:32.780]   The people had violated the archives violated
[01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:34.340]   the terms of service.
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:36.740]   They suggested the number of users affected was small.
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:41.300]   Well, yeah, they're volunteers, 128 people.
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:44.740]   Regarding the 128 people who join Yahoo groups of the goal
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:48.660]   to archive them, are these people from archiveteam.org?
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:51.540]   If so, their actions violated our terms of service.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:52.820]   Because of this violation, we're
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:56.780]   unable to reauthorize them.
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:44:01.100]   Yahoo's just a jerk, clearly.
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:03.340]   Verizon--
[01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:05.780]   I mean, Verizon's a jerk.
[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:07.300]   There is no more Yahoo.
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:09.660]   It's consumed into the world.
[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:13.500]   So as of today, they've extended the deadline
[01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:17.660]   for requesting to download data to Friday, January 31.
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:19.820]   Now, the point of this is that many of these groups
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:20.500]   are abandoned.
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:21.900]   All of the messages were public.
[01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:24.700]   They're not downloading private messages.
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:25.980]   No privacy violations.
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:30.020]   But you have to be a member of the--
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:33.420]   the administrator of the group to use Verizon's download tool
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:35.020]   to archive the group.
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:38.020]   And since many of these millions of groups are old
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:43.380]   and nobody's around, they're not getting downloaded.
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:48.700]   So I think it's a worthy thing to archive.
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:49.060]   Yes?
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:49.660]   I agree.
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:53.780]   I hope Verizon listens and says, oh, yeah,
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:55.060]   there is some history here.
[01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:57.460]   I had a bunch of Yahoo groups.
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:58.300]   I didn't use groups.
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:00.900]   I did have a throwaway email.
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:02.980]   And I just decided to log into that.
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:04.980]   And there's nothing in there.
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:06.740]   Yeah, they got rid of a lot of those--
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:07.500]   All of that's gone.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:08.940]   Emails, yeah.
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:11.140]   Didn't know that.
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:15.140]   So 1.4 million groups have public message archives
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:20.340]   and estimated number 2.1 billion messages.
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:21.780]   Just give it to the internet archive
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:22.740]   and just let them deal with it.
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:23.660]   There are a lot of them.
[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:24.660]   There are a lot of them.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:26.060]   But they didn't get all of them.
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:30.780]   So anyway, I just wanted to bring that up.
[01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:33.860]   Verizon notorious for doing the wrong thing
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:35.260]   until they get caught.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:38.180]   So maybe now that they've been caught, they'll go, oh,
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:39.140]   this is bad PR.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:40.980]   We maybe we should fix this.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:42.900]   They won't.
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:43.740]   Spotify.
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:44.700]   Spotify.
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:45.180]   That's history.
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:48.260]   End of the year for Spotify.
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:54.460]   They have talked a little bit about podcasts.
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:59.820]   You may remember that Spotify spent a lot of money on podcasts.
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:02.060]   They bought podcasts, a production company,
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:07.060]   Gimlet, Worth, and Anchor, the podcast production
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:10.100]   tool for $300 million.
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:12.740]   Later, they bought Parcast, the crime mystery
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:18.380]   and sci-fi producer, spending around $400 million.
[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:21.660]   Spotify's goal is to become the premier producer of podcasts,
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:24.900]   the leading platform for podcast creators.
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:32.100]   And apparently it's working for them.
[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:36.780]   They are showing significant bumps in the number of listens.
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:39.540]   Let me see if I can find that number because I saw it here.
[01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:42.980]   500,000 podcast titles on Spotify.
[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:45.300]   Listeners have grown by more than 50%
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:49.140]   since the start of the year, 50% growth since January.
[01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:49.780]   Good for them.
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:52.500]   39% increase in podcast hours consumed
[01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:54.580]   by listeners quarter over quarter.
[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:58.500]   The most consumed podcast on Spotify,
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:02.580]   the Joe Button podcast with Rory and Mal.
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:03.660]   Don't know that one.
[01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:05.220]   I've heard of it, but that's about it.
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:08.980]   It's like I'm unaware of this.
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:10.420]   The big category?
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:13.340]   The more I see it, no, that's right.
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:13.820]   We're old-ish.
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:16.020]   Well, and the only thing that's bad about Spotify
[01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:18.020]   is-- and they aren't doing it always,
[01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:21.300]   but things that are exclusive to Spotify, right?
[01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.340]   You have to have the Spotify app to listen to.
[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:24.860]   You can be Spotify free tier, but you
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:26.620]   have to have the Spotify app.
[01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:29.940]   And of course, that gives them advertiser metrics.
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:32.180]   They know all about what you're doing,
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:33.900]   how much you listened, how long you listened,
[01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:36.140]   when you listened, who you are.
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:38.620]   And they can use that with advertisers.
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:42.100]   That puts pressure on us and other independent podcasts
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:45.380]   because, hey, we can't really do that
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:50.020]   because we want you to listen on whatever app you want.
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:52.900]   And also, we don't want people to spy on our users.
[01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:53.460]   That's right.
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:55.420]   We know that privacy is important to you.
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:57.660]   However, we have some grave concerns,
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:58.340]   and we're not alone.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:00.180]   A lot of podcasters are really starting
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:03.220]   to be concerned now that because of stuff like this,
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:06.140]   there's going to be incredible pressure from advertisers.
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:08.460]   Hey, we want to track your listeners.
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:11.140]   And if you don't let us, then you're
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:12.540]   not going to get the ad buy.
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:13.940]   We're starting to hear that.
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:16.300]   And a number of other podcasters,
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:18.740]   so if there was a video on Post on YouTube by another guy,
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:20.260]   who said this is going to be a real problem,
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:21.980]   ad tech is coming to podcasting.
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:24.340]   And Spotify's leading the charge, frankly.
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:30.060]   They're number one categories, comedy, society and culture,
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:33.780]   true crime, news, and health and fitness.
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:36.220]   I don't see technology on that list, so.
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:37.540]   There is no tech there.
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:40.100]   Well, Spotify is for more normal people, too.
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:41.060]   It is.
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:41.580]   We're happy.
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:42.900]   We're happy.
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:45.700]   No, in fact, there's a whole thread on our Twitter forums,
[01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:47.980]   the Twitter community, about are people
[01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:49.140]   who listen to Twit weird?
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:52.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.620]   They're weird in a good way, though.
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:56.380]   The answer is in the best way.
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:48:57.060 --> 01:49:02.460]   I used to use Spotify for podcasting, listening to podcasts.
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:07.140]   But my friend Todd Moore, he had that passion app PlayaPod.
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:09.180]   And I've been stuck on that ever since.
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:12.740]   But I get why people want to use Spotify.
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:13.620]   It's a nice app.
[01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:15.220]   It's straightforward.
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:21.020]   And like she says, normal people can use it without an issue.
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:25.100]   75% of UK marketers are looking to increase their spend
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.780]   in podcast advertising.
[01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:29.060]   It's a very hot category.
[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:31.660]   This is an article from The Drum, which is a UK, I guess,
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:33.860]   a UK blog.
[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:37.900]   Some analysts are saying that audiences
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:43.020]   react more negatively to ads on podcasts than other ad formats.
[01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:44.900]   I don't think that's true of our audience.
[01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:49.500]   But podcast ads have a net positive score of negative nine,
[01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:55.620]   globally, versus plus 43 for magazine ads out of home ads.
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:58.820]   That's probably because you can skip right past a magazine
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:49:59.100]   ad.
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:00.260]   You can't skip past it.
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:01.660]   Or you can, but--
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:02.740]   TV ads?
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:04.980]   Positive 32.
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:07.260]   Radio ads positive 27.
[01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:11.780]   Podcasts though do beat mobile display ads, negative 11,
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:13.780]   and mobile video negative 13.
[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:16.020]   This is from Canter ad reaction.
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:18.500]   This is what they do.
[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.860]   However, Global Head of Media, Canter,
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:23.500]   says podcasts are becoming increasingly embedded in consumer
[01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:28.220]   and business marketing due to the ease of hand-picking audiences
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:32.100]   and serving relevant and tonally appropriate content.
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:34.860]   Totally appropriate.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:38.660]   Oh, you ever heard that phrase referring to you?
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.460]   Yes.
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:40.900]   She's tonally appropriate.
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:47.180]   Spotify lets advertisers target podcast listeners directly.
[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:49.620]   And that's the key, right?
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:53.420]   Samsung and 3M are among the first brands to test the tool.
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:57.260]   It has since made the targeting even more granular.
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:59.700]   And oh, good news, Barack and Michelle Obama
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:03.900]   are on board to co-produce exclusive podcasts for Spotify.
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:06.460]   Because they're so good money.
[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:08.980]   Apparently, they spend a lot of money on that.
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:12.940]   It's interesting to think about your post-presidential career.
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:14.340]   I guess--
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:16.940]   Well, I mean, the Netflix show, they're
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:21.420]   doing things that are not the traditional speaking to banks.
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:24.020]   And Michelle Obama's autobiography
[01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:27.300]   is easily the top book of 2019, right?
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:28.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:31.740]   Easily, really popular.
[01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:34.620]   All right, I think we should break,
[01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:38.540]   because Stacey is ready to have some more gin.
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:39.460]   No.
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:39.940]   No.
[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:40.340]   Oh, wait.
[01:51:40.340 --> 01:51:41.940]   No, I had a story.
[01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:42.420]   Oh.
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:42.940]   Oh.
[01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:44.780]   Oh, but it's not a Google story.
[01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:45.340]   I don't care.
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:46.980]   It's OK.
[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:49.420]   Today, this is near and dear to my heart
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:51.500]   and any super nerdy tech people.
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:54.420]   Cisco finally said that they were going to sell
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:59.340]   a standalone networking chip that is not part of their gear.
[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:02.540]   And I know that many of you guys are like, eh, who cares?
[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:05.420]   But as someone who's covered Cisco for like two decades,
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:06.980]   there's a huge deal for them.
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:12.580]   And it also shows how much power, the disaggregation
[01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:16.460]   of the computing infrastructure that the hyperscale data
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:20.180]   center guys have really made.
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:22.660]   So I just thought that was pretty cool.
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:26.700]   Is there anything particularly interesting about the chip?
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:30.820]   It probably offers a lot of networking speed.
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:33.780]   What's interesting is Cisco has never--
[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:36.740]   disaggregation has never been Cisco's game.
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:38.620]   And they have done custom chips.
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:41.660]   But if you bought Cisco gear, you would get a custom chip.
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:43.140]   But that's the only way to get it.
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:45.260]   But now they're like, crap.
[01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:47.980]   Google's building their own switches, Facebook, Microsoft.
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:49.460]   Everybody's doing it.
[01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:52.180]   We can't sell our boxes at a premium anymore.
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:54.300]   We might as well just give them the silicon.
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.700]   So that's where they're going.
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:56.220]   Interesting.
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:57.260]   OK, that's it.
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:58.220]   It's just super nerdy.
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:52:59.220]   And I love it because--
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:52:59.980]   Well, it empowers--
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:05.580]   --of our new ideas in internet routers.
[01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:10.260]   Well, so Cisco was kind of--
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:13.300]   it helped fund it, but it was a little behind the impact
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:15.300]   that Software Defined Networking was going to have on them.
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:18.140]   And that was the big sea change in networking
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:20.660]   in the last probably decade or two,
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:23.380]   which is the separation of the control
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:26.540]   plane from the data plane.
[01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:29.740]   And so when you think of this, this
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:33.380]   is about the internet as a whole and as in big data centers.
[01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:37.980]   This isn't for consumers except as we consume product
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:38.900]   from those companies.
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:41.980]   Royal Knight and our chat room maybe puts us in perspective.
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:43.820]   He said, this would be like Google licensing
[01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:45.500]   their search technology.
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:46.260]   Thank you.
[01:53:46.260 --> 01:53:47.020]   Yes.
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:48.300]   It's a big deal.
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:51.580]   It is a huge big deal for Cisco.
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:53.940]   It's their secret sauce and they're letting other players.
[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:54.940]   Right.
[01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:57.140]   And that's to me-- I mean, because again, covered them forever.
[01:53:57.140 --> 01:53:59.660]   And they had a lock on their gear.
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:01.340]   And they were never going to take it apart.
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:03.020]   But today, they took it apart.
[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:05.420]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:06.540]   Thank you, Royal Knight.
[01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:09.180]   Thank you, Stacey Higginboth.
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:09.860]   Let's take a break.
[01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:12.940]   Your tips and picks and numbers and all that stuff coming up.
[01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:15.180]   But I first have a tip for you.
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:17.380]   A better browser, it's brave.
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:18.620]   Now, we were just talking about how
[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:21.020]   Chrome is doing all these changes to Chrome.
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:22.500]   One of the beauty parts of all of this
[01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:24.220]   is that Chrome is an open source browser.
[01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:26.700]   It's based on a Chromium platform.
[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:31.940]   And many of the features in Chrome go into Brave, but not all.
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:33.660]   Only the good stuff.
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:36.820]   Not the feature, for instance, that blocks you block origin,
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:38.620]   my favorite, and blocker.
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:41.060]   Brave has built-in ad blocking.
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:43.220]   But Brave will work with all the Chrome extensions
[01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:45.340]   because it's based on Chromium.
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:47.580]   What I find is I don't have to install as many Chrome
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:50.980]   extensions because Brave does so much to protect my privacy.
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:54.220]   And security just right out of the box.
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:58.420]   In fact, Brave is built by a team that's focused on both privacy
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:54:59.380]   and performance.
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:02.140]   Brave is a lot faster because you're not downloading
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:05.980]   all that weird JavaScript and the ads and all the weird stuff.
[01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:08.620]   It's up to six times faster than the competition.
[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:11.380]   Unmatched speed, online privacy.
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:15.260]   Yes, of course, it blocks ads and trackers right out of the box.
[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:18.780]   It's a better user experience, and it's free.
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:22.180]   And since every operating system, even Apple,
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:26.500]   allows you to have multiple browsers download a copy of Brave.
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:27.220]   It's on iOS.
[01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:30.300]   It's on Android, Mac, Windows, even Linux.
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:30.980]   And try it.
[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:33.580]   And I think you'll see it gives you all the benefits of Google's
[01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:39.580]   Chrome without all the Googling bits, all the sending signals back.
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:40.380]   I'll give you an example.
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:43.660]   When you use a private browsing tab in Chrome,
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:45.420]   Google still sees what you're doing.
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:48.180]   It's just not saving cookies to your hardware.
[01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:52.380]   With Brave, that private window has Tor.
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:55.060]   So no one sees what you're doing, not Brave, not anybody.
[01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:56.940]   You're completely anonymized.
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:59.580]   That's really nice.
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:02.540]   Brave also has some wonderful features
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:05.940]   that Jeff will like because, of course, ad blocking
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:07.420]   does have one negative impact.
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:08.220]   It's great for you.
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:11.780]   It improves your security, your lowers your battery usage,
[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:15.740]   lowers your data usage, speeds up websites.
[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:17.620]   But it takes money out of the mouths
[01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:19.740]   of some very deserving websites.
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:21.580]   Brave was trying to figure out how to do this.
[01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:24.580]   And they've created a way to reward publishers
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:28.500]   with their fair share of web revenue with bat tokens,
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:30.340]   basic attention tokens.
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:33.740]   And the idea is you can either buy bat with cash
[01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:38.340]   or you can opt into privacy respecting Brave ads.
[01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:40.260]   And they're very non-intrusive.
[01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:42.300]   I've turned them on and earn bat.
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:44.780]   And then you can say to content creators,
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:47.900]   I'm going to award you with basic attention tokens
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:50.780]   so that you can continue to do the great work you're doing.
[01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:53.060]   I think this is a great solution to help fix the web,
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:56.900]   improve privacy, and give publishers their due.
[01:56:56.900 --> 01:56:59.100]   It's just one more reason you want to definitely look
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:56:59.820]   into Brave.
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:01.380]   I am a huge fan.
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:02.980]   It's all I use now.
[01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:05.020]   Go to brave.com/twit.
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:05.980]   Now I know you're smart.
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:07.780]   You can just go to Brave and download it.
[01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:09.420]   You could Google it and download it.
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:12.740]   But if you would, please go to brave.com/twit.
[01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:14.540]   That way they know you saw it here.
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:16.100]   We don't track you.
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:19.780]   We don't send brave information about you.
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:22.700]   The only way they will know that you saw it on Twig
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:26.580]   is if you go to brave.com/twit, T-W-I-T.
[01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:28.220]   Yesterday was about Big Tech.
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:30.180]   Today is about us.
[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:31.260]   Brave.com/twit.
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:33.580]   And that helps us when you use that URL.
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:38.060]   Helps us, frankly, continue to do privacy respecting ads
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:39.900]   on podcasts.
[01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:41.940]   And I love it that Brave is a sponsor.
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.020]   Thank you, Brave.
[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:44.180]   Save battery life.
[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:45.740]   Speed yourself up.
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.300]   More, more, more, more trackers.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:48.940]   They are really ahead of the curve.
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:52.420]   Brave.com/twit, my favorite browser.
[01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:53.700]   It should be yours, too.
[01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:54.780]   But at least download it.
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:57.700]   The best thing to do is go into settings when you download it.
[01:57:57.700 --> 01:57:58.820]   The defaults are all fine.
[01:57:58.820 --> 01:57:59.980]   But if you go to the settings, you'll
[01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:02.100]   see how much more granular you can get.
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:03.060]   You can really geek out.
[01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:05.980]   For instance, I hate it when websites pop up notifications
[01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:07.180]   saying, would you like me to notify you?
[01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:08.100]   I hate that.
[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:10.660]   So you go into the content section of Brave's settings
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:14.260]   and say, no one should bother me with it.
[01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:15.900]   When did F phenomenon start?
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:16.660]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:17.420]   It's terrible.
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:18.980]   It's recently nice.
[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:19.460]   Yes.
[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:20.420]   Every single thing.
[01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:20.980]   Crazy.
[01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:21.860]   Just go into settings.
[01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:23.020]   It's in the content section.
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:24.100]   It's a little bit buried.
[01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:25.180]   That's why maybe you didn't notice.
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:26.980]   It's in the content section you could turn it off.
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:28.580]   And then notice, I don't ever get those.
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:29.420]   Yeah, you don't have those.
[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:32.140]   I love it.
[01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:33.020]   Jeff, let's see.
[01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:33.820]   Where should we start?
[01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:35.180]   Yeah, Jeff, let's do a number.
[01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:36.460]   Jeff never gets to start.
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:38.300]   Ooh.
[01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:39.820]   I have a few.
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:40.660]   I think I'll do this one.
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:42.100]   This isn't a field good one.
[01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:44.660]   The first community of 3D printed homes
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:46.460]   at the bottom of the other section.
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:48.820]   3D printed homes.
[01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:50.740]   Alexis O'Hanean, I saw this on Facebook
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:51.900]   because I'm on Facebook because I
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:53.340]   would find out fascinating things there.
[01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:55.460]   Because if you're on Facebook, you learn things about the--
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:57.100]   I just listen to Jeff Jarvis.
[01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:57.820]   And he's on Facebook.
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:01.340]   And so Alexis O'Hanean and Gina Sanders,
[01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:02.700]   who I knew from my days at County
[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:05.020]   and asked, had a post-op about this.
[01:59:05.020 --> 01:59:07.460]   And so the effort is to do in Mexico,
[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:09.780]   a community of people of homes of their video.
[01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:11.180]   Oh, look how cool this looks.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:13.500]   They're very nice homes.
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:15.140]   But they look like they're 3D printed.
[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:16.740]   I guess it's like a concrete printer.
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:17.540]   But that's a stick.
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:18.380]   Yeah, you make it there.
[01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:18.900]   It looks good.
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:19.660]   And it looks nice.
[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:20.660]   It looks good.
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:22.420]   It's a place where Adobe's in the culture.
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:23.220]   You know what I mean?
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:24.060]   It looks like Adobe, yeah.
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:24.740]   That's awesome.
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:26.740]   Right.
[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:27.540]   Oh, I love it.
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:31.580]   And it's for people who are making $3 a day.
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:33.980]   So they're less expensive because they're 3D.
[01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:35.460]   They're 3D printed.
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:36.220]   They're less expensive.
[01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:37.780]   In 24 hours, the house goes up.
[01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:39.460]   What?
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:40.660]   You don't have to frame it.
[01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:42.740]   You don't-- oh, that's awesome.
[01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:44.140]   Isn't that--
[01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:46.980]   I would like to see this that isn't decorated by, like,
[01:59:46.980 --> 01:59:48.020]   insta-worthy people.
[01:59:48.020 --> 01:59:48.380]   I know.
[01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:48.380]   I know.
[01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:48.900]   I know.
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:49.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:51.860]   Hey, you get to decorate it any way you want.
[01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:52.940]   It's your house.
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:54.540]   That's the points.
[01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:57.700]   I'm not-- I'm just kind of like, let's be real.
[01:59:57.700 --> 01:59:58.740]   They don't look like that.
[01:59:58.740 --> 01:59:59.180]   No.
[01:59:59.180 --> 01:59:59.700]   Well, they do.
[01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:00.740]   I agree.
[02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:01.580]   They're coming.
[02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:02.460]   No, one or two does.
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:05.140]   But when you move into something like that
[02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:07.460]   and you're living on $3 a day, that's--
[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:10.780]   You don't have a $20 throw pillow.
[02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:11.100]   Yeah.
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:12.380]   All right, all right, all right.
[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:16.340]   So if you don't decorate it, they look like concrete.
[02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:17.180]   They made it a lava.
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:18.740]   Yeah, they're very--
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:19.860]   That's pretty cool, though.
[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:20.620]   Yeah, that's fine.
[02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:21.620]   I have a problem with that.
[02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:22.340]   We don't like it though.
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:23.900]   Make it whatever you want.
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:27.980]   And why is Alexis involved in this?
[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:33.020]   So I don't know if it comes out of--
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:34.660]   Is he donating to it or--
[02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:35.740]   I would imagine I just don't know.
[02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:36.980]   I saw him on Facebook.
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:38.420]   So he and Gina were there.
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:38.900]   That's all I know.
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:40.380]   I just think he's a great guy.
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:43.620]   And the fact that he's married to Serena just helps.
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:44.100]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:46.620]   And he's a stay-at-home dad.
[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:48.100]   I just love that.
[02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:48.980]   So nice.
[02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:50.060]   Or travel around the world.
[02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:50.580]   Dad is the key to be--
[02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:52.660]   Stay-at-home while staying the hotel dad.
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:53.820]   Let's put it that way.
[02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:55.220]   Stay in the hotel dad.
[02:00:55.220 --> 02:00:57.260]   That's awesome.
[02:00:57.260 --> 02:00:57.620]   Good.
[02:00:57.620 --> 02:01:01.580]   I also like how he is now Alexis O'Honey and Senior
[02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:04.700]   because his daughter is Alexis.
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:06.300]   Oh.
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:07.180]   That I didn't know.
[02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:07.700]   I didn't know that.
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:08.420]   Yeah, cool.
[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:14.220]   So with 3D printing, according to Jason Ballard,
[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:17.060]   who's co-founder of ICON, which is the company doing this,
[02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:19.420]   you not only have a continuous thermal envelope,
[02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:22.380]   high thermal mass, and near zero waste,
[02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:25.620]   you also have speed, a much broader design palette,
[02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:27.700]   next level resiliency and the possibility
[02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:29.660]   of a quantum leap in affordability.
[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:31.100]   This isn't 10% better.
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:33.500]   It's 10 times better.
[02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:36.260]   I want a 3D printed home.
[02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:37.420]   That is super cool.
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:39.940]   Well, first I want to deal with the homeless problems
[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:42.980]   in places like San Francisco where you can get some land
[02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:44.580]   and deal with this.
[02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:48.140]   Of course, it's for low density, but nonetheless.
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:48.700]   Yeah, why?
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:50.620]   Because you've got to bring in the--
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:52.020]   Well, because you're not going to do a sky-rise.
[02:01:52.020 --> 02:01:54.140]   Yeah, you can't do a sky-right or a high--
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:54.340]   What are those?
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:55.180]   High-rise.
[02:01:55.180 --> 02:01:56.180]   Oh, it's great.
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:56.700]   It's great.
[02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:57.540]   So just--
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:01:58.820]   It's just a sky-rise.
[02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:00.300]   Just to put this in perspective,
[02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:02.100]   these are the--
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:03.700]   before the homes were built, these
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:07.100]   are where these people in Tabasco, Mexico,
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:08.620]   what they were living in.
[02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:13.980]   So Stacy, I'm just going to point out the decoration.
[02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:15.500]   It ain't the day core.
[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:18.740]   It's just having a wall that's not made out of palm fronds
[02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:19.820]   or corrugated sand.
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:22.780]   No, but Stacy's point was it's all American-dumped.
[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:23.540]   Well, let me see.
[02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:29.020]   Let's see, I'm going-- this is the assets provided
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:30.620]   in the press release here.
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:33.260]   Let's see the first 3D.
[02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:37.460]   Let's see some non-fixed up homes I'm trying to find.
[02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:39.220]   Are there any not seeing anything in there?
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:42.100]   Maybe they fixed them up for you when they built them.
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:45.300]   I mean, you've got to say, I like how it looks like rope.
[02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:47.340]   I mean, I'm not a fan of rope holes myself.
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:48.540]   I think it's a--
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:51.860]   No, I'm just saying that we're registering this, which
[02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:54.980]   is probably pretty spare and very small.
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:55.980]   I mean, it is small.
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:55.980]   Yes.
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:58.900]   But you saw the check that they were living in.
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:00.140]   I did.
[02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:01.020]   And you know what?
[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:04.700]   In four years or maybe three, this is going to look similar.
[02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:05.300]   Right.
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:07.220]   Yeah.
[02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:10.380]   Really?
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:12.100]   It's a different lifestyle.
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:13.220]   It's concrete, baby.
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:14.180]   That ain't going nowhere.
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:14.780]   It's concrete, yeah.
[02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:16.420]   This is not even a small part.
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:17.420]   But it'll be--
[02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:18.860]   From a static standpoint.
[02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:19.620]   I understand.
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:21.860]   Look, they got a professional decorator in.
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:23.100]   Professional photographer.
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:24.900]   They painted the door blue.
[02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:26.420]   I don't like that shade of aqua.
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:29.340]   Could you try a little bit more aqua marine?
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:30.340]   Then it looks good.
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:30.840]   Turquoise.
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:31.740]   It's a pressuralease.
[02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:32.240]   Turquoise.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:33.740]   But I still think it's cool.
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:35.540]   And I want one.
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:39.020]   Stacey, what have you got for us?
[02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:42.380]   In addition to just bitter apples, bitter, bitter apples.
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:42.700]   No, no.
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:45.580]   You raise an important point, which is--
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:46.580]   it's often the case.
[02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:48.380]   This is all dressed up.
[02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:48.900]   You know?
[02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:49.900]   It's organized.
[02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:50.900]   It's organized.
[02:03:50.900 --> 02:03:51.900]   But you know what?
[02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:52.660]   I mean, yes, it's good.
[02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:54.380]   But it's not real.
[02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:55.900]   That's not real.
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:58.860]   Anyway, let's talk about something real and expensive.
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:02.500]   And we're tomorrow and Friday we will be releasing our IoT
[02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:03.180]   gift guide.
[02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:04.660]   Oh, exciting.
[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:05.900]   It is exciting.
[02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:08.260]   It is IoT gifts that do not suck.
[02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:11.300]   But first off, we--
[02:04:11.300 --> 02:04:13.300]   this is what I gave Kevin, actually, this year, which
[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:14.820]   is the Phillips Hue sink box.
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:16.700]   Aww.
[02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:17.980]   Every year I give Kevin a present,
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:19.980]   I make him write a review about it.
[02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:20.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:23.740]   So now I'm using a Hue hub.
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:25.140]   What does this do?
[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:26.980]   So this is the Hue sink box.
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:28.180]   It is expensive.
[02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:33.980]   But you plug that into an HDMI input, so any HDMI input.
[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:38.300]   You use these lights, and it turns your television.
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:40.460]   It does the light in conjunction
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:41.540]   with what's on your screen.
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:43.700]   So he ran a-- he did a thing of altered carbon that
[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:45.700]   shows it at the bottom, a little video.
[02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:52.580]   And there it is, the light is basically--
[02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:53.580]   Oh, that's wild.
[02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:55.100]   --the power becomes an extension of it.
[02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:56.100]   Oh, that's wild.
[02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:56.620]   It's ambient.
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:57.180]   It's beautiful.
[02:04:57.180 --> 02:04:58.460]   Yeah.
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:00.380]   So this is a nice way, if you have
[02:05:00.380 --> 02:05:03.820]   Hue products to bring this functionality in.
[02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:05.900]   So for him, he found--
[02:05:05.900 --> 02:05:11.060]   so I bought him the sink box for $229.
[02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:14.460]   Then he found a package of those two lights in a Phillips Hue
[02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:16.580]   hub for $130.
[02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:19.420]   I think you can buy the two lights for $130.
[02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:21.580]   And if you don't have a Hue hub, you have to spend like--
[02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:23.060]   I think it's $60 for that.
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:24.860]   So this is not cheap.
[02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:29.060]   But it is like-- he wanted it for Stadia gaming and for movies.
[02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:29.820]   And he likes it twice.
[02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:31.900]   Because it was a game too?
[02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:33.300]   Yeah, they have two products.
[02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:34.820]   So one is the sink box.
[02:05:34.820 --> 02:05:36.340]   That would be neat.
[02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:37.540]   Which is HDMI.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:41.460]   And then they have a cheaper one that is for video gaming.
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:44.060]   And that is-- what is that called?
[02:05:44.060 --> 02:05:47.260]   The Phillips Hue Play.
[02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:50.660]   And that syncs with your tele-- your computer.
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:52.140]   So--
[02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:55.020]   You know, I might use this in my man cave.
[02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:56.420]   It'd be kind of cool.
[02:05:56.420 --> 02:06:00.140]   I think-- I mean, like anybody who watches movies and like--
[02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:01.820]   again, it's kind of a splurge.
[02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:04.340]   But it's not like a crazy splurge.
[02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:09.180]   He's using the Hue light bars to do the lighting.
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:10.780]   So that's-- you probably wouldn't
[02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:13.060]   want to do it with light bulbs.
[02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:15.420]   You know, if you do the bulbs-- so if you use the bars
[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:18.660]   or you could use the go lights too that are on the bottom
[02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:20.940]   or anything to do like splash up of the wall.
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:22.860]   But if you use the light bulbs, you basically
[02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:24.060]   get surround light.
[02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:26.940]   So instead of surround sound, you get the light happening
[02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:28.140]   behind you.
[02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:29.540]   And he says for things like-- he's like,
[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:31.580]   I may do that for things like explosions.
[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:32.580]   Yeah.
[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:33.580]   Yeah.
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:34.580]   It's all right.
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:35.580]   It's a little pricey.
[02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:36.860]   It's-- you know.
[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:38.980]   That's why it's a good gift.
[02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:41.220]   In my world, a gift is something you would never
[02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:42.060]   buy for yourself.
[02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:43.580]   Because it's like-- that's extreme.
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:47.340]   So you could give some poor Mexican family a 3D built home
[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:51.860]   or you give yourself the Play HDMI Sync box.
[02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:53.340]   I'm going to slide off camera now.
[02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:54.780]   You're too shay.
[02:06:54.780 --> 02:06:57.780]   Take your pick.
[02:06:57.780 --> 02:06:58.860]   I'm just teasing.
[02:06:58.860 --> 02:06:59.860]   This looks good.
[02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:00.860]   I actually want to buy this.
[02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:03.220]   But I'll also just make myself feel better
[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:04.580]   by a 3D printed home.
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:05.060]   OK.
[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:06.060]   Donate a house to someone.
[02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:07.700]   I'll donate a house when I buy the--
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:08.540]   There you go.
[02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:09.060]   --sync box.
[02:07:09.060 --> 02:07:11.260]   Maybe I'll put a sync box in the house.
[02:07:11.260 --> 02:07:12.260]   Mm.
[02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:13.260]   All I was hoping to--
[02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:15.340]   I'm sure they'll sell ash masks, yeah.
[02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:18.420]   --step in the game up.
[02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:21.580]   And prove it what you have for us today.
[02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:24.340]   Mine is totally, totally random.
[02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:28.180]   This harkens back to traveling a couple years ago,
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:30.860]   and maybe it was last year.
[02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:35.220]   And the fire alarm went off in the hotel that I was staying in.
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:37.500]   And I decided to take that opportunity
[02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:39.740]   to go and shoot with it.
[02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:41.380]   Because, hey, I'm a photographer.
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:43.980]   I'm on this wheel go out and make the most of this time stay.
[02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:45.260]   Oh, I see.
[02:07:45.260 --> 02:07:47.700]   This is the key if you're a photographer constantly
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:48.500]   having that camera with it.
[02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:51.740]   The camera was literally right next to the door in the hotel room.
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:54.700]   I grabbed it, and I went out in shot
[02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:56.220]   while we waited around on the fire.
[02:07:56.220 --> 02:07:57.620]   Did you have pants on?
[02:07:57.620 --> 02:07:59.060]   And yes, I did.
[02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:01.140]   Oh, big idea.
[02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:02.660]   And I went out and shot, and I figured
[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:06.260]   I'd do this little video of a speed at it, just to show people
[02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:10.860]   part of my workflow, but also just share the story of, hey,
[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:12.620]   keep your camera around because you never
[02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:13.860]   know the opportunities that you'll
[02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:16.500]   have with photography, and sometimes you
[02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:18.220]   can get some pretty cool stuff.
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:20.060]   This one, all of my nerdy friends,
[02:08:20.060 --> 02:08:23.300]   noticed that it said 404.
[02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:27.340]   That was the number of the fire engine, as well as
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:29.300]   file not found exactly.
[02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:30.180]   So that's cool.
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:33.220]   But it's just a little walkthrough of just the speed
[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:33.780]   at it of it.
[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:36.180]   This is where Hands-On Photo is so great.
[02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:41.020]   It's kind of how to do stuff.
[02:08:41.020 --> 02:08:42.100]   And that's "Ans News Show."
[02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:43.340]   This is not part of Hands-On Photo.
[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:45.460]   This is on "Ans YouTube."
[02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:46.940]   That's on my feed.
[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:48.780]   I thought about that, and I was like, man,
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:50.700]   I remember waking up at 3.30 in the morning.
[02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:54.380]   And the thing is, this happened twice at this hotel.
[02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:55.860]   Always have your camera.
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:57.540]   Always have your camera.
[02:08:57.540 --> 02:08:58.340]   Couldn't find out.
[02:08:58.340 --> 02:09:00.700]   Never know when something's going to happen.
[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:01.260]   That's right.
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:02.780]   What is your YouTube channel?
[02:09:02.780 --> 02:09:05.380]   YouTube.com/antproit.
[02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:07.380]   This is the only one.
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:08.700]   G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G.
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:09.500]   Oh, animate.
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:12.500]   Always have your camera and always take off the lens cap.
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:13.260]   OK.
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:14.260]   Take off the lens cap.
[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:15.500]   I got some very dark shots of you,
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:17.900]   and it's not going to work very well.
[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:19.100]   Thank you, Ant.
[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:19.860]   Thank you, sir.
[02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:24.580]   Our show appears on the network live every Wednesday,
[02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:29.140]   130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 21, 30 UTC.
[02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:33.380]   If you want to watch live, you can watch "Dacy Punch Me."
[02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:35.260]   We edit those out later.
[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:37.900]   You can also get on-demand versions of the show
[02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:41.740]   at Twitter.tv/twig or subscribe in your favorite podcast
[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:42.700]   application.
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:44.820]   You know, I wouldn't even be hurt if you subscribed
[02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:45.580]   and Spotify.
[02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:47.820]   In fact, that would be a great thing to do.
[02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:50.220]   Whatever app you use, if you subscribe,
[02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:51.460]   then you get the show automatically.
[02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:54.580]   The minute it's available.
[02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:56.700]   I think we can wrap this up.
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:59.660]   Ant, what are you doing this week on Hands-On?
[02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:01.340]   Ooh, hands-on photography.
[02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:04.580]   I still have two things in mind, so I haven't decided on that one.
[02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:05.460]   What was your last one on?
[02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:07.300]   But what was the last one?
[02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:08.620]   What was the last one?
[02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:10.340]   Twitter.tv/hop.
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:12.500]   I can't remember what I did last week on "Hop."
[02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:13.700]   Because I did it early.
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:14.780]   Oh, you did an early hop?
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:15.660]   I had to do it early.
[02:10:15.660 --> 02:10:16.380]   What was it that did?
[02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:17.740]   Social media and crock-based.
[02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:20.140]   Oh, I critiqued someone's photos.
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:21.100]   That was part of it.
[02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:21.620]   Fun.
[02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:23.460]   But focus on photography.
[02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:24.860]   Please check that one out.
[02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:25.300]   Yes.
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:26.700]   That's going to be fun tomorrow.
[02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:29.740]   We have Lisa Carney joining us.
[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:32.340]   She's an outstanding graphic designer.
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:36.500]   I will say, if you go to Netflix and look at all the thumbnails
[02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:39.740]   that you see that shows the different shows and movies,
[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:41.380]   I'm pretty sure she's done most of those.
[02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:43.740]   Oh, nice.
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:44.820]   She's really good.
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:46.020]   That will be a lot of fun.
[02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:47.060]   Fun to talk to, so--
[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:47.700]   I can't wait to see it.
[02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:48.700]   Tune in for that.
[02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:50.140]   Focus on photography.
[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:52.220]   Again, Twitter.tv/live.
[02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:53.620]   If you want to watch what we're doing,

[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:08.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:11.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
