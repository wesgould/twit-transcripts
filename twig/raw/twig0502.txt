[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.960]   Oh boy this is a this is a depressing day in the Googleverse but fortunately I have two of my favorite people to cheer me up
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.960]   Both Stacy and Jeff are on assignment as they say usually when they say on assignment in local news it means they're throwing up
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.960]   In the back but in this case I think they actually are on assignment Stacy's in Scandinavia Jeffson like England or somewhere
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.960]   I'm so glad Aunt Pruitt's here though we love the aunt Aunt Pruitt from Tech Republic
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.960]   A regular on all of our shows and as you might gather if you're watching the video a Clemson Tiger fan
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   You know it just a little bit and is a true gentleman so it's always fun to have you on I appreciate it
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960]   And from I want to say Atlanta where are you?
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   No I'm right outside of Charlotte Charlotte that's right
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:12.960]   And in honor of Aunt also Mike Elgin is here from Elgin.com he is our Gastronomatic Gastronomad.net
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.960]   You just had your Mexico Mexico City experience
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.960]   I'm so jealous
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.960]   Eight tacos drank, Moscow and had a wonderful time
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   Just ended
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.960]   Just ended on Sunday
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.960]   So Aunt always has a little bit of a little something from from Scotland during the show
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.960]   And in your honor so what are you drinking today?
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.960]   I have a Glendulen 12 12 year single malt
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.960]   Yummy Yum
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.960]   Singleton
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   Oh and look he's drinking it in exactly the right class
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.960]   Yeah the camera said I'll take that
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   Yeah the camera said I'll take that
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   Yeah the camera said I'll take that
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.960]   That's good
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:56.960]   We're doing a little I you know I because I was looking because I have some Abunda or something that Richard Campbell from Dottnet Rocks had suggested
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.960]   But I guess I took it home but fortunately and I didn't even know I had this but it was holding up my puppet my Leo puppet
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.960]   Really?
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.960]   It was stuck up his butt
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   And it's been there for years I had no idea
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   There's only a few fingers left of a McCallen casks strength Sherry aged so Mike and I are having a couple of fingers
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   The bullet was full when we sat down
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.960]   And it was gonna be a
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   But there's a reason this is an old-fashioned Irish wake
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   Did you say you had Buna Haben prior to that?
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   No a Budna I think it's called
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   Oh okay
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.960]   You know A-B-U-N-D-A-H I think
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.960]   It's an Abalur
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   Abalur Abunda
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   There it is
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.960]   Abalur
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   And for those of you at home Irish wake is not a tax scheme used by
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   (laughter)
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   Oh I won't let me look at this until I say I'm a I'm over 18 so let me just make up a birthday
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   And yeah this is it the casks strength I'm only drinking casks strength now because you get drunk fast
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.960]   You've transitioned from life to the casks strength
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.960]   But this was a recommendation from Richard Campbell and so that's what I'm drinking
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.960]   But this is but this McCallen is actually I would say as good if not better
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.960]   It's certainly the best website I've ever seen out of a whiskey
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.960]   Pravere?
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.960]   Yeah
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.960]   Pretty nice
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   You need to see the McCallen site
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.960]   Oh really?
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   You like the McCallen's? I like the McCallen
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   I love the McCallen, I love it
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   15 and 18
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.960]   I was gonna say I've never had this before but apparently but the evidence completely to the contrary
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   I don't remember
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.960]   I just don't remember
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   It's been stuck up a puppet's butt for the last ten years
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   I don't know, I don't know when we got this
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   That bottle could talk
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   It's aged in the puppet and it's delicious
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   Yes
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   It's delicious
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.960]   Anyway we're having a little bit of a wake
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   Because yesterday was the end of the line for about 20 different Google products
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   Yes
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.960]   It is so sad in box
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.960]   But the big one and really I think from Mike Elgin's point of view
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   The probably the one the most mourn is Google Plus
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.960]   Early in the day yesterday we went there and it said we're shutting down
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   But it was still around
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.960]   Later in the day Google Plus is no longer available
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.960]   It is, I mean this is the page you get and it's sad
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.960]   I did download all my stuff
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.960]   So did I?
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.960]   Hoping there'd be something of use in there, I doubt there is
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.960]   But at least I have it
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.960]   There was a lot, it was almost four and a half gigabytes of stuff
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.960]   Yeah, I had a ton and
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.960]   You know, well you use this in place of your blog for a while
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.960]   In place of everything, so back in the day 2011 I gave up
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.960]   I think I counted on 12, 13, 14 services
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   Including my blog, various social sites, a bunch of stuff
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.960]   And I said I'm just going to use Google Plus forever
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   And then it was awesome for about three years or so
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   And then after a while Google Plus kind of fell apart
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   And it wasn't what it used to be
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.960]   And I started using other services, but there was three years where I used exactly one service
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   Did you, were you Google Plus or two?
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.960]   He was
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.960]   I loved Google Plus
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.960]   Because as a photographer there, and Trey Reklev, if you say this too, there's nowhere better to show you
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   To show, to share your photos
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   Nobody remembers this, but back in the back in between 2011, 2014, 15
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.960]   Facebook photos were just disastrously horrible
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.960]   They squeezed them
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   Right, and that's why photographers loved it
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   Because Instagram, the pictures were all square then, and low quality, look small, couldn't share them
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   And then Google Plus had these, like, they looked like full quality photos
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.960]   And so, eventually and grudgingly Facebook improved their photos
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.960]   But it took something like Google Plus to make them do it
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   Yeah, was it photo sharing for you?
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.960]   It was the...
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   It was photos and it was the community
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.960]   I've met so many awesome people over Google Plus that I've never heard of
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.960]   It's just regular Joe's like myself
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.960]   And I'm still in touch with them today
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   Now, granted, 90% of them have no use for the world of Twitter or Facebook or anything like that
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.960]   But every now and then they pop in the Twitter to say hello
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   And just keep up with each other, you know
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   I really enjoyed the community over there
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   And I enjoyed the whole photo aspect of it until they started screwing it up
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.960]   Yep, and photo editing on Google Plus used to be better
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.960]   Than the current editing is on Google Photos
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   And the other thing is that...
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   And most active users will tell you, will confirm this
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.960]   But it was the only social network that most of us ever used
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   Where you would make real friends and get together with those friends in real life
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.960]   So for example, the last hurdle, I did a blog post about this
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.960]   My last hurdle, hang out in real life
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.960]   Was a week and a half ago in Mexico
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.960]   Dude that I've been interacting with here and there on Google Plus for years and years
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.960]   Invited me to his house in Kornavaka
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960]   Wow
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.960]   We hung out with this family for like the weekend
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.960]   We took a road trip, we drank polke
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.960]   And by the side of the road we ate crickets and armadillo together
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.960]   Seriously
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   That was the last hurdle for me
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.960]   Because that's the kind of thing that Google Plus used to enable you to do
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   Is meet people all over the world
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   With whom you share various interests and become friends
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.960]   And it really worked for that aspect
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:25.960]   Speaking of hangouts, I remember Baratundi Thurston during his book tour, if you will
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   And he was doing a little hangout on air and decided, you know what?
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.960]   I'm just gonna let people join in
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   And somehow he had me pop into his hangout
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.960]   And it was one of the best experiences for me
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.960]   I can't say that for him, but just be able to chat with him and tell him who I was
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   What I was doing, my endeavors and all of that good stuff
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.960]   It was great and to this day
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.960]   I'm still in touch with Mr Thurston
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   You know, we became bonded after that
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   I did a hangout once that lasted 12 or 13 hours I think
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.960]   And I was actually, I drove from Silicon Valley to Santa Barbara, California
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.960]   And kept it going the whole way
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.960]   And the way that I did that was I started it with the
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.960]   The camera was on an apple in my house in Silicon Valley
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   And then I joined it with it
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.960]   So there's no way I could show you Google Plus
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   Except that there is still a YouTube channel of Google Plus
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.960]   And so people who don't remember how great this was
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.960]   Go ahead, keep going Mike, I didn't mean it a replica
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.960]   No, no, no, I just, so I had a camera pointed at an apple, a physical apple
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.960]   And I joined separately on the same account
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.960]   And a bunch of people were coming and going and the thing lasted for many many hours
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   And what's great is every time the apple talked it would go full screen
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.960]   Exactly, exactly, yeah, yes, but unfortunately that apple won a 33% of all the proceeds
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.960]   So I should have gone after a while
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   We used Google Plus for shows, we used it for sharing, we had Google Plus pages
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   If you're looking at the layout on our video right now
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.960]   Again, thank goodness they're all still logo
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   Yeah, I think Google probably will take all these videos down
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   But let's see, let me show you some more Google Plus videos
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.960]   Because they still have a Google Plus page with a lot of how-to videos on it
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.960]   It is kind of nostalgic to look at this
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:23.960]   What did they do wrong? Because you know, honestly, I thought Google Plus was exactly what a social network should be
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.960]   So my theory...
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   You're talking didn't want to walk
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.960]   Yeah, well my theory is that what they get wrong in all of these shutdowns
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.960]   Is they don't value their most passionate users higher than their average users
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.960]   And so I was listening to all about Android, I think it was
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   And they were talking and I think it was Flo was saying that
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   You know, what they're doing really benefits the general users
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   It's just bothers those of us who are early adopters, etc
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   My view, and it's a good point, but my view is that they really should value their passionate users more than their average users
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   Every other media business, and I would submit that in this case it's kind of like a media business
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.960]   Treats it's... they call them P1 listeners
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.960]   Treats it's most avid listeners as more important because they're the bellwethers
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   They're the ones who influence others, they're the ones who make something grow
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.960]   And those...
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960]   You need that people
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.960]   Yeah, they're the ones who care
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.960]   And so those are the ones you want to push
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   They're the ones who own and control podcast networks
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.960]   And so...
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   Yeah, but...
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   So when you say they didn't walk the walk, what do you mean by that?
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.960]   I was part of a couple different communities and one of them was a Google hosted community
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.960]   And they always thought about having this improvement and that improvement
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   You're talking about the create plus or whatever it's called?
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.960]   And create... it's create something
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.960]   Create something?
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.960]   Yeah, that sounds right
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.960]   And I get all of these emails and messages about this and that
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   And none of it ever happened, especially when it came to controlling spam
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.960]   You know, I'm not a big account, if you will
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   I didn't have millions of followers and things like that
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.960]   And it was a challenge for me to just manage going through to spam notifications
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   And turning this off and turning that off and it just got...
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.960]   And it did get worse and worse, I mean, it wasn't a big problem early on
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.960]   But as Google+ became abandoned, it became overrun with spam
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   The quality went way down, the junk went way up
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.960]   Isn't that kind of inevitable though for social networks that they're fun
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   When it's just you and your friends and as soon as everybody else arrives
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   I can't say that because me being the big introvert that I am, I don't really meet a lot of people
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   So I don't have a ton of friends, if you will
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.960]   But Google+ connected me to thousands of people
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:55.960]   And it's sort of crazy that I can say that I would recognize a couple hundred different names
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.960]   Because I saw them so regularly in my feed as engaging every single day
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   Yeah, and the other thing is that we live in an age where one of our biggest problems
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   Politically and socially is that we're all in our own little worlds
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.960]   And we're getting the point where we can't relate to people in other countries or other political perspectives
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:17.960]   And Google+ was the only social network where you're constantly meeting people from all over the world
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.960]   In Facebook, how many Pakistani people have you met in Facebook that have become your friends?
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:27.960]   You know what I mean, it doesn't happen, Facebook keeps you fenced in to your own existing world
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.960]   Whereas Google+ was all based on interests
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.960]   And so like what Ant was saying, you'd be having conversations with 30 people
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.960]   None of them were from the US
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.960]   And most of whom were became familiar to you because they were constantly engaging in conversations with you
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   And stuff like that was just really a unique social network
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   It also is, and maybe this is just me, but I think it's beautiful
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.960]   I think it's a good design
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.960]   It didn't play as well on mobile, is that part of the problem?
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:02.960]   It came to us five years ago when mobile was just beginning to rise
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.960]   This is really best on desktop I think
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:12.960]   I started having performance issues about two years ago on mobile and on the desktop service
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:18.960]   It was just not refreshing and not loading, not seeing things that was two days old
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.960]   Or several hours old, so I was always behind
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.960]   And when I mentioned this to the support people, as far as leave feedback or whatever
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   It went nowhere, it just continued
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.960]   And then when my images started looking like 8-bit images, I was done
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   So you think they abandoned it early on?
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.960]   So the history of Google+ is that Vic Gundotra, who was at the time, was, I think, a vice president of Google
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.960]   Really lobbied hard, and we've read stories from people
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   That this was Vic's baby, and he got everybody enrolled
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   In fact, at one point, your bonus at Google, no matter what division you were in, was based on your social
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.960]   About how well you'd integrated social into your product
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.960]   I started in 2011, that was Larry Page's first edict when he became this yo
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.960]   And Vic was Larry's fair-haired boy
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.960]   That's right
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   And Larry bought into it, and so Google+ was a very, was like the number one initiative from Google for about a year
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:27.960]   I have a theory about what happened, so my theory is that Vic Gundotra was not culturally a good fit for Google
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   It's gone, because he understood people
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:38.960]   And this was just like, he was more of an apple kind of person, even though his background was actually Microsoft
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:45.960]   But he was a very warm people person who really worked hard, he was very engaging, very charismatic
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   And Google, they don't have time for that, you know what I mean?
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.960]   So I think there was a war between Vic Gundotra and Sundar Prachai that probably raged the whole time
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   That Vic was there doing his Google
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   And Sundar won
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   And Sundar won, and so I think that as soon as Sundar won, they're like, okay, we're deprioritizing this
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:13.960]   It was political things that Ant mentioned, this is essentially moving human and compute resources off of Google+ and using them for other things
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   And then Sundar Prachai himself, his last Google+ post, I think was 2016, right?
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   And he was using Twitter, like how do you, how are you the CEO of a company that owns a social network
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:34.960]   And you'd use the competitor social network, it'd be like Mark Zuckerberg ignoring Facebook and instead doing everything on Twitter
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.960]   There were also issues, much like Microsoft's in fighting issues with different teams
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.960]   I remember there was a long Twitter thread a few months ago by somebody who was on one of the teams
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.960]   Who said that the Gmail people wouldn't refuse to integrate the features from Google+ in
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.960]   Because they had something similar and they didn't want to, and this was something that almost killed Microsoft
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:03.960]   Because it doesn't, it doesn't, Windows team and Office team and fighting any other teams
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   Google+ wasn't perfect, circles might have been a bad idea
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.960]   But on the other hand, the thing that really is frustrating is things like Picasa, which Google bought
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   Then turn into Google photos eventually, all the best features were migrated to Google+ because Google's thinking, well, this is our future
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:30.960]   And then they've disappeared now because it wasn't the future, it was a dead-end road and they just sent them off into the bit bucket
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:38.960]   Hangouts, which at the time was the chat interface for Google+ has really struggled since
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.960]   President Obama did Hangouts
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   Remember that? Trey Radcliffe, we had a show that was Trey doing Hangouts
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.960]   It was easy for him to do, he was in New Zealand already, but it was on our network
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.960]   Because he could do it from New Zealand, other people could join him, he'd had the six people
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   When Hangouts first started, I had a number of different panels via Hangouts
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   I used to love watching that show
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.960]   Trey's show, yeah
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   So, I think that was that you, Mike, or just somebody that looks like you?
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.960]   That one was just somebody that looked like me, actually
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.960]   A middle-aged guy with a gray-air village guy?
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   It could be both of them
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   It's generic, I think they're using that this person does not exist again generation to generate these people
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.960]   Some of the things persist, those little thumb icons, those are still around in Hangouts
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.960]   But most of this stuff just went down the tube
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:38.960]   I just can't imagine, the only explanation for killing it is politics, revenge, something like, something internal, something Microsoft-ian
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.960]   Remember back in the old days of Microsoft, every Microsoft division was at war with every other division?
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:51.960]   And it really harmed them during the bomber years and I think that they've gotten better to a certain extent because they've overcome that to a certain extent
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.960]   Because there's no reason not to keep Google+ going, like thrilled the most passionate
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   It's a really interesting point, why kill it, how much could that have cost them to keep it going?
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.960]   Exactly, it could be the laboratory for all kinds of new ideas
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.960]   This thing that Aunt Pruitt mentioned a minute ago, the Create+ community or whatever it was called
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.960]   Was the worst idea you could imagine
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.960]   Like I thought that as a policy, that whole program was all about harming Google+
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:25.960]   Because what they did was, they personally reached out to people like Aunt Pruitt and said, "Okay, you're a content creator, you create all this great content for Google+
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   We're going to create a closed community just for people like you."
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.960]   And so they took the most creative, productive people and they gave them a place to post things where nobody could see it
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   Why would you do that?
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.960]   Why would you?
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   You want those people posting in public and evangelizing the network?
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.960]   And that's what I was doing, I was just double posting
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.960]   I would just go in there occasionally and complaining about it and then leaving
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.960]   Here's another example, this was Google+ Events
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.960]   Which you would put publicize an event with invitations
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.960]   And then everybody who was at the event could turn on party mode
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   And the pictures from the event would all be shared into a Google+ event thread
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.960]   This would kill today, if somebody announced that today, it would kill
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.960]   There are young people watching the show right now that didn't ever see that feature
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   And are now saying, "Wow, really? That's amazing, I want that."
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.960]   It's like crazy.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.960]   I started my smartphone photographers community on Google+
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   And having features like that was just, "Oh, it was great for content."
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.960]   It was so easy and it was all at the click of a button
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.960]   Now I'm just getting angry.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.960]   Now I'm just mad.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.960]   I need a drink.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.960]   This is why we broke out the whiskey.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.960]   Doesn't this hurt Google that they keep doing this to stuff?
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.960]   Honestly, this...
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.960]   Not one you worried about is Adworks?
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:57.960]   You know, Major League Baseball, it's almost 20 years ago now, had a strike
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.960]   And the season was canceled and they lost part of another season
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.960]   And for me, baseball never was as good again.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.960]   I never...I was a huge fan.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.960]   I went to 40 or 50 games a year before the strike.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.960]   I maybe won the season since the strike and I don't watch it on TV.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.960]   This reminds me of that because, yeah, this isn't what all the Google does, but this broke my heart.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   And honestly, I have to think this hurts Google.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.960]   I understand Ruth Porret, their CFO, is looking at divisions saying, "It doesn't make money.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.960]   Cut it, cut it, cut it."
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   That's good business.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   But you also have to recognize the social role, especially a company like Google plays,
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   and acknowledge that.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.960]   And the damage this does to the company, I think, is significant.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.960]   Yep.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   They did this on small projects for many, many years.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   There are graveyards and so on that show all the Google products that were killed.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   There's a really good one that came out recently.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   Yeah, we were showing it a couple of weeks ago, the Google graveyard.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.960]   But when they killed Reader, that's when you first really started hearing people.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.960]   Reader was a new one.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.960]   Yeah, that was the first big one that people were really passionate about.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.960]   These are live hangouts like we were talking about.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   And then it was one thing after another.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.960]   And now it's like a bloodbath this week of all kinds of things that are being killed.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   April 2nd was like the night of long knives.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.960]   It's still night of long knives.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   I think a challenge they had was trying to answer the question that I got every single time
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.960]   I mentioned Google Plus.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   Well, who's over there that I know?
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.960]   Well, that's true of all social networks.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:45.960]   I'm on a number of attempts to replace proprietary social networks with open federated networks.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   So, mast it on instead of Twitter.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.760]   Pixel Fed instead of Instagram, which I really like.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.680]   But there's no one there.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.960]   As journalists, like we kind of have to be on Twitter because that's like crack cocaine.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.960]   I know you don't.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.960]   I cannot do it.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   I can't bring myself to do it.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.000]   Yeah, but I just, you know, for me, I'm on Twitter because I just, you know, I compulsively
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.960]   have to just blurt something out sometimes.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.480]   And so I do it on Twitter.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.480]   It's great for that.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.720]   But it's just the place to do it.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.840]   But it's like you say, like I get, you know, 100 people a week saying, are you going to
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.840]   go on We Me?
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.400]   Are you going to go on Plus Spora?
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.320]   You're going to go, you know, you're going to try LinkedIn as a social network.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.560]   I can't be on all of them.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.440]   And if I'm on any one of them, it's like a tiny community.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.840]   So I'm just doing what you're doing, Leo.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.840]   I'm mostly focusing on the blog.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.360]   We really, this is, we really lost something I'm sad to say.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.360]   And it's not just Google Plus.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.360]   Inbox.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.080]   And the interview used that I didn't, but I kind of got off Gmail.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   I never used it.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:55.200]   But I am glad to see some of the features slide on over into Gmail because I'm not an
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.200]   inbox zero kind of guy.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.240]   So inbox just never really worked for me.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.400]   But it's nice seeing stuff like that snooze feature and other things like that popping
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.880]   up inside of Gmail.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   It's easier.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.880]   Yep.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.560]   And they're going to be adding a feature pretty soon where you can schedule email.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:20.000]   So when you launch a new email, you can send this out next month at Tuesday at three o'clock.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   That's going to be pretty cool.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   But that's awesome.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of work on it.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   It's like that guy after World War II on the Japanese islands.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Nobody defending the island.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Nobody told them the war.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Then we told them the wars over.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Project Tango, saved to Google Chrome extension.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Google goggles, glass OS, spaces.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And I'll point out that a third of these products were going to be the future of all of them.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Project era.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Now, I was-- that's the one where it was the modular smartphone.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I didn't think highly of it, but a lot of people thought, oh, this is what you want.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Because you add features to your phone as you need them.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   It was a Motorola project.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Google bought it.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Didn't they now so going to distribute that from Puerto Rican taco trucks or something like that?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Was that all right?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Yeah, but that was made in Puerto Rico, I think.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Gone.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   I was like looking for flights.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   I was going to go.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Google now.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Remember Google now?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   At the time, I thought that was going to be the-- that was it.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   It was over.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   That was the next big thing.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   We still have remnants of that right now though, right?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Yeah, sort of.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   If you go to the Google app, it's a little bit of Google News.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   It's a little bit of Google now.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   It's not anything.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   And that's really the problem.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   It's not anything.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   It's just a thing.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.600]   And again, nobody's going to invest in any of this if you can't count on Google to keep
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   it around.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.640]   I think Google-- the only thing that could save Google's reputation at this point is
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.960]   if they had a new policy and if Google, if you're listening and I hope you are, every
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:17.800]   time you launch a new service, you should essentially promise that you won't kill it
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.120]   for at least a certain amount of time.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.560]   So like, for example, you launch a new service and you should say, okay, we're not going
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.000]   to kill this till 2030.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.960]   And if they change their mind later and want to kill it even later than that, they should
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.960]   update that.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.200]   Everything should have a, we promise we won't kill it by this date.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.240]   And then people could look at that and go, okay, I'm going to use it because I still
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.840]   wouldn't because I know they're going to kill it in five years.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.840]   It was killed at the program.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.800]   So it's like, I'm not going to put any energy into that.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.880]   Oh, man.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.160]   This list is-- I need a drink.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.640]   This is, you know, to a certain extent that the new Yahoo because I remember for years,
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.400]   you'd learn about Yahoo products when they canceled it.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.400]   You're like, wow, that sounds incredible.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.400]   All right.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   Yeah, I heard it.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   Oh, Yahoo's doing that?
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   No, they're not.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.600]   No, they just, they bought it, they ignored it.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.440]   Now they're killing it.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.240]   So what lessons, what have we learned?
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.760]   I mean, here's a piece from Adweek.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:19.440]   I don't exactly think Adweek knows what we learned from the shutdown of Google+, but
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:25.960]   the aim according to Vikkundotra was to transform Google into a social destination
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.880]   at a level and scale, never previously attempted.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.560]   Now remember the climate of the time was Facebook is eating our lunch that web search
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.400]   has no future.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:42.440]   The social graph is going, that Facebook's using for search is going to eat us alive.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.440]   We've got to do something.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.400]   Now the irony is Facebook's social graph search died shortly after they launched it.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:54.040]   Facebook's as bad as Google, right, in that regard.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:59.000]   Mark Zuckerberg reportedly considered Google+ to be an existential threat.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.800]   He declared an internal lockdown.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.040]   No one can leave until we can come up with a way to effectively counter it.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.040]   Right.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:14.880]   I wonder if those heady days, basically Eric Schmidt, 2010, I think it was, said that articulated
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.920]   Google's social strategy to counter the Facebook threat.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.280]   And he basically said, "We're going to build social into everything."
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.160]   So if you recall Google Reader before they killed it, you could suddenly share.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.640]   You could get algorithmic sorting of your feed and all this horrible stuff that doesn't
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.440]   belong in an RSS reader.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:38.080]   And this policy of like, everybody's bonuses are tied to social actually was implemented
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.880]   when that was the policy, when you're going to have an inside out social network with
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.640]   social built into everything.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.200]   The Condotras apparently won the day, won the argument and said, "No, we need an actual
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:53.680]   destination and we're, instead of everything having social, everything is going to be built
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.000]   into or supported by our social networks."
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.600]   So they forcibly shoehorned in YouTube and all these other things.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.760]   And that became the new policy.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.760]   And I think that was the right policy actually.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.760]   I thought it was, I think there were two of them.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.400]   From a revenue point of view it was.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:19.200]   So from just like give your most passionate users a place to go and evangelize your products
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.200]   other than Facebook.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.680]   It's like, give your passionate users a playground where they can do all this amazing Google-y
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:31.040]   stuff and play with AI, interact with each other and post amazing pictures and post amazing
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.200]   pictures from the phones that you guys are selling.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.760]   There's a lot of promotional benefit to having a place.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.200]   Every time there's a Google announcement they used to announce them on Google+ and everybody
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.600]   would go to Google+ and comment on Google's announcements.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.520]   Individual engineers were announcing different products.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.600]   Well that was the best thing about Google+ if you want to talk to somebody at Google,
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   they were there.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.600]   They were there.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   That was cool.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.720]   In fact that was the kind of the wrap on Google+ was well, the only people there really
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.360]   are the Google, Googleers themselves but that's not bad.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.200]   There were two kinds of complaints about Google+.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.920]   This is one of the problems with the network structurally.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.520]   And Pruitt said, "I couldn't keep up.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.200]   It was a fire hose of activity."
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.760]   And then other people would be like, "Nothing's happening.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.000]   There is no activity."
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   So it was one or the other.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.960]   Nobody had the right amount of activity on their feed-man.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.160]   And circles didn't really do the right thing.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.160]   Circles were too confusing.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.320]   I think Google overestimated the patience of the...
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.320]   Yeah, you had spent a lot of energy to cultivate and create your circles.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.320]   And then the other thing Google did wrong and they did it with Google+ first and then
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.920]   they did it with circles which was, "Your contact list now is populated by all these
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   circles."
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.480]   I still have birth dates of people that I followed in Google+ circles.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.960]   I don't care about their birth date.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.960]   I'm trying to figure that out.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.160]   I was like, "Why do I have this person's skin?"
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.720]   Because this is circles.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.720]   There you circle.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.360]   Actually, I think Marianne Riedel in ad week has one...
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.440]   I kind of got it right.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.680]   He says, or he says, "In many ways Google+ was a startup.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.400]   It lacked the heart of a founder, the ultimate product owner, the caretaker who seriously
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.840]   invested in the product and fights endlessly on its behalf."
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.000]   That's what Vic did in the early days but once he left...
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   He got rid of him.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   He got rid of him.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.880]   He got political battle.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.800]   It's like Game of Thrones in there.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   You know?
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.520]   And he's like Roger Robert Baratheon, the crazy king.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.520]   He got kicked out.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.600]   He got his head chopped off.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:33.200]   And now, while Google may be breathing a collective sigh of relief with the Google+ shutdown,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.200]   Google's biggest loss...
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.800]   And this is Marianne Riedel writing.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.640]   She is the CEO and founder of Pashpost.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.280]   So I think she's really right on actually now that I've read this.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:47.600]   Google's biggest loss is one the company may never have internalized was theirs to lose.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:54.000]   The hard one, heartfelt trust of millions of community members who used Google+...
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.680]   That loss, more than anything, speaks directly to how the Google+ debacle came about and
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.640]   why it's displaced community members.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   Maybe I don't agree with this.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.560]   Well, ultimately, be better off on new platforms that pay a high premium.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.080]   It plays a high premium on what it means to value and serve that trust.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.080]   I don't know who that is.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.080]   It's not Twitter.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.080]   It's not Facebook.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.080]   Well, there is no place...
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   There is nowhere.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.080]   But she makes...
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:21.720]   That's a similar point to one that I've made as well, which is that if you keep destroying
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:27.280]   the platforms that you have gotten your most passionate users to embrace, they will find
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.680]   somebody else's platform to love.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.520]   In the world of social, I don't know what that is.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.840]   Facebook is unlovable.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:40.480]   But like in other things, in email, for example, people who are super invested in inbox, they're
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.120]   going to say screw Gmail.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.760]   In fact, later in the show, I'll be talking about...
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.760]   Screwing Gmail?
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.760]   Screwing Gmail.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.680]   I'm talking about that.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.400]   I'm going to talk about a company that's basically saying, "This is our opportunity to steal Google
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.920]   users off of Gmail."
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   Good.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.400]   Rana Madio, R's Technica, Google's constant brand...
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.160]   I'm sorry, product showdowns are damaging its brand.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.880]   Please, just stop closing things, he writes.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.040]   Google's product support has become a joke and the company should be very concerned.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.800]   He also mentions Google Fiber.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.840]   Allowing?
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.280]   I mean, this has been a bloodbath this year.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:32.080]   So he says Google's products require trust and investment, and that's exactly what you're
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   not getting right now.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:38.360]   You're getting a kind of a ruthless picture of Google that it survives or it dies, and
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.560]   it does that quickly.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:46.160]   This to me is likely to be a classic problem of overly focusing on the measurable.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.400]   So they can see how much it costs to run Google+, and inbox.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.800]   They're very data-driven, aren't they?
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:57.120]   But the unmeasurables are how millions of people feel about Google, how much trust is
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.120]   out there.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.120]   You can't measure that.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.840]   You can do a survey or whatever, but you can't really measure what's going on in the
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.640]   minds of developers coming out of the universities and thinking, "Well, which platform should
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.640]   I embrace?
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.400]   Should it be Google's or some competitor?"
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:19.800]   And you can't measure some student who's going to grow up and write the alternative to Google's
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:25.240]   search and just crush Google, which that person could have been a Google evangelist, but they've
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.240]   like, "You can't measure any of that stuff."
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.240]   And so I think that's why you need a visionary founder.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.680]   I mean, for example, Google+ was the stuff of visionary founders.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:38.720]   The reason there were hangouts allowed you to talk to 10 people simultaneously is because
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.320]   the individual person of Larry Page says, "I want 10."
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   They like the search.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.320]   Okay, yes.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.440]   And that's why Apple used to be great, because Steve Jobs didn't like the color blue on their
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:52.480]   Mac, and they said, "Yes, we'll change it by tomorrow," or whatever it was.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:58.640]   And you need that kind of visionary founder who has a gut feel for the zeitgeist of the
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.160]   community and gives them what they want.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:07.320]   Right now, it seems like Google management is run by bean counters.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.200]   I would say this is an existential threat to Google because with people like Elizabeth
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.840]   Warren, and now I think there's a drumbeat, let's say, "Break up Google."
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.640]   There's nobody, there aren't fans to say, "No."
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.280]   There's nobody who says, "Oh, no, we got to save this."
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.280]   Ron makes the point that a lot of people had made, that this is a structural problem with
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.000]   the way Google works.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.800]   He says, "Google's strategy of having multiple teams throw things against the wall to see
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:39.080]   what sticks leads to lots and lots of products and services launching all the time, all with
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:43.240]   varying levels of quality, integration with other Google products and varying lifetimes."
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:47.320]   It also leads to lots and lots of product cancellations.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.640]   Google's in love with creating new stuff.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.280]   They're not in love with maintaining existing stuff.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.440]   That's always been the wrap.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.480]   Now, question for you guys.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:05.360]   What if Google was just strictly search, nothing to do with Android phones or anything like
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   that?
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.160]   What if they were just strictly search?
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.680]   Would they still be the healthy, strong company that they are today?
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.560]   I don't know.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:21.240]   To a certain extent, and this is not exactly to your question, but that's what Google
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.720]   Plus was, actually.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.720]   I've made the case that--
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.880]   It was a social search.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.120]   It was a search engine for YouTube.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.480]   It was a search engine for all social content.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.720]   It was a search engine for news.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.400]   It was a search engine for everything.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.400]   Everything was based on search.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:41.240]   If I followed Ant Pruitt on Google Plus, that was just a search for his name.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.840]   It was a saved search.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.840]   Exactly.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.840]   Exactly.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.760]   Because everything was integrated into Google Plus, they basically took the whole world
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:56.080]   and put it into a search engine, and they themselves said all the top brass that involve
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.320]   a Google Plus said, this is not the future of social.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.200]   This is the future of Google.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:05.040]   They implied that in the future, there would just be Google Plus, and that would be your
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.040]   everything.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:11.760]   It would basically be a search engine where you can post directly the search engine.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.720]   That doesn't answer your question.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.320]   To answer your question, I think they would be successful as a search company, but they
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.000]   wouldn't have the power that they do.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.280]   Which is the point for people like Elizabeth Warren.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.960]   Search plus ad sales.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   Search plus ads.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.440]   They go together.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:30.520]   The reason they created Android is because they wanted people to be using Google in many,
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.200]   many ways.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.520]   They wanted a billion phones in a billion pockets.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.880]   It just expanded their reach for ads and search.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.280]   But I don't think they should own YouTube.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.600]   I don't think they should be doing social stuff.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.040]   I think they should be making.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.320]   They would be just as dominant if all they did was search, wouldn't they?
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.000]   They'd still be the number one search engine.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.080]   I think they'd be just as dominant in search.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.400]   YouTube gives them enormous reach and power.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.400]   And troubles.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.400]   Yes.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:06.680]   In fact, later on, we'll see the kinds of troubles, and they're not handling them well.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:10.400]   I don't like it, and the EU doesn't like it because Google, whether you believe it or
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:17.040]   not, is tempted to raise the search results of its own products, right?
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.280]   The EU dinged them for shopping.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.280]   YouTube's not far behind.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.960]   If you search for anything, there's a YouTube video at the top of the page for it.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:31.120]   Now maybe Google says what users want, but I don't think it's seemingly.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.480]   In fact, Larry Page, when he wrote the first paper and delivered the first paper about
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.040]   Google, was very clear.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.520]   He said we shouldn't have any advertising because whether you mean to or not, the selling of
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.560]   advertising will take the search results.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.960]   And acquiring all these other side products has absolutely done that.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:55.240]   So I think, and honestly, I'm not sure I say you should break up Google.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.760]   I don't know if that's the right answer, but if Google were just a search plus advertising
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.600]   company, their revenue would be cut a little bit, although the vast majority of their revenues
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.080]   from search.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.520]   And more importantly, I think they'd be a better search engine, a more trustworthy search engine.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.520]   Yep.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.040]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.000]   You look at some people are really good at doing one thing.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.560]   And it sort of diminishes their credibility when they start dabbling into other things
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.560]   in multitasking.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.440]   And I guess it sort of depends on the case and depends on the person.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.080]   But I just thought about that.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:37.720]   So what if they only worried about search and the actual ad space that they sell in search
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.520]   because everybody uses Google to look up stuff?
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.960]   Sorry, Bing.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.520]   Not everybody uses you.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.560]   Interestingly now with Google Stadia, which they've announced but not launched, I mean,
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.080]   that's the thing that now that I remember, at least I said, well, I'm not going to spend
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:57.480]   any energy on Google Stadia because it's just going to be killed in six months or whatever.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.320]   And I bet you that's a very.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:04.000]   Yeah, that's got to be kind of.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.600]   And really the people that Stadia has to win over first are developers, game developers.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.600]   Right.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.320]   Do you think game developers are thinking, oh, yeah, this is going to be a great opportunity.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.880]   Google's going all in on streaming gaming.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.920]   No, they're going to go to a Sony.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.920]   They're going to go to Microsoft.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.520]   They're going to go people game and don't kill every product they'd invent.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.520]   Absolutely.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.520]   And people think gaming is frivolous.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.720]   Yeah, people think gaming is frivolous.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.720]   Because you're a developer.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   It's everything.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:35.000]   It's a lifetime commitment to becoming a developer for a specific platform because it takes years,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.040]   especially with more sophisticated gaming and VR coming online.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.040]   It's a major.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.760]   I mean, I can switch email.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.040]   I'm going to make a weird prediction.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.040]   We'll see if I'm right.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.960]   I bet Stadia never launches.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.960]   Wow.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.960]   Huh.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   Because it's a non-starter.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.560]   Well, actually, there were previous game initiatives that they never launched.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.000]   They said they were going to launch one around Google+.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   They announced it at Google I/O.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.480]   And they're like, oh, we're going to have this whole thing.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.200]   And it's going to be the Play Store and Google+ is where everything's going to happen.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.320]   And you're going to watch the games.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.000]   And they even mentioned that gaming has become a spectator sport.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.560]   So everybody wants to watch it and blah, blah, blah.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.560]   And everybody got excited.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.560]   Everybody forgot about it.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.560]   And then they never launched it.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.280]   All Google did with the Stadia announcement is provide a nice, fat target for Microsoft,
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.640]   Sony, and Amazon to aim at it, E3.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:25.440]   And you're going to see all three of them respond with more games, more exclusives,
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.760]   better thought out plans.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.760]   And I bet you Stadia never launched.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.320]   And you just eat Google's lunch.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.320]   It's just not going to launch.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.480]   No developer is going to write a game for it.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.600]   And Apple, let's not forget Apple Arcade.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.480]   A billion phones, a billion.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.400]   They're in a billion pockets, y'all, as Oprah said.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:46.200]   How many pockets is Google's Stadia in?
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.480]   You have an Android TV device, right?
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.480]   No.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.480]   That's a good idea.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.160]   I'm the only person that does.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.360]   I have a shield.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   Guess what?
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.360]   You know what's on the shield?
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.480]   Geforce now.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.480]   It does the same thing now.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.280]   Stadia, it does just come to me now.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.200]   The Stadia, I was all excited.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.600]   I will watch you in the stage.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.080]   We all do this reality.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.640]   Distortion field at these keynotes.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.640]   It looks great.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   This is all.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.280]   Stadia will never launch.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.600]   And if it does, it'll be killed almost instantly because I wasn't excited because I think about
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   bandwidth.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.600]   Right.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.520]   I'm here in the south where there's a lot of rural areas.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.640]   I can't even say that word.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.640]   I'm so country.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.640]   People say rural juror.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.080]   And by country, you mean it's drunk because it's been drinking.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.840]   And people's internet is just not going to be fast enough in my opinion.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.280]   They were talking about, "Oh, we're going to have all these great servers, Ted and
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.680]   Teraflops, blah, blah, blah."
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:42.480]   They didn't mention that frayed line going from their fancy, shiny servers to my house.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.520]   In those multiplayer games that they were demoing, latency is the only thing.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.520]   I mean, it's everything.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.000]   You can't have a tenth of a second delay.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   It's fatal.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   Right.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.800]   That's my prediction for the week.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.640]   Teraflop predictions, I'm always wrong.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.680]   So in fact, I'm guaranteeing it'll launch by saying that.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   And Pruitt is here.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.440]   He is always welcome on this show.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.680]   Bring your whiskey.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.900]   Bring your ants.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.920]   And Pruitt from Tech Republic and many other places love having you on the show.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.920]   Thank you for being here.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:20.640]   Mike Elgin, who spends more money on airplane tickets than he does on anything else.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:26.280]   He's back in town after hugely successful Gastro Nomad Tour of Mexico City.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.280]   What's next?
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.280]   It was fantastic.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   We're doing two-week experience in Morocco.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.680]   So we're going to do Fez Marrakesh.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.400]   We're going to go into the Sahara.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.040]   We're going to Esawiro, which is a beach town.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.800]   We're going to the Shefshauan, Blue Village of Shefshauan.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.200]   I actually love Morocco.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.040]   We were in Tangier a couple of months ago.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.600]   Lisa and I both fell in love with it.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.600]   It's beautiful.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:53.600]   And the last year is a very unique city, but there are elements of it that are very universally
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.600]   Moroccan.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.960]   It's such a cool country.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.240]   It's just such a beautiful country.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.240]   And the food?
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.240]   And the architecture?
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.040]   The history of Morocco is fascinating.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.040]   It really is.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.880]   And so we're going to spend a lot of time.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   Not here, but originally.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.880]   Berber.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.880]   Berber, right.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.040]   There are lots and lots of Berber tribes.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:15.320]   The Berber people in Morocco that I've met are just like the most wonderful people.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   You'll ever meet.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.320]   Morocco's in general are very friendly.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.640]   Berber's are very cool people.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.160]   So we're going to be doing that shortly.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.760]   And we're leaving Sunday to go back to Morocco to finish the preparation of it.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.360]   The only reason you ever come on this show is because you have a grandchild in the South
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.360]   Bay.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.360]   I know the truth.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.920]   I know the real truth is true.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.200]   He has to come see his grand dog, which is our blessing.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.600]   Glad to have you.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.600]   Elgin.com.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.680]   And of course, is there room?
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.680]   Nope, sold out.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.920]   Morocco sold out.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.360]   The next Prosecco sold out.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.760]   But after that, Prosecco Provence, another Mexico City experience.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.520]   I'm just thrilled to see sold out.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.920]   To me, I'm happy for you.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.000]   It's getting to the point where people love them so much.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.080]   Yeah, I'm guessing that in a couple of years, 100% of the people who do these experiences
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.640]   will be repeats.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.440]   It kind of, that's what happened with geek cruises.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:10.240]   I used to do those geek cruises.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.400]   And over about five or 10 years, it pretty much was the same people every single time.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.000]   It's so much fun.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.200]   Once you do it once, you go, oh, that's my vacation next year.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   That's my vacation community.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.200]   Absolutely.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.200]   Yeah, it's a community.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.200]   I also want to give you this quickly.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.280]   This is Mexico's best coffee.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.720]   So it's a wooden box.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.720]   Yes.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.280]   Their coffee comes in a box.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.280]   Yes.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.280]   And the big.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.280]   Oh.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.280]   Wow.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.280]   Wow.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:37.040]   This shows the Mecuco Cafe.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.080]   This is one of the cafes owned by a friend Ricardo.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.000]   But it's actually, we got it at Barola Cafe.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.480]   So if you're ever in Mexico City, go to Barola Cafe.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.880]   It's the best cup for coffee.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:52.120]   So this coffee grows in a specific mountainside in southern Mexico.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:56.440]   And if you try to grow it anywhere else, it does not taste anything like this.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   Nice.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.320]   But this is like, well, blow your mind.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.320]   This is like such great coffee.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.400]   And it's an espresso roast because you know that's what I do.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   And I can't wait.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   And I'm going to put this in my new, I just got a new Breville coffee maker and I did
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   a coffee maker.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.400]   Wonderful.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.400]   But the burger, I know, and everything.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.720]   So I'm, thank you, my...
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.720]   Tastes great.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.720]   Tastes great.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.720]   Tastes of Mexico.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.720]   And all you got was a couple of fingers of the gallon.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.720]   But that's...
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.880]   I'll take a look at that.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.400]   That's how it works here at Twig.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.640]   Our show today brought to you by LastPass.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.960]   It is literally, I'm getting a new computer I mentioned tomorrow.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.240]   First thing I'll install, LastPass.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.880]   First thing I saw on any new phone, LastPass.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.360]   LastPass is my password manager.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:42.960]   And the reason I used LastPass started using it 10 years ago is I was clear that there
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.120]   were, I had to remember too many passwords.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.680]   The temptation, and I think when I started using LastPass, I was falling prey to this,
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.960]   was to use the same password or a slight variation of that everywhere.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:00.080]   We now know that is a horrific security practice because if one site gets breached, the bad
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.480]   guys now have your password and they just try it on every other site.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.600]   You can't reuse passwords.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.600]   You shouldn't have passwords.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.120]   You can remember because if it's easy to remember, it's easy to break.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.520]   It's easy to guess.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:15.440]   So what LastPass does is it generates long, strong, completely impossible to memorize
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.600]   passwords.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:20.880]   You get to provide all the parameters.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.880]   It's got punctuation.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:26.160]   They even have a couple of nice things like they don't put ambiguous characters in if
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.800]   you say so I can't have an O and a zero, which is great.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.840]   Makes it much easier for me to read them.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:37.680]   But the best part is I don't ever have to really type them or read them because LastPass also
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.920]   fills in those passwords everywhere I go.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:45.160]   And not just websites, but on iOS and Android on apps too.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.120]   So, that's why it's the first thing I install.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.360]   Install that and then as I install apps, it's a simple thing.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.360]   Just boom, boom, boom, because the passwords get filled in by LastPass.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.600]   I have no idea what any of my passwords are.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   You shouldn't.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   And I don't care.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.200]   Honestly, if you do, that's a bad sign.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.400]   Well, there's one you need to know, which is your LastPass password.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.000]   I know maybe two passwords.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.680]   After that, I shouldn't have no idea.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.280]   And it's all good.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.480]   And this is doubly true in business.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.560]   Now, I'm a LastPass premium user for years.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.920]   Actually, when I got married, we got LastPass family.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.080]   Made it easy for me to share passwords with Lisa.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:24.880]   But also, she's my designated LastPass survivor.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:29.320]   And that's important because people often become disabled or pass on without passing
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.280]   on their passwords.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:34.120]   So if anything should happen to me, Lisa will get access to my passwords.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.520]   They send you an email.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.880]   You say, if I don't respond to that email in a period of time, then you can give Lisa
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.280]   the passwords.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.840]   And that's really a great feature of LastPass families.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.360]   There's also LastPass for teams.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.680]   If you have a small business, 50 or fewer, we use LastPass Enterprise.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.840]   And in fact, we're not alone.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.040]   43,000 businesses use LastPass.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.280]   It's literally the number one most preferred password manager.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.760]   The reason businesses use it, well, because everything bad that you could do with passwords,
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.720]   their employees are doing and more.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.080]   Things you never even thought of.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.200]   Putting your passwords on Post-it notes right there on the screen.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.440]   We know that more than half of all employees share passwords.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:14.160]   And not just with other employees, with other people in the world.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:18.880]   With LastPass Enterprise, for instance, our business department doesn't even have the
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.120]   passwords to get into our bank account.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.280]   They can get in, but they never see that password.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.280]   That means they can't share it.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.280]   They can't copy it down.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.720]   I can change it anytime.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.400]   They still can get in, but they can't get the password.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:34.600]   We have folders, so all the people in the dev team, the ops team, the business team have
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.500]   shared passwords, so they have all have access to it.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.000]   There are over 100 policies in LastPass Enterprise.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.280]   Things like how strong the master password is.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.240]   We require second factor authentication as well.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.400]   And boy, they support everything.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.320]   I use a UBIC key for my last password.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.120]   I feel really safe with that.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.920]   They support Duo Security, but also Google Authenticator.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.600]   In fact, LastPass has its own authenticator.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:59.240]   I really like that because you don't have to type any letters.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.480]   It just says approver deny.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.920]   That's easy for employees.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.200]   It's free to use.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:11.160]   LastPass is really the solution that you need for your business.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.840]   You don't want to be on that headline.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.400]   Big breach affects Twit.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.440]   No, I don't want that headline.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.680]   Protect yourself with LastPass.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.880]   LastPass.com/Twit 13.5 million people use LastPass.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.800]   I've used it for more than a decade since they first started.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.040]   Steve Gibson a few years ago, I said,
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.640]   "Steve, meet Joe Seagris, the creator of LastPass.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.360]   Talk to him.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.200]   Look at his source code, see how he does it."
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.640]   Steve was very impressed.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.720]   He uses LastPass.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.200]   That's a good sign our security guy uses LastPass.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.360]   Russell has set up LastPass for the whole enterprise.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.280]   LastPass.com/Twit.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.280]   Encrypted everywhere.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.920]   Only decrypted on your device, so LastPass can't even
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:50.600]   see your passwords.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.200]   No one can see them except you.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.400]   I can go on and on and on, but really, this bottom line is,
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.560]   you need LastPass.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:57.400]   You need it for yourself.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.600]   You need it for your business.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.880]   LastPass.com/Twit.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.280]   Go there, find out how they can help you.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.400]   And please use that URL, because as much as we appreciate
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:09.520]   LastPass support, it's nice if they know you heard it here.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:14.160]   LastPass.com/Twit.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.000]   Thank you, LastPass, for doing such a great job.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   All right, enough--
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.640]   Jason Howell got me on LastPass.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.560]   Did he?
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.800]   Good.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.280]   It's easy, right?
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:23.840]   It is.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.720]   It's for people who hate passwords, not who people love them.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.480]   It's like for people who never want to deal with again.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.240]   And I use-- one of the things LastPass also
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.840]   does with the enterprise version is you can have it so
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.640]   that when you log into the enterprise version, it also
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.040]   logs into your personal version.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.680]   So one log in and all my passwords are there.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.920]   And when I save a password, it saves it to the personal,
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.960]   but it's available no matter where I am.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:47.920]   So that's right.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.320]   And still keeps them separate.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.920]   Yeah, no, yeah, it's completely separate.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:51.760]   Nobody else--
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.640]   But it's simple because I only have one password to remember.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:00.400]   All right, so I think I'm out of whiskey, so no--
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.280]   the wake is over.
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.240]   It's time to live again.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.520]   Time to live again.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.920]   And Google Fi continues.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.760]   Thank goodness that's Google's MVNO, which I really like.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.880]   I use it on a Pixel 3.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.120]   Can't use it on really sensibly.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.840]   Can't use it on anything else.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.760]   You wrote an article, which I haven't read yet.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.520]   I'm very interested to hear you say--
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.080]   Yes.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:25.200]   Why you should use Google Fi, but not, mobile data?
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:25.760]   Yes.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.640]   So this is actually--
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.080]   began with a conversation I had with Jason.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:33.760]   I think he was hosting something you were out of the country,
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.720]   and Jason was hosting.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.120]   It might have been the show, actually.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.280]   Probably was, yeah.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.240]   And I think it was before the show where I mentioned to him
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.720]   that when I'm in the US, I just turn off data.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.360]   And I end up having phone calls and texts
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:49.120]   plus the ability to use Wi-Fi when I'm on Wi-Fi now.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.000]   And nowadays, you're always near Wi-Fi, right?
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.480]   But what about when you're out in the car?
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.000]   What do you do?
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.720]   Well, so this is the thing.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.280]   So we have multiple problems.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.920]   One is we all are cheap skates and we want to hang on to as much
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.880]   of our money as possible.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.120]   That's an essential thing.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:05.080]   So when I don't use data on Google Fi,
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.960]   it costs $20 a month for my phone bill.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.720]   Just phone-- because it's voice and text for 20 bucks.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.280]   10 bucks a gigabyte for data.
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:12.760]   Exactly.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.720]   But if I don't use data, you don't get any of that.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.600]   And it's a very inexpensive way.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.560]   And in fact, if you never turn on--
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.160]   the point I make in this column is
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.640]   if you never turn on data on a Google Fi phone,
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.400]   you save about as much money as you
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.080]   need to buy a new Pixel phone every year.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.600]   So it's a free phone to use data.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.360]   The average smartphone user, you're right,
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:34.760]   touches her phone 2,617 times a day.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.040]   So this is the other problem it solves.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.160]   We all have this problem of overuse and phone addiction,
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.520]   social media addiction.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.400]   And if you don't have a connection to social or to the internet
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.400]   when you're out and about socializing people's attention,
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.120]   you pay attention.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.640]   But you can still get calls and texts.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.200]   So if there's an emergency, you can still get it.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.200]   Yeah, you're not disconnected.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:52.700]   Right.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:53.400]   And just can't tweet.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:53.680]   Right.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.240]   So you can be an addicted--
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.040]   How am I supposed to play Pokemon Go?
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.280]   Exactly, Leo.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:02.640]   It's time to give up these addictive ways.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.240]   You're right.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.760]   And I think that all the time, especially when I catch myself
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.320]   driving and playing Pokemon Go.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:07.840]   Yes.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.840]   That's what I think.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.200]   This is going to kill me.
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.480]   This game is actually going to kill me.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.000]   Yes.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.640]   The Grim Reaper is going to catch you.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.360]   So you say, go into your settings on whatever phone you use
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.520]   and turn off mobile data.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.760]   Yes, turn off mobile data.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.560]   Wow.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:27.000]   If you really need mobile data for some reason,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.800]   you really want to play Pokemon Go.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.400]   Turn it on.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:34.120]   But the point is that make it more difficult to be constantly
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.320]   glued to your screen.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:38.160]   I mean, I've been observing this phenomenon for years
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.280]   and also looking at the numbers about how much--
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.080]   OK, see that button?
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.200]   I'm going to press it.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:42.600]   That's it?
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.920]   Mobile data is gone.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.760]   I just turn it off.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.360]   Well, you're still on Wi-Fi here in the Twitch.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.760]   Yeah, so I have data now.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.480]   You have data now.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.960]   But as soon as I get in the car,
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.240]   when you're in a restaurant or when you're in the car,
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.520]   whatever, you won't be connected to the internet.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.480]   Like, what can I think that's actually really smart?
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:00.280]   I think this is a sane, simple, trivially simple way
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:04.080]   for us to hold the line against smartphone addiction.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.880]   And again, the problem is over here.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.560]   You're in the mirror.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.880]   I looked at myself in the mirror probably about two years
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.840]   ago and noticed that I was just totally addicted.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:17.760]   Because I love technology, so I was always reading my phone,
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.480]   reading articles about technology and this and that,
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.200]   and answering notifications and just totally stressing myself
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.640]   out for no reason at all.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.520]   And now it is--
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.240]   You do this too?
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.360]   Oh, I was bad about it.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.000]   But now I just-- I still have all of my data and stuff
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:35.920]   connected.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.640]   But there are a lot of times where my phone is
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.320]   in another room somewhere, and I have no idea.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.120]   And I get a lot of angry voice smells and text and stuff
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:43.760]   from the missus.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.000]   Why aren't you answering all of that?
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.080]   People expect you to be always available, don't they?
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:47.920]   Isn't that funny?
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.080]   But this is the thing.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.760]   You can always be available by phone or text,
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:55.320]   which are non-addictive communications media.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.000]   I'm doing it on my other phone.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.640]   I'm so bad I have multiple phones.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.880]   I have to turn them on.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.320]   Yeah, cellular data.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:01.800]   It's OK.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.880]   You don't have a problem, Leo.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.400]   You're a professional.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.880]   I'm a trained professional.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.960]   Do not try this at home.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:09.880]   Wow.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.880]   I also have to find my Pokemon Go-Ball and turn that off.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:13.720]   Yeah, turn that off.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.160]   Oh, man.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.800]   I'm going to be shaking.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.720]   No, this is really interesting.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.600]   What a simple thing.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.520]   It's so simple.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.880]   And again, if you have a Google iPhone, $20 a month
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.680]   is a pretty small mobile bill.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.880]   The price is giving it away.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.440]   And it's like-- it's a free phone every year.
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:33.520]   So I'm going to be paying $90 a month for T-Mobile, no matter
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.880]   what, for Verizon, $90 a month, no matter what.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.440]   I'm on my Google 5 phone.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.200]   20 bucks.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.800]   So something to be said about that.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.840]   And you could turn it on for Maps.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.640]   Well, this is the other part of it
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.000]   that I wanted to highlight in this article.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.840]   We're having something that nobody has really mentioned
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:55.760]   or commented upon, which is an offline revolution.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.440]   So Google just recently announced
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.280]   offline voice dictation, which is--
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:57:59.600]   That's right.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:00.080]   Gboard.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:00.560]   Brilliant.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.600]   Gboard will dictate.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.120]   Right.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.120]   Even if you don't online.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:03.520]   Exactly.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:07.040]   Offline Maps for Google works exactly as good as online Maps.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.600]   And in fact, if you haven't looked lately,
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.440]   Google Maps will automatically download your neighborhood.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:11.840]   That's right.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.280]   It probably already has it.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.080]   I use offline Maps all over the world.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.360]   It's fantastic.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.520]   And the only downside is that Google offline does not
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:20.840]   support walking directions.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.560]   So I recommend an app called Maps.me.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.560]   Maps.me.
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.840]   Which has way better walking directions than Google.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:30.560]   And it's totally offline.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.920]   There are all kinds of things that are offline.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:34.840]   So you can take pictures.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:39.080]   You can make and receive phone calls and texts.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:39.680]   You can just map--
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.200]   You just can't post pictures to Instagram
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.120]   until you get home.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:42.640]   Exactly.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:43.680]   But you can do it when you get home.
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.480]   This is a healthier thing to wait for that process.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.200]   Oh, I'm going to do it.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.400]   I'm going to Hawaii.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:54.600]   I'm going to do it on vacation just to see if I could survive.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.280]   When you're in Hawaii, you're in paradise.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.360]   I should enjoy Hawaii.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.160]   You'll be able to survive in paradise.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.880]   Pokemon GO looks the same in Hawaii as it does here.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:06.320]   There's just not a little shirt, like a Hawaiian shirt.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.040]   All the characters.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.760]   Wow.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.080]   I like this.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.680]   And it's basically a free phone every year.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.120]   I like that.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.240]   Make Google buy your phone.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:19.160]   I'd have to get a new plan on T-Mobile and Verizon.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.160]   Yes.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:20.480]   Unfortunately.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.120]   I know someone that's on Google Fi,
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.640]   and they seem to complain about their monthly bill
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:27.920]   as far as it being fluctuating all the time.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.200]   And they couldn't quite figure out the math on it.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:33.480]   Well, when I was just leaving data on,
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.360]   I would blow past the six gigabyte--
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.960]   after six gigabytes, they pay for it.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.040]   And at 15 gigs, they throttle it.
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:44.240]   And I was at 15 gigs five days in to the month.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:48.120]   And so nowadays, I really slow it down.
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.440]   There's some cases when I do turn on data.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:54.920]   But I try to keep my bill under $40 a month if I can.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.880]   And this is actually brilliant.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.240]   And it's not-- I mean, saving money is one thing,
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.720]   but really saving your life is the real reason.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:01.880]   Right.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.520]   Pay attention to the world when you're out and about.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.040]   You know?
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.320]   OK, I'm going to try it.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.480]   You can do this later.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.080]   I have a strong hunch that you'll be just fine in Hawaii
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.080]   without your phones there.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.680]   Is he right?
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.040]   As Jerome Lanier likes to say, reality is so high definition.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.200]   It is-- it's almost perfect.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:23.800]   It's yeah.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.800]   It's amazing.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.320]   Low latency.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.560]   You could actually see the rust.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.360]   It's incredible.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:38.040]   Oh, you are really challenging.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.920]   Meanwhile, if you're in China, you
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.200]   don't have to worry because Google's
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:47.640]   going to block any advertisements for sites that
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.680]   help bypass censorship.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.360]   This is the slippery slope that Apple's gone down
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.160]   and that Google's going down with authoritarian regimes.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.160]   If you want to do business in China as a big country,
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.480]   you're going to end up--
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.320]   I didn't realize Google did any business in China,
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.640]   but I guess the advertisements that it's money on, right?
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.200]   So one way that I look at this story
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.280]   is it's part of the things that people complain about,
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.760]   but don't do anything about it.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:21.080]   So nobody-- the reason Google can help authoritarian regimes
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:24.920]   crack down and essentially violate their human right
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:30.280]   to access to information, which is Article 19,
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.480]   I believe, of the Human Rights Convention,
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.040]   is because nobody cares.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.320]   People in the US and Europe and elsewhere,
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.840]   they're helping China become this Orwellian high tech
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.920]   dictatorship.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.000]   People are like, yeah, whatever.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.560]   At least I get good search.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.520]   And so I think that's one perspective on this.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.000]   The other one is wrapped up in their project,
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.240]   their controversial project.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.760]   What is it called, Leo, that we're
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.640]   going to do a search engine?
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.640]   Right.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.280]   I mean, when Google was in China, they did censor search.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.640]   You remember you do a search for Tiananmen Square in China
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.040]   and show all these tourist photos of people taking snapshots.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.840]   And then in the West, Tiananmen Square
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.440]   was like people staying for a tank.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.040]   And so--
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.360]   But they were very principled.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.200]   And when China went one step too far, they said, all right,
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:17.920]   that's it, we're out.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.520]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.640]   Now they want to go back with this dragonfly, which
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.440]   is a search engine for China.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.600]   Now Google has said again and again, that's dead.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.760]   We're not doing it.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.880]   The intercept keeps saying no.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.440]   They're still working on it.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.720]   In fact, the latest from the intercept,
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.680]   Google's conducting a secret performance review
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.640]   of its censored China project.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.160]   So there's a small group of top managers at Google
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.960]   are still working on project dragonfly.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.240]   And it's hard to gauge how seriously to detect--
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.960]   Yeah, I don't know if I trust the intercept in this.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.360]   My guess is that giant companies that
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.280]   are multi-billion dollar companies,
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.720]   hundred billion dollar companies above,
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.880]   who have their fingers in a lot of honeypots, so to speak,
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.840]   have to have lots of stuff in the wings ready to go.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.400]   They're always working on stuff.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.480]   That's right.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.000]   We know that.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.360]   We just talked about it for an hour.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.800]   Right, exactly.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.760]   Google says, OK, we have no plans to do this.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.640]   But that doesn't mean they don't have a--
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.320]   We might have even working at it.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.040]   Probably looking at all kinds of things.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:24.800]   Right.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.280]   It's hard to say how much to invest in these intercept
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:29.800]   reports.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.960]   It's still good to know that this stuff is going on.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.360]   You've been to Cuba.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:33.560]   Yes.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.840]   And I remember you telling me when you were in Cuba
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:40.040]   that there is this kind of sneaker net internet,
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:44.760]   a underground of USB keys with internet content on it.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.120]   That's right.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.400]   And they spread like wildfire and you subscribe to these.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.400]   And--
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.600]   So it's actually a business.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.280]   You subscribe?
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:51.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.840]   You'll get every week.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.360]   You'll get a new USB key.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.240]   I don't remember the frequency, but it's every week,
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.120]   every couple of weeks, every month, something like that.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:58.640]   What's on there?
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.320]   Like Facebook?
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.480]   It's a bunch of Netflix movies.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.400]   It's content from all the social networks.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.160]   It's a mishmash of popular things that
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.000]   are happening on the public internet.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   Because when I was there a year and a half ago or whenever
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.240]   it was, you could only access the internet from a sidewalk.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:16.960]   You'd have to go up to this.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.320]   Nobody had it in their house.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.760]   No, nobody had it in their house.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:20.600]   Then they rolled it out.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.400]   If you were a communist party person in good standing,
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.240]   then you could get it in your house.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.520]   And they're slowly expanding it.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.720]   Is that an infrastructure issue they just don't have?
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:30.720]   No, it's a government.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.320]   No, it's a government.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.320]   Yeah, they don't--
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.920]   Because they were just locked down.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.320]   Yeah, when you would go to one of these sidewalk locations,
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.280]   of which they had, I don't know, 50 in the whole country,
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.440]   you'd have to get in line.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.800]   And there'd be a little trailer.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.520]   And you pay.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.560]   And they take your passport, copy it.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:52.720]   They know exactly who exactly is looking at exactly what.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.920]   And I remember when I went in 2008 into Cuba,
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.120]   and they had these cyber cafes that were really expensive.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.800]   And they literally had a uniform police officer
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:07.080]   looking at your screen while you're using the internet in 2008.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.560]   So what's interesting about them, the most interesting--
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:12.040]   and I think that's why it's relevant to the show--
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.720]   is that Google is the company of investing
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.560]   with the Cuban government.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.920]   And I've been to the-- so Google has this showcase room
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:23.960]   in an art gallery just in Havana, outside of Havana.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.200]   It's near Havana.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.920]   And you go there, and they have Google Cardboard,
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.440]   and they have Chromebooks.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.560]   And they have all this stuff.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:30.920]   And it's--
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.560]   In a country with no internet, Google literally--
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.440]   They have much of a future.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:36.520]   They have one cable that goes to Venezuela of all places.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:40.600]   So that's not a good place to connect your country.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:44.120]   But this was the fastest internet in the country, easily.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.920]   And there was a long line of people who just wanted to sit down
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.600]   and use a Chromebook at high speed.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.360]   Can you imagine?
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.080]   And so what's happening now is--
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.680]   so a couple of things with these stories
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.480]   that we're talking about here is Google
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.040]   is in such good standing with the Cuban government
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.880]   and the Trump administration is not.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.840]   Google has become kind of a--
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.720]   A competitor.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.360]   --to the Cuban government and go between the government
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.840]   of the US and Cuba.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.680]   And also, they're trying to work with Cuba
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.720]   to do another undersea cable.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.280]   Because there's probably 20 cable--
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280]   I'm making this number up.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.240]   But there's a bunch of cables that just go around Cuba.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:21.760]   Right.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.520]   Because they're crisscrossing the oceans in every direction.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.680]   And Cuba's not getting any.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.200]   And Google would like to connect them
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.600]   with a really fat pipe from Miami or something.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.920]   And so that Cubans have, if they want, fastest internet
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.160]   as they want to.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.600]   And so this is something that is a possibility.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.560]   It's in the works.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.760]   But again, as we mentioned before,
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.760]   it's kind of a political threat for the Cuban people
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.560]   to have free access and fast access and low-cost access
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.560]   to information.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.880]   So there you go.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.960]   This is the submarine cable map from Telah geography.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.840]   And if I zoom in on the Caribbean, you see Cuba.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.360]   And you see all the cables going--
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.560]   this is Cuba right here.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.560]   You see all the cables going around.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.120]   It looks like a wind tunnel where the air goes around.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:11.080]   And they've got one little janky line to Jamaica.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.400]   And then as you said, another one to Venezuela.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:17.600]   And I don't know where this green one goes.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.760]   But even the Dominican Republic and Haiti
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.760]   are better connected.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.080]   Puerto Rico, of course.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.200]   In fact, the Bahamas are trying really hard
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.960]   to become a data haven.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.200]   They want a high-speed internet to the Bahamas
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.880]   because they'd like NASA.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:37.240]   In the early days, the Bahamas were a pirate haven.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:37.720]   Yes.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.240]   Now they want to be a data haven.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.680]   Remember when we were in the Bahamas?
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.280]   Use a pirate haven.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:45.200]   Talking to their minister of information and said, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.280]   We want to make NASA be the place you go for things
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.760]   like a bit torrent.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:57.360]   And they-- so Cuba, big island, not a lot of connection.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:57.880]   Yep.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:02.200]   And so it's a real source object because, of course,
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.400]   the Cuban people know what's happening in the world.
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.400]   It's interesting.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.880]   They're not ignorant of this.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.400]   They want this.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.240]   We were having dinner with some friends in Cuba
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.280]   that we had just met.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.160]   And they said, oh, how are those fires in Santa Barbara?
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.520]   So I was from Santa Barbara.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.360]   They knew about it.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.080]   They knew about it because there's
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.600]   another business where somebody will come into a apartment
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.280]   building, illegally set up satellite dishes.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.560]   And they literally run wires down the halls
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.760]   and into the front doors of people to get satellite TV.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.320]   And it's a cat and mouse game.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:39.920]   So what I was told was it cost them about $900
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.080]   to install the satellite dish.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.080]   And if they can keep it running for three months,
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.480]   they recoup the $900.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.840]   And then it's profit after that.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:50.640]   But they sometimes shut down sooner than three months.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.240]   Sometimes it takes them four months or five months.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.040]   But they always get shut down at some point.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.400]   And so I just thought that was fascinating.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.280]   And what they get is a Univision.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:04.920]   So they get the Spanish language channel from the US.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.560]   And they can watch the news on you.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.440]   Saburo Gigantico.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.400]   Exactly.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.680]   Primo Impacto.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.920]   Oh, I used to watch that.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.920]   Did you speak Spanish?
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.200]   Heck no, but I used to like watching Jackie Gerrito.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:20.720]   Weather.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.120]   Weather girl.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.640]   Oh, you watched such a pig.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.840]   Wow.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.400]   That's pretty funny.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.360]   I think Saburo Gigantico is over, right?
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.200]   He retired.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.000]   No idea.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.320]   Anyway, it was fun.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.320]   Yep.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.280]   While it lasted.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.080]   While it lasted.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.760]   NASA and Google are also partnering,
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:48.360]   but not for Cuban undersea cables, but for Mars exploration.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:51.880]   There's a part of the Antarctica that is very Mars-like.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.520]   And so Google's doing a big mapping project with NASA.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.080]   Great.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.120]   And so now you have Street View for what they call the, I think,
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.000]   Earth's Mars or something like that.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:01.760]   It's basically--
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.880]   It's Devon Island.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.280]   You need to do this on Chrome in Google Earth.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.840]   But you can do this travel through the--
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.680]   I guess it's not happening here.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.600]   Google Earth is so amazing.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.280]   Probably because I'm running something that's blocking it.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:17.720]   Let's see.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.200]   How about they fix it to where I don't almost
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:25.400]   miss my appointment today because it took me to a back street?
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.600]   Is that why you were late?
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.640]   Is that what happened?
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.960]   Play the drums.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.800]   Do you know where that is?
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.480]   Carsten, leave you the keys.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.240]   The Google change log.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.560]   Our student is on vacation.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.360]   He's in Montana.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.360]   But I think he left Kevin the keys to the change log.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.160]   It's like a change log lever.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.520]   He has to throw.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.480]   There's a red cover over it.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.560]   He has to throw the cover open and then flip to switch.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.520]   Two guys have to turn keys.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.240]   Yeah, two guys have to turn keys at opposite ends of the console.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:59.080]   Google Podcasts in episode search is coming for podcasters like us.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.400]   This is fantastic.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.920]   Shows are being fully transcribed.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.320]   That means you'll be able to search for stuff
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:12.640]   like you could say, what was that whiskey that Aunt Prue was
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.400]   drinking?
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.080]   And you can search for it, Prue it in whiskey,
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.640]   and go right to that part of the episode.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.600]   There might be a lot of content on that.
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.120]   You might find many results.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.320]   Yes.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.240]   It's awesome.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.280]   I really love the future of podcasting in this regard.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:32.080]   I don't like the invasion by all the public radio people
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.000]   who don't get podcasting.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:34.760]   But I love the--
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.760]   They're killing projects.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.960]   --I do have really good--
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.840]   But I love the metrics.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:45.600]   Because I listen to so many podcasts, Leo, that are just--
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.120]   There's great stuff.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:47.960]   Weather's great stuff.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.880]   But I also get so mad that I just three minutes in,
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.360]   and I'm done.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.360]   I'll go to the next one.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.160]   No, I do that all the time.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:53.880]   And I want them to know it.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.400]   Because it's like they don't understand--
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.800]   They do things that really bug me.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.840]   And I want to protest by stopping listening.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.520]   And I want them to know that I stopped listening at that point.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.520]   So they know what's bothering people.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.320]   People stop listening to my shows invariably send me
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.200]   a big email saying, why I'm not listening to this week
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.080]   at Google anymore?
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.480]   Or you're on a different level.
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.840]   You want to be in the middle.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:19.960]   I get those every day.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.560]   But it's like, can I mention other podcast networks?
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.080]   Is that OK?
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:27.320]   OK, so Slate is-- they have some good podcasts.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.800]   But they do stuff like they do this bait and switch,
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:35.160]   where you subscribe to the Culture Gantt Fest.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.560]   And they'll just play the spoiler special.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.160]   It should be there.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.200]   I didn't sign up for that.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.720]   And then now every fourth Trump cast
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.320]   is you have to pay for it.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.520]   So it's like they tease it.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.160]   And they're like, well, if you sign up for site plus,
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.000]   then blah, blah, blah.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.440]   I'm like, you guys don't get podcasting.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.600]   That's not what it's all about.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.640]   If you can't make it on advertising, go back to radio.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.680]   But isn't that how radio survives advertising?
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:12:59.680]   Yes.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.120]   But we survive on advertising.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.200]   People translate it over to the podcast.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.000]   But on radio, they don't say, well,
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.320]   you can't listen to this radio program.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.760]   It's in every fourth program.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.280]   They just do the ad.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.640]   And then everybody gets it for free.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.240]   So--
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.720]   Well, you know, what else is peeved?
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:16.800]   You're not going to be able to hear transcripts of BBC
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.400]   podcasts on your Google podcast, because they're pulling out.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.840]   Is there a trend toward everything going out?
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:22.360]   Yes.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.720]   Because that's terrible.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.480]   I agree.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.560]   It's not what podcasting--
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.480]   I'm not going to listen to the BBC app.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.320]   BBC wants you to use the BBC Sounds app.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.400]   Not going to happen.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:37.240]   And frankly, Spotify, with Spotify buying Gimlet and Anker,
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.160]   I have a feeling that Spotify's plan
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.320]   is to do something similar.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:40.840]   Yep.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.840]   They have a free tier.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.880]   And it's on its own sense.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.680]   But you'd still have to use the Spotify app.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.280]   And I'll tell you what's driving a lot of that
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.680]   is advertisers who say we need metrics.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.760]   When we buy a banner ad, we know who sees it and who clicks on it.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.480]   Why don't we know that with a podcast?
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.040]   It's digital, isn't it?
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.560]   All right.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.800]   Of course, with a-- you buy a Super Bowl ad,
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.680]   you don't know if anybody saw it.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.840]   They could all have been going to the bathroom during your ad.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.560]   But you don't complain about that.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:10.360]   To me, the whole point of podcasting
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.360]   is that I can go on a long hike and I can just say go.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.440]   And it just plays one after the other.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.640]   And if-- I'm not going to be like, I'm
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.960]   going to be a BBC podcast consumer now.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.440]   I'm going to switch over to this other app.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.360]   It's never going to happen.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.440]   I'm never even going to download that app.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.240]   I just hate this trend.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:37.080]   Well, how about buying stuff from Walmart on your Google Assistant?
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.800]   So this is something I do all the time on Amazon's Echo
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.600]   with Amazon.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.360]   And it says, when I run out of batteries,
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.240]   I say, echo, buy some type C batteries.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.600]   And she'll say, well, the last time you bought batteries,
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.040]   you bought these, you want to order these again?
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.200]   And I say, yes.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:53.160]   What's your special code?
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:53.680]   I enter the--
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:54.180]   I say--
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:55.560]   Make it sound dirty.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.680]   Hi.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.040]   What's your four digit code?
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.840]   One, two, three, four.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.000]   Oh, I love it when you say that.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.160]   You've just bought batteries.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.400]   Talk nerdy to me.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.560]   Talk nerdy to me, Leo.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.880]   So I actually love that feature.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.120]   I've considered Google Home then.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.440]   But this is where Google was a little bit behind Amazon.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.360]   So doing a deal with Walmart, this is--
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.920]   Walmart kind of is afraid of Amazon.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.200]   So naturally, they're going to do a deal.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.000]   You could say, Google, talk to Walmart.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.960]   I don't like it that I have to say that first.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.080]   They are going to use prior purchases.
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:38.320]   Same way that Amazon does.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.520]   So they've been in partnership for a couple of years,
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:46.800]   but this is now going to be active on your Google Assistant.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.480]   And I really support this, Leo, because my book is also
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.360]   available on Walmart.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:58.080]   But seriously, this is kind of a week, half-assed,
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:02.720]   and there's no other response to Amazon's just total dominance
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.120]   of online commerce.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.840]   Well, even Amazon says, not that many people
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:08.440]   use voice to buy stuff.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.200]   It's not a huge market.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.360]   I guess it's a coming market.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.200]   The big picture with Amazon is just
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.280]   that they're a much more massive company that's
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.920]   much more involved in people's lives
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.600]   than the public even realizes.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:29.080]   And so the Amazon Echo really made the smart speaker
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.040]   market what it is today.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.920]   And Google Home is like catching up fast.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.440]   It's growing faster than Amazon Echo, I believe,
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.320]   still.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.680]   But the idea that, OK, I'm a prime member, once you're a prime
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.560]   member, you're like, OK, well, I should also
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.760]   shop at Whole Foods then.
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.720]   And I should get an Amazon Echo instead of a Google Home.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.120]   And I should do this, that, and the other thing.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:53.640]   And so there's this kind of sense of, like, Amazon doesn't
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.800]   feel like an all-encompassing platform, but it kind of is.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.880]   And it's problematic, regardless of whether to be
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:00.560]   pictures or make--
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.280]   I think in the future, there's going
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.240]   to be a lot more purchasing.
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.280]   Because we're just going to be chit-chatting with our agents,
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.880]   whatever they are, all day, all the time.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:11.440]   And buying stuff is just going to be another use case
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:12.520]   for that technology.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.440]   Two things.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.440]   I disagree.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.120]   I'm an Amazon prime person, but I don't see myself
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.880]   falling into the Amazon ecosystem and just wanting to get
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.680]   whatever the little device is called,
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.880]   or whatever their smart devices are.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.080]   I don't care anything about it.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:32.720]   All I care about is how much is my prime subscription each year,
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.600]   and how soon are my packages going to get here,
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.280]   because I order stuff so frequently.
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.240]   And it's not necessarily ordering Amazon branded stuff,
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.080]   either.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.960]   No, in fact, half your purchases are not from Amazon,
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.880]   even on Amazon.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.880]   Right.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.440]   So I can care less about the brand of Amazon
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.040]   or the ecosystem of them.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.160]   And number two, I give Walmart credit for saying,
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:55.840]   you know what?
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.600]   We got to at least make an effort at it.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:02.080]   Because at one time, Walmart was like Amazon,
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.160]   as far as just being where everybody went.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.080]   How much money you made.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.480]   Or how much people hated Walmart and all the talk about Walmart,
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.000]   not paying its employees well enough.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.400]   Nobody worries about that anymore.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.200]   We're rooting for them to be to Amazon.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.360]   Right.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.880]   Finally, a good old-fashioned brick and mortar store.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.600]   Mom and Poppin'.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.280]   Wouldn't it be nice to have John Legend respond when you try
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.360]   to buy stuff from Walmart?
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.120]   Now you can.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.040]   All you have to do is tell your Google Assistant,
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.320]   talk like a legend.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.720]   Here, let's-
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:34.560]   Oh my gosh.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:35.400]   - I love it so much. - Let's watch.
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.280]   You read it rock and roll?
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.040]   I'm your Google Assistant.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.760]   I can help you find answers and have fun.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.520]   The forecast is 72 and sunny.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.240]   Can I just say something?
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.160]   Why John Legend?
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.160]   He doesn't have that distinctive a voice.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:52.360]   If he had Gilbert Godfrey, then you'd know that it was-
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.200]   Do you need Gilbert?
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:54.040]   - Shouting at you.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.120]   But honestly, I mean, I like John Legend.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.280]   He's a great singer, but is his voice that distinctive?
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.880]   That you'd go, "Oh, John Legend."
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880]   I don't think I'd know.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:05.080]   No, no, it sounds like a voice that's coming
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.560]   through some tainty speakers.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.280]   I want Anne Pruitt on my Google home.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.120]   Hey.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:11.960]   Something.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.160]   Talk like an aunt.
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:17.720]   Okay, here's one of my favorite songs.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.800]   Happy birthday.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.800]   Now that's cool.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.320]   ♪ Whose birthday it is ♪
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.320]   That's cool.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:24.240]   Whoa.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.240]   Yeah, I'm feeling this new voice.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.840]   You can find me on all kinds of devices.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:33.840]   Phones, Google homes, and if I'm lucky, in your heart.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.080]   Google Assistant now featuring the voice.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:37.920]   It's so cute.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.320]   To say, "Hey, Google, talk like a legend."
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:45.880]   They talked about that at Google I/O almost a year ago.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.320]   Yeah, last year, I thought.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.320]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.360]   One of your devices is responding.
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.680]   That's the rest.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:53.520]   Okay.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.360]   Let's have some fun.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.520]   That's John Legend.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.760]   It says, "Hi, John Legend."
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.760]   Let me, what?
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.200]   I just, it worked.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.040]   Yep.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.240]   Or good.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.120]   Talk like a legend.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:12.840]   He's sleeping right now.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.680]   He's taking time.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.520]   He said, "Hi, John Legend.
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.980]   "Here, I'll let my voice to your Google Assistant
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:20.560]   "because you're, hey, Google, tell me a joke."
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.240]   John Legend is apparently very quiet.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.600]   He doesn't know any jokes.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.880]   He's a singer.
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:32.760]   Oh, you know what happened?
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.160]   I turned data off.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:35.440]   (laughs)
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.440]   Sorry, Leo.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.400]   That didn't last long.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.600]   I want my data back.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.080]   You know, why if I had to studio?
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:42.920]   Come on.
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.480]   Well, it's, it's bound, the little balls are bouncing.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.840]   I don't know.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.280]   Give me Gilbert Guy for you.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.640]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.480]   So then,
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:55.480]   you want to buy those batteries?
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.560]   (laughs)
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.400]   That would be--
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.240]   I would pay for that.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.080]   Let me tell you about batteries and a cat.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.160]   (laughs)
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.840]   (laughs)
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:11.560]   I did have Tom, Tom used to do celebrity voices
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.920]   in their GPS, remember that?
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:13.760]   Elvis.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:15.960]   Oh, you don't want to go there.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.920]   Turn left, buddy.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.040]   I had, I had, oh, who was it?
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.240]   It was, oh, it was so funny.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.280]   Well, first of all, Glados from Portal.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.120]   Right.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.520]   But she would lie to you.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.360]   Oh, really?
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.880]   Yeah, she would say turn left when she was supposed to turn
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.200]   right, which sounded very dangerous to the GPS,
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:36.040]   saying turn left, but there's no, so that was a bad one.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:36.880]   Right.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.200]   And then I had,
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.640]   who was the guy in Easy Rider?
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.920]   Not Sadie Sam?
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:42.920]   No, that would be funny.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.360]   No, the guy in Easy Rider,
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.640]   not Jack Nicholson, the other guy.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:47.640]   Not Peter Fonda.
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.920]   Not Peter Fonda, the other guy.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.880]   Oh, I can't remember his name.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.720]   Isn't that funny?
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:56.880]   He had this stoner voice, Dennis Hopper.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:57.800]   He's a good one.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.240]   Why would anybody ever want to go here?
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:03.800]   He went, yeah, him, him, that guy.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.000]   Oh, man.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.480]   That's a long way to go.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.320]   Okay.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:13.240]   It gets bad after a while.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.320]   You change it right back.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:18.800]   I'm totally fine with the default voice on D's assistance.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.360]   Yeah, it seems like a good idea.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.960]   You can get Bert Reynolds for $12.95.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:26.160]   For Mr. T.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.240]   Is he still can?
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.360]   On a Tom Tom?
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:28.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:29.480]   But who has a Tom Tom?
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.080]   Nobody.
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.200]   Ways and ways you can get celebrity voices.
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.400]   In fact, I recorded my voice,
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.160]   because you can, anybody can do it.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.000]   And then I recorded, you know, you sit down and says,
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.360]   okay, say turn left, turn right, say all the things.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:42.720]   Right.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:43.720]   And then you can bundle it up.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.320]   And I put it somewhere, I forgot where I put it,
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.720]   somewhere if you search around for it,
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.560]   you're gonna have me.
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:48.120]   Sell that.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.320]   On your ways, I should sell that.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.320]   Google I/O dates have been announced
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:56.120]   and there will be sessions on Stadia.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.120]   If they don't cancel it before then.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:01.720]   Dark mode, Linux on Chrome OS and more.
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:02.800]   Dark mode.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.160]   What is it with dark mode?
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:05.040]   I don't get it.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.120]   It's a color scheme.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.360]   It's a color scheme.
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.680]   Why is that a feature of any OS?
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:10.960]   It's like dark mode.
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.840]   It's a bit on us.
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:12.840]   Yeah, I guess so.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.400]   I don't mind the feature.
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.040]   I just don't get the enthusiasm.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.200]   Google has posted the initial schedule,
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.120]   so if you'd like to start planning your I/O,
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:25.120]   we are gonna send Jason Howell, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.680]   We will be covering the Google I/O keynotes.
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:33.680]   Google I/O is coming to town May 7th.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.600]   And so actually it's gonna be a busy week
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.800]   'cause the day before Microsoft's Build
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:41.880]   Developers Conference, they've overlapped once again.
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:44.520]   So Paul and Mary Jo will be a build on Monday.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.360]   We'll do the keynote on Monday, then Tuesday.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.160]   It'll be Google I/O.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.800]   It's gonna be crazy.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.560]   I stopped going to Google I/O
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.600]   when they stopped giving me free laptops.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:54.440]   Just kidding.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:55.280]   I never did that.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.440]   That wasn't a nice feature.
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.920]   Yeah, I remember the one, there was one Google I/O
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.520]   where they gave you a ton of stuff.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.040]   It wasn't a Pixelbook, whatever they called it before that.
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.000]   So they gave you a laptop.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.600]   They gave you a phone, an Android phone.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.440]   And the next two watches.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.280]   Remember that?
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.520]   They gave you one of the Android--
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.240]   But you're good.
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.400]   You turned it down.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.240]   I turned them all down.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.080]   I really admire them.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:19.160]   Well, I actually gave it back and then bought one.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:19.960]   That's how it should be.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.600]   That's how journalists should work.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.040]   Developers is fine.
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.840]   But journalists should not accept this stuff.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.360]   Right.
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.200]   What they won't give you, or maybe they will,
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:33.000]   the new Nest Hub Max, a 10-inch smart display with a camera.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.520]   Kind of like the Google Home Hub.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.400]   But this isn't officially announced.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.600]   It's just the Google Store accidentally posted it.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.400]   Right.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.760]   And of course, everybody jumped on it.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.800]   I think the 10-inch will be a much better option
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:44.840]   than the current option.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.000]   I like the Home Hub.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:46.600]   I am a fan.
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.000]   First of all, it doesn't have a camera in it.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.440]   So Lisa doesn't mind that it's sitting next to our bed.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.680]   It's a great digital frame.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.480]   So I just said it to family and friends.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.960]   It's tiny, but it's right there next to the bed.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.120]   And every once in a while, Lisa say, oh, I remember that.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.320]   Or where was that?
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.200]   And that's really fun.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.080]   I like that.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.080]   But I thought it was supposed to be like a kitchen device,
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:06.560]   though.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.560]   Or you could put it in the kitchen.
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.640]   It's just a slideshow.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.120]   And you could talk to it.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:10.640]   Bathroom.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.840]   But it's a very good kind of clock--
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.400]   Yes.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.240]   Bedside clock.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:18.120]   Because when the lights go out, it dims very dark.
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.080]   Because I don't like any lights.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.640]   And it makes it very dim.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.800]   When lights come on, you can ask you
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:23.320]   what's the weather.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.200]   You could say, good morning.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.200]   It'll give you a whole morning rundown.
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.760]   You could sit in a-- often will roll over, say, wake me up.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.520]   And I say, hey, you know who wake me up when it's 8.30.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.440]   And it'll wake me up.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.440]   Right.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:35.440]   It nudges me gently.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:37.360]   And I just remember seeing it in person and thinking,
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.560]   my pixel XL is bigger than you.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.760]   Oh, yes, really small.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:41.800]   But it's cheap.
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:44.520]   It's not expensive.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.680]   So remember the stadium announcement.
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.880]   Sundar Pichai, first of all said, I don't play games.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.280]   Good way to start a game announcement.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.160]   Then he said--
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.000]   Why are we here?
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   Sundar.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.200]   Then he did say, we have the most played game of all time,
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.360]   which is the dinosaur game.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:02.240]   Google has a new one.
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:06.640]   It's got an offline Easter egg game that's like Flappy Bird.
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:08.920]   But instead of a bird, it's a cloud
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.800]   that you're trying to avoid getting punctured by sharp build
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.920]   birds.
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.080]   It's like the Dino game.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.120]   But it's only on mobile.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.400]   Don't go open up Chrome in your desktop browser.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.200]   You've got to search for something that doesn't exist.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.440]   Actually, I can do it.
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:29.840]   I turned off data.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.240]   So I have to--
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.240]   All I have to--
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.800]   I now have a game I can play.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.600]   Yay!
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.840]   So turn off data on your phone, do a search.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.560]   And you'll get this new little floating cloudy games.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:47.040]   Go to a site that doesn't exist, like Google+.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:47.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.240]   No, it exists, unfortunately.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.160]   They have a page that says--
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.960]   Yes, it says it doesn't exist.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.320]   It has to be a site that doesn't even
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.640]   have a doesn't exist page.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.640]   404.
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.640]   It's a dangerous thing.
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.560]   It's a good name.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.200]   What else is going on?
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.760]   Android Q beta 2 came out today.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.200]   Yesterday, the March-- or is it the April?
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:14.560]   I guess the April update for Android.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:18.200]   You probably won't get it until later, unless you're
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:18.880]   on a Pixel.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:25.840]   Anything else for a change log?
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.840]   You can now-- for a long time, I've
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:33.120]   used a UBI key to log into my Google stuff.
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:33.560]   But--
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:34.040]   Have it--
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:34.040]   Have it--
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:35.040]   Have it--
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.040]   Oh, shut up, see that.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:36.720]   I hate--
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:41.080]   I have auto place stopped on this, and it's still place.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:41.520]   I don't know.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.400]   They figure it out a way around it.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.920]   So this is a UBI key.
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.720]   So when I log into my Google account,
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.680]   I can put in the UBI key, and it will give me the second factor
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.880]   after I give it the password.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.680]   But it only worked on Chrome for a long time, which is really
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.120]   annoying because I don't use Chrome.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.200]   And it would--
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.880]   Now you can use Firefox and Microsoft's Edge
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.320]   with your secure log in.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.440]   So that's good.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:05.280]   That's good news.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:11.720]   No, nothing more to say, but that's just good news.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.960]   I wish it would work at Safari because that's mostly
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:17.640]   the problem is that on Apple, I don't use Chrome.
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.560]   So one thing that I think is worth talking about
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:23.640]   is the--
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:26.920]   there's a consensus that YouTube radicalizes people.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.640]   So if you are interested in--
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:30.440]   Let's say--
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.120]   Save this for--
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.120]   When we end the change log.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.080]   We're still in the change log.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:34.580]   Gotcha.
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:36.520]   But save it because right after--
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.920]   there's only one more thing in the change log.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.720]   Google duplex, which is that weird voice that calls restaurants
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:45.880]   and makes reservations, is now available or going
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:49.680]   to be available on non-pixel phones and iOS devices.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.240]   They're slowly rolling out, so don't expect it right away.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:52.840]   But it will be.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.600]   And also, it only works in certain areas.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.800]   Although apparently now it's up to 43 states.
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:01.400]   Well, the same technology is used for the call screening
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.000]   in the Pixel 3.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000]   I love that feature.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.200]   The call screening is awesome.
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:09.760]   Yeah, so if you see a call coming in from a robo-caller,
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.680]   which is 90% of my calls--
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:11.880]   And you, too, are an introvert who
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.240]   doesn't like to talk to people.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.920]   You just press the button and it says, screen it.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:16.920]   And you don't have to answer it.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:19.240]   And then you can interact and say, well,
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.600]   you can tell the assistant to ask the person to tell me more.
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.080]   Oh, that's when the duplex comes in,
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.000]   because you're giving them additional stuff
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000]   that they don't already know.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.480]   You can kind of guide the conversation.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:29.440]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.080]   And listen to it.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.360]   There's another tip that if you hit the-- what is it?
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.240]   You hit the volume button.
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.400]   You can listen to the whole conversation,
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.040]   both sides of it, if you want to.
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:38.800]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.560]   Yeah, you can read it, but you can also listen.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.880]   Doesn't the person in the other hand
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:46.040]   know that you're feeding Google questions to ask?
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:51.440]   Say, OK, but who was my best friend in fourth grade?
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.400]   I've gotten calls from a lot of people who clearly never
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.720]   heard of Google duplex.
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.440]   And they just assume it's some kind of high-tech voicemail
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.040]   they never heard of.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:00.400]   Oh, you have a fancy assistant.
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.600]   Oh, and the other great thing about it is it sends you
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:03.160]   a transcript.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.000]   So somebody contacted me.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.120]   They had this whole conversation.
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:07.560]   They want to have a conversation.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.440]   They gave me the email.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:09.960]   And then I forgot it.
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:12.040]   And then I went into the app and retrieved the email
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:15.200]   from the transcript, which was really nice.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.560]   One thing it won't tell you, though, is this has been a sponsored
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.680]   ad.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.720]   This is trouble for Google.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.360]   It's an illegal thing.
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.240]   But apparently--
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.640]   and this is according to a story in Reuters--
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:32.360]   some of the search results you get from your Google Assistant
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:37.320]   are paid results, which Assistant does not tell you.
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:40.880]   The FTC requires either a disclaimer
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:44.440]   saying it's a sponsored announcement or an ad or something
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:44.960]   like that.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:49.160]   We're very careful, as you might know, to always--
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:53.160]   anytime something's sponsored to say, this is paid for.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:56.680]   But the Google Assistant will recommend home service
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:01.360]   providers without disclosing that the results come from a database,
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:04.040]   mainly composed of companies that joined a Google marketing
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:09.040]   program, maybe because it's not entirely from a paid program.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:12.880]   Reuters asked a number of attorneys.
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.800]   They all said, if there's a financial commitment,
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.000]   you must disclose it.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.480]   I guess Google's getting around it saying, well,
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.320]   it's not like there's a direct relationship.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.480]   These are people that join a marketing plan.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.480]   It just happens that they're getting recommended.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.520]   Mm.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:31.240]   FTC does say, when, for instance, if you-- and this, by the way,
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:32.360]   is widely flouted.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.480]   If you're on Instagram and you post a picture of you
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:38.040]   and your McCallons, the Cask strength whiskey--
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:41.360]   and McCallon gave you a bottle or gave you a buck to do that,
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:44.120]   you're supposed to say ad or sponsored.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:46.040]   So few people on Instagram do that now.
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:46.840]   Yep.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:47.720]   It's a real problem.
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.560]   But it raises the question--
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:53.000]   search is very lucrative because of ads.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.720]   And we're moving to a situation where
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.000]   we're going to be using assistance who just give us an answer.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:57.960]   It's a problem.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.520]   So where do you monetize?
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:31:59.960]   Like where's the--
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.120]   Right.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.960]   And that's not-- I mean, if it's going to say--
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:06.280]   I mean, there's ways to say-- and now, here's
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:07.440]   a sponsored result.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:07.880]   Yes.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.600]   There's ways to do it, but they're not doing it.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:12.600]   The FTC, apparently, according to Reuters,
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:15.360]   did a Freedom of Information request
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:18.240]   and got information that said the FCC has not received
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.000]   any complaints about this.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.040]   Because you would-- who's going to complain?
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:24.480]   You don't even know that that plumber was in this.
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:26.560]   You don't know.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.600]   Just put it in much smaller font size.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:29.560]   Sponsor.
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.040]   It's--
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.840]   You could put it on the screen if you had a screen,
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.560]   but a lot of assistance don't have a screen.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:35.000]   So you have to say it.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:37.160]   Right.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:42.480]   And that's the Google change log.
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:45.160]   And he gave you both keys, huh?
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:45.160]   Nice.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.320]   I love it.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.400]   All right, Mike Yelgin, you wanted
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:52.920]   to talk a little bit about YouTube's recommendations.
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:53.440]   Yeah, so--
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.560]   This is a big problem.
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:55.200]   Yes, it is.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:01.200]   So people believe it's a kind of a consensus in the public sphere
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:04.440]   that YouTube algorithms radicalize you.
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:09.640]   So let's say you're interested in Legos.
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:11.280]   I'm trying to pick a fairly non-venture version.
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.280]   Something non-venture version.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:14.480]   But imagine something horrible, but like,
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:15.920]   start with Legos.
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:18.720]   And you see a nice Lego video.
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:22.640]   And the idea is that the recommendations take you deeper
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:26.360]   and deeper into a rabbit hole of content in that sphere,
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.320]   no matter what it is.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:32.360]   So if it's politics, and let's say you're left leaning
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.880]   a little bit, OK?
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:36.720]   The videos will take you left and left and left and left
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.640]   and next thing you know, you're Trotsky.
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:39.140]   Right.
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:42.240]   Watching videos about radical revolution and all this kind
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:42.720]   of stuff.
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:45.200]   Or if it's about violence, or if it's about sex,
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:49.280]   or if it's about any sort of political topic.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:52.960]   It was a year ago that Zanepteflexi
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.480]   wrote about this in the New York Times.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.840]   Her op-ed piece was YouTube, The Great Radicalizer.
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:01.840]   And she gave a lot of examples that she did herself.
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.600]   She experimented with it.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.680]   That you would watch one video and then the next recommendation.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.880]   By the way, there's of course a number of ways
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:12.320]   Google YouTube recommends.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.520]   One is with a list of videos.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.720]   But there's always that play next one.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.320]   And she was saying the play next one often
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.960]   gets more and more radical.
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.880]   So if you start looking for keto diet recipes,
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:27.760]   then you get vegetarian recipes, then you get vegan recipes.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.840]   That's kind of how it works.
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.240]   And she had a lot of examples in her piece.
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:38.760]   Well, the Verge has apparently blown the lid off of this.
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.120]   Because when employees reported or complained about it,
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:46.400]   or mentioned toxic videos--
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:47.960]   this is from-- actually, I'm sorry.
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:48.680]   It's not the Verge.
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:50.280]   Let me give credit to where credit's due.
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:52.840]   It's Bloomberg.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:56.200]   And then those employees, those YouTube employees,
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.400]   warned executives.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:00.200]   The executives said, meh.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:01.480]   OK, never mind.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:09.640]   This is a big problem that YouTube's known about it
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.200]   and hasn't done anything about it is a huge problem.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:14.440]   Stop this thing, Google.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.920]   Your phone is going.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:19.120]   But worse than that, a YouTube executive
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.960]   has denied the--
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:22.800]   The recommendations.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.240]   The rabbit hole effect even exists.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.680]   They denied the whole thing.
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:28.120]   And I'm trying to bring up the story,
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:31.720]   but I think I have also turned off data.
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:33.920]   Was it logistic that denied this or anything?
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.680]   No, no.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:37.280]   It was another executive.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:40.400]   In fact, well, I have stories galore along this.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:44.920]   YouTube has decided to leave Neo-Nazi propaganda online.
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.880]   They've marked it, but they haven't taken it down.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:52.360]   And I saw a conversation talking about how--
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:56.440]   so there's white supremacy, and then there's white nationalism.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:59.440]   And Facebook has finally decided that white nationalism equals
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.040]   white supremacy.
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:04.000]   Exactly, which the white nationalists are not happy about.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.320]   No, no, we're not better.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.560]   We're just white.
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.080]   This is the problem.
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:13.200]   When you have Mark Zuckerberg making this decision--
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.520]   Here it is, New York Magazine.
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.200]   By the way, they've been doing a great job.
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.280]   These intelligence or common columns in the New York
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.600]   Magazine are really good.
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.040]   YouTube executive denies the existence of rabbit hole
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.120]   effect that definitely exists.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.280]   This was in the New York Times.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:30.880]   It's Neil Mullen, who is a chief product officer at YouTube.
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.720]   They said, the company does not have a business interest
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.920]   in pushing users towards extreme content.
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.520]   Quote, it's not the case that extreme content drives
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:42.320]   a higher version of engagement or watch time
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.640]   than the content of other types.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:46.960]   It's just that, gosh.
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.400]   The gosh was added by intelligence.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:51.880]   Gosh, YouTube is just so vast, and it's so tough to balance
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.760]   user safety and information integrity
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:56.720]   with concerns about freedom of speech.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:58.000]   We just can't help it.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.920]   And it's worth noting that the reporting on this
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.960]   has cited a lot of facts and evidence.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:06.280]   And Mohan has not produced any data or facts
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.800]   to support his claim.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.560]   It's just a claim.
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:10.600]   It might be true.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:11.240]   It's possible.
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.480]   But so far, the weight of evidence
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:14.280]   is in favor of rabbit hole.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:19.320]   Here's a BuzzFeed story from January.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.080]   They want to know how many clicks through YouTube's
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.360]   up next recommendations.
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:26.760]   Does it take to go from watching a anodyne PBS clip
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:29.320]   about the US Congress to an anti-immigrant video
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:32.160]   from a designated way eight organization?
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.320]   Nine degrees of separation.
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:37.280]   So they started by watching a day in the life of an Arizona
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.080]   rancher.
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.280]   How a bill becomes a law.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.720]   Wow.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:46.160]   Oh, actually, that was the end result.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.080]   It's top comment, illegals are our enemies, flush them out,
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.880]   or we are doomed.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:53.600]   So--
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.240]   I've heard about this kind of stuff,
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:58.600]   but I've yet to experience it with my YouTube habits.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:01.600]   But you wouldn't let your kids--
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.000]   so this is the real problem.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.880]   People often sit their kids down in front of a YouTube video.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.760]   And then if auto plays turned on,
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.320]   it just keeps playing the next video,
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:12.600]   and the next video, and the next video, and the next video.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:15.320]   Yeah, I need to check with my hard heads,
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:19.280]   because one in particular, my youngest one,
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:22.280]   he watches YouTube almost as much as I do.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.920]   I mean, that is our television.
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:29.080]   And I have a good idea of the creators
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:30.480]   that he's watching.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:32.440]   I don't know their names, but I know their faces.
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:35.040]   And I can hear their, OK, guys, OK, guys.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.800]   So I know he's watching the same crap over and over again.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:42.320]   But I wonder if he's getting fed this little algorithm
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:43.520]   that everybody else is getting it.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.160]   I'm not.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:48.360]   Here's one example from BuzzFeed.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:52.760]   So first, they searched for government shutdown 2019 explained.
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.040]   They got a clip called Partial US Government Shut Down
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:58.200]   Expected to Continue in 2019 from EuroNews,
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.920]   a channel with 700,000 subscribers.
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:01.200]   So they hit that.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.840]   Then the recommendation algorithm suggested a live
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.680]   President Trump press conference video
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.600]   from another news aggregation channel,
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:10.320]   from there, videos about the Mexican border,
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.240]   Trump's proposed border wall.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:15.200]   Then up next, recommended a video from an immigration news
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.920]   aggregator featuring a compilation of news clips
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:20.960]   titled Border Patrol Arrests Deportations, Border Wall,
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:23.200]   and Mexico's Sewage.
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.200]   From there, algorithm took an abrupt turn
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.760]   recommending a video about Miami International Airport.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.280]   Then a series of episodes from a National Geographic TV show
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:35.840]   called Ultimate Airport Dubai.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.200]   Snakes, firefighters, customs officials,
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.120]   crystal meth, and faulty planes.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:46.480]   So in a way, this confirms what the YouTube guy was saying,
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.960]   which is, well, we're not intentionally getting more extreme.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.640]   Really, the problem is there a search,
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:54.400]   a recommendation, the algorithm sucks.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.000]   Got to train it.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:56.880]   It's just isn't good.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.480]   I hire some AI trainers.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.080]   If you search for impeach the mother,
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:09.080]   or impeach the mother, I don't know how you would impeach the mother.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:11.560]   Never mind.
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.440]   Enough, you get the idea.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.840]   I don't even want to go down this rabbit hole anymore.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:17.760]   So it's a problem.
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.640]   To me, the problem, yeah.
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:24.640]   So a lot of this speech that's being banned on social networks
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:30.120]   and YouTube is constitutionally protected speech.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.320]   So the government couldn't ban it.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:35.960]   But any private business can do whatever it wants.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:38.680]   Twitter can ban anybody it wants.
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:39.680]   Right.
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:41.360]   And they're the arbiters.
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:47.360]   And I just think it's problematic because of the rabbit hole effect
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:50.400]   is essentially an algorithmic thing run amok.
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:54.680]   You can't really understand what algorithms are going to do at this scale.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:56.320]   I don't think.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:59.760]   And as Zuckerberg said when he was being grilled by Congress,
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:04.960]   "Oh, don't worry, within a few years we're going to have AI that's just going to make all these decisions
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.240]   behind the scenes and never have to worry about this again."
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.680]   That's Silicon Valley and punt.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:11.080]   If that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside,
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:14.440]   you've been drinking the same stuff we have because...
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:18.960]   Silicon Valley has a couple of default positions they punt to.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:19.960]   That's one.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:20.960]   Yep.
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.960]   The AI will solve it.
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:22.960]   Yep.
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:25.080]   The other one which is becoming more popular is,
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:28.240]   "Oh, don't worry, universal basic income will solve it."
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.240]   Right.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.240]   Everybody is.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.240]   Right.
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:32.240]   A few thousand dollars a month.
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:33.240]   Right.
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:34.600]   And I will do all the work.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:38.200]   People are basically worthless and just want to sit at home spending money
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.200]   away at the moment.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.240]   So we'll pay him $3,000 a month to do that.
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:47.480]   Where that money is coming from, I don't know.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:48.480]   You forgot the...
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:50.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:51.640]   Well, yeah, that's right.
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:52.640]   That's it.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.440]   Yeah, we're sorry.
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:57.680]   We didn't mean to do that.
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:00.240]   It was a bug.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.240]   So easy to...
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.840]   Silicon Valley actually has more excuses than anything else.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:05.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:06.840]   It was only a few of you affected.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:07.840]   Not everybody.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:10.920]   They've become incredibly adept.
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:12.960]   You know what they're like?
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:16.560]   They're like those preachers who say the world's going to end next month.
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:17.560]   Right.
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:18.720]   And then it doesn't end.
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:23.080]   Those preachers become really good at coming up with excuses for why the world didn't end,
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:24.080]   but it's going to end.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:29.880]   And if you want to see this firsthand search YouTube for Harold Camping, Harold Camping,
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:30.880]   and he's in the Bay Area.
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:31.880]   He's one of the...
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.520]   He's been saying the world's going to end for years.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.520]   But he...
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:38.640]   You realize at the end that he actually believed it because he gave actual date and he's like,
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:41.800]   "Here comes, it's going to be Tuesday and of course Tuesday, nothing happened."
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:42.800]   And then anyway...
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:43.800]   What does he...
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.960]   Does he wake up on Wednesday and say, "Oh crap."
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:49.600]   The world didn't end.
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.360]   And then what is he...
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.360]   Right.
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.040]   I don't know.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:59.640]   It's funny, but in YouTube's defense, I think the vast majority of people who are listening
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:03.480]   to this, it's probably the greatest resource.
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:08.360]   If you wanted to encapsulate humanity and all of its knowledge, YouTube wouldn't be
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:09.360]   a bad resource.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:14.440]   I mean, if you want to learn how to fix your garbage disposal...
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:15.640]   No, YouTube is a huge...
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.640]   YouTube is fantastic.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:17.640]   Valuable resource.
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:18.640]   Right.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:19.640]   We don't want to get rid of it.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.640]   No.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:23.240]   We just want to kind of maybe some oversight.
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:24.240]   Maybe do it right.
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:25.920]   But maybe this is an impossible task.
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:26.920]   I don't know.
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:27.920]   I don't know.
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:28.920]   Yeah.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.680]   YouTube seems to think it is.
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:34.160]   I just think...
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.920]   One last point on this.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:41.320]   The companies like Google and Facebook and others will say, "Oh, it's just the algorithms.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.640]   They're just doing their thing.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:43.640]   We have such scale."
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:45.880]   Why do we need these algorithms?
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:47.400]   Why do we need so much automation?
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:51.720]   The reason they love algorithms is because they're measuring what people are looking
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:54.720]   at, how long they're watching, what they're clicking on, where they're going.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:59.640]   And they believe it's monetizable because they learn about who you are.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.440]   It makes a very sticky product.
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:03.280]   And they sell products to you.
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:08.440]   Plus, humans are expensive and there aren't, frankly, enough humans in the world to monitor
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.520]   all the crap that's being posted on YouTube.
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.240]   But it's an old-fashioned concept.
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:15.600]   But I would actually love it if YouTube didn't have any algorithms.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:17.440]   Just search algorithms.
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:18.920]   That's the solution.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:19.920]   Let me search...
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.920]   What's the solution?
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.880]   That's attempt to monetize better.
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:23.880]   Don't do the record.
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:24.880]   Just turn it off.
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:27.000]   That's an easy solution.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.960]   There's an unspoken assumption that we have to let these companies invade our privacy,
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:35.280]   get to know us so they can make trillions and billions of dollars.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:36.960]   Why do we support that?
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:42.280]   Why are we so invested in the Googles and the Facebooks becoming even larger than the
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:43.280]   algorithms?
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.280]   Turn off the algorithms.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.280]   Because they're not working.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.280]   Turn them off.
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.280]   And of course, technology is responsible.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.280]   No, no, no, no.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:49.280]   We're just going to make them better.
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:50.280]   We're going to make them work.
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:52.440]   We're going to get to do it.
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:53.720]   I think that's interesting.
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:58.440]   Would YouTube be any worse if the next video didn't autoplay, if it didn't recommend a whole
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.440]   bunch of...
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:02.600]   No, you just search for the next one you want to see.
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:05.160]   And put an ad there on the page.
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:08.520]   They make just as much money.
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:09.520]   Or maybe almost as much.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.760]   I mean, they wouldn't be as sticky except I think they would because you're there for
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.480]   the value you get from it.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:17.080]   And there's genuine value there.
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:21.840]   I've never seen a relevant ad ever coming from Google.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:24.920]   The only site that does that well is Instagram to me.
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.360]   Oh, they do it really well.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:27.600]   Everything they advertise.
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.600]   I want it.
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:29.600]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.120]   They've gotten a lot better.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.120]   They...
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:33.120]   I don't know what that's why.
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:35.760]   Actually, I mean, I talk about a lot of other reasons.
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:38.720]   But the main reason I left Instagram is I was buying too much.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:39.720]   I know.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:40.720]   It was like...
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:41.720]   Work too well.
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:42.720]   Oh my God.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.680]   I'm wearing my Instagram underwear today.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:46.680]   It's bamboo, you know.
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:49.680]   Don't get a sliver.
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:51.840]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:53.960]   Okay, now we're at the bottom of the barrel.
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:59.240]   So there's a bunch of very just weird stories about, well, like that woman who entered
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:04.720]   Mar-a-Lago bearing four smartphones, two passports.
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:07.960]   I never thought China would be a country that would spy.
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:08.960]   A USB...
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:14.720]   She has two Chinese passports and a USB device containing malware.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:17.320]   She said, "I'm going to a pool party."
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:18.320]   So they...
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:20.480]   To the secret service.
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:21.480]   She said, "I'm a member.
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.360]   I want to use the pool."
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.360]   Showed the passports.
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.760]   Agent said, "Well, she's not on the membership list."
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.680]   But a club manager said, "I think she's the daughter of a member."
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:32.000]   So they let her in.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.760]   Turns out she had a little bit of a issue.
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:39.120]   Agents say when they asked Chang if the member was her father, she did not answer definitively,
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.320]   but they thought it might be a language barrier.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.320]   So they said, "I'll screw it.
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.320]   Let her in."
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:45.480]   It's a secret freakin' service.
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:49.320]   By the way, the president was there at the time.
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:53.560]   The thing with the secret service, and this is one of the problems with so much stuff
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:56.240]   happening at Mar-a-Lago, is that they're not...
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:59.200]   They have no right to block anyone from coming into Mar-a-Lago.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:00.200]   It's a public place.
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:01.200]   They keep you out of the White House.
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:04.160]   It's privately owned by the president.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:08.520]   So they're in this weird position where they're supposed to let people in, but they're also
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.440]   supposed to protect the president.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:11.440]   So...
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:12.720]   Yes, you could say, "I'm a member."
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:14.360]   It has nothing to do with anything.
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:16.600]   So once she got in, she told the front desk reception.
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.640]   She was there to attend the United Nations Chinese American Association event scheduled
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:21.640]   for that evening.
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:23.120]   There was no event.
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:25.520]   So that's when they called the agents.
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:26.960]   The agents told her, "No, I'm sorry, ma'am.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.840]   You have to use the spy entrance."
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:31.640]   And so go around back and get in line.
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:32.640]   Get in line.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:35.040]   Get in line with the other spies.
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:36.040]   Just wild.
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:40.160]   If she was a halfway competent spy, she would have just gotten in and installed the malware.
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:45.720]   She had four cell phones, a laptop, an external hard drive, and a thumb drive containing malware
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:47.720]   plus two passwords and no swimsuit.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:51.160]   See, if you're going to say you're going to a pool party, at least bring a swimsuit.
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:56.680]   How hard is that to buy a swimsuit in Florida?
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:59.880]   There's no indication she was ever near the president.
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:03.480]   So don't, you know, it's okay.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.720]   That's one, that's weird story.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.520]   Number one, weird story.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:11.800]   Number two, the Department of Justice has threatened the Oscars.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:17.120]   Finally, and without time we got the DOJ involved.
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:21.920]   The Department of Justice told the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, Steven
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.240]   Spielberg's been saying, "Oh, we can't give Oscars to streaming movies."
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:29.520]   They have to open it in the theater and that's the current rule.
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:35.920]   The chief of the DOJ's antitrust division, taken on the really big ones, McCann Delrahem.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:39.840]   Wrote to Ampass on March 21st to express concerns.
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:44.120]   The new rules would be written in a way that tends to suppress competition.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:53.760]   Yes, that big monopoly, the Academy Awards.
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.720]   I don't even know what to say.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.360]   I don't even know what to say.
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:02.680]   I agree, the DOJ's right, they shouldn't ban streaming movies, but I don't know.
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:03.680]   Is it a federal?
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.840]   They're kind of making a federal case out.
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.480]   Yeah, it's not, yeah, we don't need government intervention.
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:11.120]   The Academy Awards.
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:12.120]   It's an Academy.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:13.280]   They can give awards.
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.680]   Yes, you know what?
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:20.240]   If I wanted to give an award to podcasters, but it can only be podcasters who are five
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:24.040]   foot ten or higher or above, I could.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.400]   That's, I'd be okay with that.
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:27.240]   It's the tall awards.
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:30.640]   It's not illegal.
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:33.760]   And I think you actually have the right to do that.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:36.240]   And you know, and the other, I think I do.
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:38.840]   I think I would want to, but I could.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:40.880]   How tall are you in?
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:41.880]   Six, two.
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:42.880]   See, he's a supporter.
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:45.760]   I'm surrounded by tall people.
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:52.840]   You should actually have awards and give it to podcasters, but only if they're on the
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:53.840]   Twit Network.
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:56.080]   Okay, we all, you're all winners.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.080]   I'm in Arizona beverages.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.640]   You know, they make that the tea and the really tall cans.
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.160]   Yeah, you get a whole can.
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:07.160]   You get a whole can of tea, knocked offline by ransomware.
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:10.720]   They're one of the largest beverage suppliers in the US.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:15.520]   They're still rebuilding their network two weeks after ransomware hit wiping hundreds
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:21.400]   of Windows computers and the servers effectively shutting down sales operations for days.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:26.360]   More than 200 servers and network computers displayed the message, your network was hacked
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:27.880]   and encrypted.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:32.800]   The company's name was in the ransom notes, so this was a targeted attack.
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:33.800]   They put up the notices.
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:35.120]   We've seen them everywhere now.
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:40.360]   The little hand printed signs you put in the window saying, please don't power on copy
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.920]   files or connect to the network.
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:44.640]   Your laptop may be compromised.
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:46.760]   They never would have tried this against Red Bull.
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:48.760]   That's a good energy.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.760]   That's too much caffeine.
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:50.760]   Never have thought.
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:52.360]   Oh, and here's the best news.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:57.360]   A day after the attack hit, the staff found the backup system wasn't configured properly.
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:03.160]   We're unable to retrieve data for days until the company signed an expensive contract to
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:07.680]   bring in Cisco incident responders.
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:13.200]   They had to rebuild the entire network from scratch.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:16.800]   Since the outbreak, the company spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on new hardware software
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:19.480]   and recovery costs.
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:26.520]   There's a general war between hackers and malware distributors and the legitimate world.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:31.600]   I think the legit world is losing because there's so many stories about this kind of
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:32.600]   thing.
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:33.760]   MySpace, which I learned still exists.
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:36.920]   Oh my God, they lost all the music.
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:37.920]   Asus.
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:40.360]   You buy a brand new Asus computer and you have-
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.360]   Malware.
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:43.360]   Digital-y sent to it.
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.360]   Malware.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.840]   There's a lot of that going.
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:53.160]   I'm working on a piece right now about malware on legitimate authorized products, software
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.160]   and hardware.
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.160]   It's amazing.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:52:01.680]   It seems like that Asus had been hacked probably by a nation state.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.360]   They said it was an advanced persistent threat.
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:06.360]   In other words, the hackers are sitting in the network for some period of time.
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:10.760]   What was interesting about the malware, it affected many, many computers, but only 600
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:12.160]   were actually had a payload.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:14.280]   They had a list of Mac addresses that-
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:15.280]   All laptops.
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:18.920]   It sounds to me like something China would do.
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.400]   They're going after dissidents or-
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.800]   You could think of a lot of scenarios.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:23.920]   Let's say you're Saudi Arabia, not that they would ever hack.
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:24.920]   They wouldn't do that.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:29.320]   Let's say you're Saudi Arabia and what you did is you put a little sniffer outside the
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.720]   Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C.
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:36.520]   And copied all the Mac addresses of Asus laptops going into the building.
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:42.920]   You now have a list of Mac addresses and you implant malware in Asus and it affects only
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:43.920]   those computers.
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.920]   Right.
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:45.920]   Fish and a barrel.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:46.920]   Here, have some more.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:47.920]   Thank you.
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:52.200]   Finally, this is one that's got me all head up.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:56.440]   Andreas Gahl was on a business trip to Sweden.
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.280]   He is an Apple employee.
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:02.320]   He was carrying a MacBook and an iPhone XS.
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:09.720]   The both on the screen, the iPhone XS flashed on the lock screen confidential and proprietary.
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:15.160]   The MacBook Pro wrote for a sticker that said property of Apple proprietary.
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:20.680]   He was stopped by Customs and Border Protection at San Francisco International Airport.
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:24.240]   They ordered him to unlock the phone and hand it over.
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:26.360]   Gahl told him, "I can't do that.
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:27.360]   I don't own it.
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:28.360]   It's Apple's.
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:32.480]   I have to consult the lawyer or the employer because I have an NDA with Apple that specifically
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:35.560]   explicitly says I can't do that."
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:40.840]   He wrote in his Medium post, "This request seemed to aggravate the customs officers.
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:44.440]   They informed me I had no right to speak to an attorney at the border despite being a
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:49.240]   U.S. citizen and threatened me that failure to immediately comply with their demand is
[01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:53.120]   a violation of federal criminal code.
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:56.280]   They questioned him for about an hour.
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:00.320]   Let him go, but they stripped him of his global entry card.
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:06.040]   They also gave him a handwritten note with a supervisor's name and phone number and said,
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:07.960]   "Have your boss at Apple.
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:08.960]   Call it."
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:09.960]   Wow.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:17.240]   ACLU has filed a civil rights complaint over this.
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:18.800]   We've been hearing about this stuff all along.
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:20.800]   It doesn't happen all that often.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:23.680]   But Gahl's between a rock and a hard place.
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:29.280]   You don't want to mess with Apple.
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:33.720]   At the same time, you probably don't want to mess with armed border guards.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:39.040]   I don't know what the right answer is here.
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.880]   It's problematic.
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:46.720]   One of the benefits of having a pixel book, which if you're an Apple employee, you just
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:47.720]   do an Apple.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:48.720]   You just do an Apple.
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:52.040]   Before you travel and then just log back in when you get to wherever you're going.
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:58.240]   He might have been transporting data on that system that was Apple Secrets.
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:54:59.240]   Apple Secrets.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:03.960]   He's the former CTO of Mozilla.
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:07.200]   His US citizen actually a naturalized citizen.
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:11.560]   He said, "When I became a citizen, I swore to defend the Constitution."
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:16.960]   That's why I'm filing a civil rights complaint with the help of the ACLU for unlawful detaining
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:19.240]   and violation of my constitutional rights.
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:22.120]   It's good because we can get this into the courts and we can figure out what the rules
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:24.480]   are maybe.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:25.680]   We're going to see a lot more of this.
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:28.280]   This is in the US.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:30.480]   Every country has its customs agents.
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:32.600]   Frankly hard to get into Canada.
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:39.440]   I was detained leaving Morocco last time because we had 16 bottles of wine.
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:41.400]   I would have stopped you too.
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:43.400]   They're like, "Oh, that's way too far."
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:44.400]   I hope you handed one over.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:49.040]   They had to call the supervisor and they're like, "Are you allowed?"
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:52.200]   Apparently so because eventually they let us...
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:53.200]   We're like, "We're leaving.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:54.200]   We're not Muslim.
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:55.200]   It's fine."
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:57.440]   They were like, "Huh, that's a lot of wine."
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:59.360]   That's a lot of wine.
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:00.440]   Our wine isn't that good.
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:02.200]   What do you take 16 bottles for?
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:06.000]   Dude, when I left France, I had 27 bottles.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.400]   One of which was a Magnum.
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:08.400]   One of which was a Magnum.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:09.400]   Bring more.
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.400]   Would you like to take more?
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:11.400]   Please.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:12.400]   All right.
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:16.440]   We're going to wrap this up with your picks of the week.
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:20.880]   Aunt Pruitt from Tech Republic and a great friend.
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:25.280]   Get some plugs ready to queue up some good plugs because I want to...
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:27.280]   You come on and you do this and you're selling...
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.640]   I got plugs but I don't have any picks.
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:30.640]   Okay.
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:31.640]   Well, do plugs.
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:32.640]   No picks.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:33.640]   Well, I do have one.
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:35.640]   You got a minute because I got to do an ad.
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.240]   I'm going to give you my pick.
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:41.600]   Mike Elgin also here from Elgin.com and Gastronomad.net.
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:44.920]   My pick is really awesome and it's right here on this iPad.
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:51.320]   When you come to Twit, we for a long time, and if you've been here, you know this had
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:52.320]   a...
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:53.680]   How many pages was that thing?
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:59.480]   A long four page disclaimer and tiny print that you were supposed to read and sign.
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:03.600]   You know, a waiver that we won't sue us and you might fall over stuff and it's a dangerous
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.920]   environment where it takes your pictures.
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:11.160]   It was a long process and I've seen people standing at our desk with Moses who guards
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:13.840]   us for a long time.
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:14.920]   Now we got Envoy.
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:16.920]   This is awesome.
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:20.640]   By the way, so many companies in Silicon Valley are using Envoy.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:27.640]   It's an iPad kiosk that is a great way to sign in visitors, to protect the security of your
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.840]   environment.
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:33.280]   When visitors arrive, they sign in on this iPad.
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:34.280]   They enter their details.
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:39.880]   They sign any legal documents, NDAs, in our case waivers, right on the iPad.
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:44.800]   It then notifies their host, the person who they're visiting, automatically alerts them
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.280]   when your guest arrives.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:48.960]   So that's easy and they come down and get them.
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:50.800]   Your employee knows who's coming and when.
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:53.360]   No more like, "Oh, I didn't expect you, Dad."
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.360]   Hi.
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:56.800]   Kind of awkward meetings.
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:01.080]   Plus, this is smart security, but it doesn't intimidate.
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:05.520]   There's no more paper log book that really, honestly, what are you going to do, right?
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:07.480]   When James Rockford comes, you have to show them.
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:08.480]   I don't know.
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:11.000]   And so that's like 80s.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.600]   You could sign in unlimited visitors.
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:16.600]   Yes, you can connect it up to a printer to print customized badges.
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:21.000]   You can have VIP names automatically.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.080]   So like if the president arrives, you could send alerts out.
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:26.760]   He's here.
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:30.760]   And if there are unattended guests, it will notify security administrators, whoever you
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:32.200]   designate.
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:34.680]   It works perfectly with your existing security system.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:40.640]   So it can give Wi-Fi access, ID checks, emergency notifications, you get enhanced security.
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:45.080]   And best of all, you have a database of people who are visiting your office who's coming,
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:47.520]   you know, when they're on site, you know, who they're meeting, you know where they're
[01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:48.520]   R and Y.
[01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:53.280]   It already works with everything you've got, including Slack, Google Suite, Box, Salesforce
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:55.520]   Chatter.
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:59:02.120]   This is a really great, affordable, simple product and you can get it at onvoy.com/twit.
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:04.600]   Slackie uses this Pinterest Spotify.
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.680]   30 million visitors have been welcomed.
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:11.120]   We've added a handful ourselves using onvoy.
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:14.880]   Protect your people, your property, your ideas, but do it in a way that's nice.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:15.880]   It's welcoming.
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:17.280]   You don't want to look intimidating.
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:18.280]   Envoy is great.
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:23.240]   10,000 companies worldwide choose onvoy to make a great first impression.
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:26.560]   We're so thrilled to have an onvoy at our front desk.
[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:27.560]   Envoy.
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:30.360]   And we do it on an iPad mini, you notice.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:33.680]   Envoy and V-O-Y.com/twit.
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:35.400]   You can try it for free.
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:38.600]   It will work on your existing hardware, so that's awesome.
[01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:41.680]   Envoy.com/twit.
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:45.400]   We thank Envoy for setting this up, our modern front desk.
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:46.400]   It's a great mow, thanks.
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:47.400]   I'm too.
[01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:48.400]   He loves it.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:49.400]   Envoy.com/twit.
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:51.160]   Use that URL, let them know you heard it here.
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.160]   Thank you, Envoy.
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:55.080]   Okay, you can give this back to Mo.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:57.240]   Fortunately, nobody arrived when I was...
[01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:59.800]   There's a line of people just waiting for the iPad.
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:01.240]   The iPad to show up.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:06.440]   You've got the nice gold one, look at that.
[02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:07.440]   Yes, it's legally binding.
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:09.720]   Yes, you sign it with your.
[02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:15.480]   Yeah, so, Ant-Pruit, I gave you a minute or two to think about your pick.
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:20.960]   It could be whiskey, it could be rock and roll music, it could be the Clemson Tigers.
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:21.960]   Who do you like?
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:27.160]   Well, I mean, beyond the Clemson Tigers and the great things that they do for those kids
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:33.480]   down there in Clemson life and whatnot, I still wanted to continue to plug my friends
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:38.240]   community who I met through Google+, so many years ago.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:45.640]   Again, I think I've mentioned ammonia before, but my man, Charlie Hoover, on geekquestioner.com.
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:53.560]   He started a community on Google+, around just geek questions of the day, and it's not just
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:59.800]   Star Trek, it's not just Battle Star Galatica or Matt, it's everything.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:03.480]   Oh, this is nice, I like this.
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:08.440]   And half of the stuff I have no idea what they're talking about, but it's been fascinating
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:13.920]   to go through and look at those questions and look at what the responses are from the
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:15.600]   people in the community.
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:20.760]   And they put the questions out every single day, and you just go in there and comment
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:26.840]   to leave your response, and people have discussions on there, and they'll do a podcast every week
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:27.840]   about it.
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:29.240]   This is a great idea.
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:33.280]   And it's so fascinating because there's been a whole lot of things on there that I knew
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:35.280]   absolutely nothing about.
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:38.920]   You know, I didn't know what a Hufflepuff was.
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:39.920]   I do!
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:42.400]   You're not a geek.
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:43.400]   No idea.
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:44.400]   But there's so many...
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:45.400]   It's Hufflepuff.
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:47.280]   It's like that comes up.
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.440]   And I'm like, "What are they talking about yet?"
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:53.720]   sends me down a rabbit hole to go look at what a Hufflepuff is.
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:56.040]   And this is every single day.
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:02:00.080]   And he also shares what they call geekscapes.
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:01.080]   And they're just...
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:02.080]   These are beautiful.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:03.080]   Who does these?
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:04.080]   They're gorgeous.
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:06.280]   From different artists around the globe.
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:07.280]   And they're beautiful.
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:09.280]   Yeah, they're really nice.
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:11.280]   I look at this every single day.
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:14.560]   I don't answer the questions every day, but I look at them every single day.
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:20.560]   And it's just part of my routine and just takes me away from real life for a minute.
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:21.560]   Neat.
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:24.600]   But all of that started on Google+ many years ago.
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:26.640]   And he built a community with it.
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.200]   They left Google+ and they're doing it this way strictly through the website.
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.200]   Good for him.
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:32.920]   And it's doing really well.
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:33.920]   Question of the day.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:38.840]   What geeky nicknames have you given some of the tech gadgets in your life and why?
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:39.840]   Great question.
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:42.840]   Do you name your gadgets?
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:43.840]   I do.
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:48.200]   You know, Jerry Parnell started that for me in Bite Magazine.
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:50.640]   All his computers had names.
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:52.200]   My nickname...
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:53.200]   I have to...
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:54.440]   You have to name your Wi-Fi access points.
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:55.840]   So I give them all names.
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:58.720]   And I had been using Dead Rockstars.
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:04.240]   So I had Morrison, Joplin, Winehouse.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:06.320]   I really like Winehouse.
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.800]   You're a dryer.
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:09.000]   My dryer has a name.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.640]   What's your dryer's name?
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:11.640]   Fred.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:12.640]   Fred.
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:13.640]   Dryer.
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:17.920]   Whatever I've spent the most money on recently, I either go precious.
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:19.480]   Lord of the Rings...
[02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:20.480]   My precious.
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:21.480]   Yeah.
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.480]   That's my Samsung Galaxy S10.
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.480]   That's my precious.
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:24.960]   Or Excalibur from Wayne's World.
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:25.960]   Yes.
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:28.520]   But I use the same names over and over.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:29.520]   Yeah.
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:31.360]   But that's my piece.
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:32.520]   I love it.
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:35.400]   geekquestionner.com joined the community.
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:37.360]   It's there.
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:39.000]   Showing his guns.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.360]   That's guns.
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:41.360]   No, man.
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:42.360]   These are cannons.
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:44.960]   Look at this picture of Ant.
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:46.760]   Oh my God.
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:47.760]   You just...
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:49.640]   It's down at the bottom here.
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:50.640]   Let me...
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:51.640]   What are you...
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:52.640]   You're going...
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:54.440]   You look like the rock for crying out loud.
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:55.440]   Look at this guy.
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:58.080]   Do you want to meet him in a dark alley?
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:03:59.080]   No.
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:00.080]   Arrr.
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:02.600]   That's the least geeky picture of a geek I've ever seen.
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:03.600]   I know.
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:06.920]   Well, it just shows you you can be ripped and a geek.
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:08.480]   You can be.
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:09.480]   Wow.
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:10.480]   Arrr.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:11.480]   Thank you.
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:12.480]   Thank you, Ant.
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:13.480]   This is Matt.
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:14.480]   Google inbox.
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:16.980]   You know it cracks me up because he's about the sweetest guy ever met in the whole wide
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:17.980]   world.
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:20.600]   But he looks scary in that picture.
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:21.600]   Man.
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:22.600]   Arrr.
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:23.600]   Just the pose.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:24.600]   You know what?
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:26.200]   Big guys, I've discovered.
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:29.440]   Big guys are always sweet because they got nothing to prove, right?
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:30.440]   They can squash you.
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:31.440]   That's the thing.
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.240]   I tell people I don't have anything to prove.
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:34.240]   No.
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:35.680]   It's the little guys you got to watch out for.
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:36.680]   That's right.
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:37.920]   You can tell off in that picture.
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:39.840]   Notice the survival bracelet.
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:42.400]   So he's expecting the zombie apocalypse.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:43.400]   Is that what that is?
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:48.520]   Yeah, that's a paracord, braided paracord so that he can like, you know.
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:49.520]   Oh, you are a geek.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:50.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:51.880]   Somebody, I can't remember who gave me that.
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:57.160]   Right now I wear a breast cancer awareness bracelet.
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:04:59.760]   Yes, because for about two years now.
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:00.760]   For the mist.
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:02.800]   Strong men can wear pink.
[02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:05.000]   How's the mist is doing, by the way?
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.400]   She is slowly but surely turning into an internet star.
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.400]   Nice because our podcast people.
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:12.400]   Oh, that's right.
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:13.400]   Love her.
[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:14.400]   Yeah.
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:15.400]   Yeah.
[02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:16.400]   Ant and the misses.
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:17.960]   Plug that one.
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:20.200]   That's the podcast.
[02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:22.120]   Every day people doing every day shh.
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:25.080]   You have to fix that out.
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:27.160]   That's the name of our podcast.
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:28.160]   Stuff.
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:30.320]   Every day people doing every day stuff.
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:31.320]   That's correct.
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:36.740]   And it's you can find it on all of the different podcatchers, including Google, which at one
[02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:38.400]   time it wasn't showing up on Google.
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:39.400]   I don't know why.
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:42.000]   But yeah, it's out there.
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:47.840]   We just talk about everyday random stuff that we would talk about if the mics weren't
[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:48.840]   known.
[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:49.840]   Good.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:50.840]   Every scene.
[02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:51.840]   And it's doing well.
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:52.840]   Yeah.
[02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:53.880]   Been having some fun with that.
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:58.840]   And like I said, people are starting to know more about her.
[02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:00.840]   Dan Patterson, he's been listening to it.
[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:01.840]   Oh, nice.
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:06.320]   And he says, man, I swear I feel like I really know everybody in your house now.
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:07.320]   That's what you know.
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:10.200]   It's really the secret and strength of podcasting.
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:12.600]   It's intimate and you become friends.
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:13.600]   You've got something.
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:14.600]   Yeah.
[02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:17.680]   Sit back here on a Thursday night or something like that.
[02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:23.040]   I try to have it done by Friday and we'll just sit back over there in the corner and
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:25.000]   just just chat.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.000]   That's all it is.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000]   And for it.com/podcast.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:30.840]   That's it.
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:33.400]   Every day people, every day stuff.
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:35.960]   A podcast every day.
[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:36.960]   Every day?
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:37.960]   No.
[02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:38.960]   Every week.
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.600]   Every week people?
[02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:46.480]   Every week but we're doing every day shh.
[02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:47.480]   Mike Elgin.
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:48.480]   Okay.
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:54.080]   So I was going to use as my pick of the week Spark mail for Android because it's.
[02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:55.680]   Wasn't that a Google?
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:56.680]   No.
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:58.680]   They purchased it and killed it.
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:06:59.680]   No, no, no.
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:00.680]   Sounds familiar.
[02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:03.400]   This is a popular email.
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:09.080]   It's a company that has lots of mostly Mac based, iOS based.
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:10.920]   Oh yeah, I've used Spark on iOS.
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:17.880]   They're now on Android recently and they timed it to coincide with the demise of inbox because
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:19.880]   it does a lot of stuff in my store.
[02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:21.800]   That's the one you're thinking of.
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:22.800]   Yeah.
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:25.920]   So this has existed on Apple OS's for 12 years.
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:31.640]   It does stuff like smart notifications, email, pinning, like reminders, smart reminders,
[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:32.640]   stuff like that.
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:33.640]   But I'm not going to recommend it.
[02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:37.480]   I'm not going to recommend it because like dirty rotten bastard Ron Richards recommended
[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:38.480]   it on all about Android.
[02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:41.720]   I was listening to it on the way to the show and I'm like Richards.
[02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:42.720]   Richards.
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:44.880]   So I'm not going to mention it.
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:45.880]   All right.
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:52.880]   So instead I'm going to recommend something similar but more frivolous, which is a Google
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:53.880]   plus.
[02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:54.880]   I'm sorry.
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:55.880]   It's a Google.
[02:07:55.880 --> 02:07:56.880]   Last time I will ever say Google plus.
[02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:57.880]   No, no.
[02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:02.880]   It's a Chrome extension called inbox theme for Gmail.
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:08.120]   So it makes Gmail look like but have none of the functionality of inbox.
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:12.880]   So if you like the color scheme and the stuff like that, you can now have that.
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:14.240]   Oh, that's awesome.
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:15.240]   Yeah.
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:21.160]   Do you have the answer, you know, the question answers and all that stuff and like the smart
[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.720]   replies is what I'm trying to say.
[02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:24.520]   It doesn't have smart replies.
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.000]   That was a thing I like the best.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000]   Right.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:33.080]   It does prioritize your inbox and surface the most important things and it has smart notifications
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:36.080]   that will again, we're talking about spark not the.
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:38.640]   Oh, you're talking about spark spark spark.
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:43.520]   The thing I'm not recommending because Ron Richards already did it on all about Android
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:48.400]   has like it'll it'll only give you a notification if you have an incoming in box that's both
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:50.160]   important and from an important person.
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:56.480]   Oh, you can you can you can sort of not be spammed with notifications but also get
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:58.600]   notified when you have a really important email.
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:02.760]   So it's it's very intelligent has that sort of intelligent kind of helping you behind
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:08.080]   the scenes feel of inbox and it'll support all kinds of different platforms.
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:15.120]   So email from Microsoft, Google and other companies and you can put them all the email
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:18.360]   addresses, multiple email addresses into a single inbox.
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:25.520]   So it's a really intelligent, powerful thing that is just newly arrived on Android.
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:30.600]   There is a free tier but there's also a premium tier and they have enterprise but I think
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:32.560]   for the individual, the free is fine.
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:35.440]   Exactly because the paid tier is really for workers.
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:36.440]   Teams.
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:37.440]   So it's a lot of right.
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:42.600]   It's a lot of sharing functionality and stuff but the free version is full function for an
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:43.600]   individual.
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:48.720]   You know what would be interesting is to set up an email address for the family.
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:50.560]   Yeah.
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:54.680]   And then use the team features of spark because you can discuss something.
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:55.680]   Yeah.
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:57.440]   So you can have like almost a side chat during.
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:01.440]   So like if you had a family email address, all the stuff that you know, you have all
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:04.800]   the stuff for the family go there and then you could discuss it.
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:05.800]   Yeah.
[02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:06.800]   Treat your family like a team.
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:07.800]   Right.
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:09.440]   And that way if you don't like somebody you can just fire them.
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:10.440]   That's right.
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:12.040]   Junior, you're fired.
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:14.140]   You're fired.
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:17.960]   Spark is at sparkmailapp.com.
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:24.400]   It was desktop now available on Android and the Chrome extension is at the Chrome Web Store
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:25.400]   inbox theme for Gmail.
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:27.080]   Just search for it on the Chrome store.
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:29.480]   Make it you know, at least this takes some of the sting out.
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:31.120]   Makes you mail look better.
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:34.320]   It looks a lot better than it's like chewing gum when you quit smoking.
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:35.320]   Yeah.
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:36.320]   Something.
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:40.680]   This is the nicker ret of inbox nicker ret.
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:46.000]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, time to wrap this up.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.440]   And pro it.
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:48.440]   Great to have you.
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:49.440]   Always a pleasure.
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:50.440]   Come back anytime.
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:51.440]   You can see them on tech or public.
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:52.440]   Thank you for having me.
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:56.320]   Go to the@hotmail.com and TPRUITT.com.
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:59.880]   And if you're in the Charlotte area, get him.
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:02.240]   Get him for IT support.
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:03.240]   Right?
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:04.840]   That will be new.
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:05.840]   No.
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.960]   Don't ask him how that works.
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:09.680]   Why can't I print it?
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:10.680]   Oh my gosh.
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:11.680]   A printer's not working.
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:14.040]   I know I'm so tired of IT.
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:15.520]   I know.
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:16.520]   That's a hard job.
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:19.400]   That's all the respect in the world.
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:24.120]   I mean, I do get to look at old school 4G, L code.
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:25.120]   So that's fine.
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:31.480]   But still, I've had enough of IT.
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:32.480]   Thank you.
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:33.480]   Great to have you.
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:34.480]   Cheers.
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:36.480]   Cheers also to Mike Elgin.
[02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:39.200]   You didn't even show us this thing you've been doing this whole time.
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:40.200]   You should talk about this.
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:41.800]   Okay, so I've got a picture on here.
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:42.800]   He's got a joke.
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:43.800]   One of these great Joby tripods.
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:45.640]   By the way, that's the fancy one, which I really like.
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:47.880]   Yeah, I use this also for my DSLR.
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:55.840]   But the whole show I've been using the photo booth feature of the photo thing in Pixel 3.
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:56.840]   Oh, okay.
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:57.840]   Pixel 3.
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:00.760]   So whenever we smile and our eyes are open, it has taken a picture.
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:02.280]   Oh, so it's choosing the best pictures.
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:04.760]   And it says if you're smiling and your eyes are open, that's a good picture.
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:06.960]   It's using AI to see if everybody is smiling.
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:07.960]   And I just--
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:08.960]   This is kind of like the Google clip, basically.
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:10.440]   It's smarter.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:11.440]   Yes.
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:14.360]   And I've been using this in Mexico during our experience.
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:17.680]   And we're having a good time making tacos and learning to cook and stuff.
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:19.560]   And I just have it taken pictures.
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:23.480]   And all the pictures are great because it's like everybody's smiling.
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:26.280]   Are you talking about them in Mike's nice book?
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:27.560]   A few of them might be.
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:29.760]   We also have a link to the Mexico City experience.
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:33.680]   But a disproportionate number of my photos were taken using this feature.
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:34.680]   So I've been doing it today.
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:36.440]   So you don't actually have to take pictures?
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:37.440]   Right.
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:39.400]   So this is the Mexico City experience pictures.
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:40.760]   But these are not done that way.
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:41.960]   It's many of them are.
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:42.960]   Okay.
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:43.960]   So--
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:46.400]   And how do you-- can people get on Mike Elgin's nice book?
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:48.120]   Yeah, just go-- yes.
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:49.120]   How do you do that?
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:52.720]   You go to my blog or my Twitter feed at night--
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:53.720]   Elgin.com.
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:54.720]   Or my Facebook feed.
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:57.280]   And I occasionally promote the nice book.
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:12:58.280]   Oh, no.
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:12:59.280]   This is--
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:00.280]   Now I'm the hungry book.
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:01.280]   It's great.
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:02.280]   Oh my god.
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:04.040]   I got a lot of food in there.
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:05.040]   So yeah, this is my nice book.
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:06.040]   Oh, man.
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:07.040]   Come on, man.
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:08.040]   Come on, man.
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:09.040]   All done automatically.
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:11.520]   So those are churros from Puyol.
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:13.360]   These are churros?
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:14.360]   Yeah.
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:16.680]   I never saw a round churro.
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:19.200]   If you're familiar with the chef's table, you know about Puyol.
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:20.200]   Oh, yes.
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:21.200]   Yeah.
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:23.280]   I have that on my-- I love chef's table.
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:25.080]   That's a great show.
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:26.080]   Oh.
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:27.080]   Great show.
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:28.080]   Yeah.
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:31.120]   But anyway, so for-- if you get together with friends, you don't want to be taking pictures
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:34.000]   of people while you're having fun, having drinks.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.520]   But you put this camera on.
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:36.520]   So--
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:37.520]   Is this one of them?
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:38.520]   That might be one of them.
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:39.520]   Let go and let Google.
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:42.360]   There's no photographer in this.
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:43.360]   It's not required that everyone.
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:45.600]   I think more than half of them are smiling.
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:47.360]   Here's another one.
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:48.360]   Yeah.
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:49.360]   Look at that.
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:50.360]   And so-- and you want to take a selfie.
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:51.840]   You're like, everybody just look at the camera and smile.
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:52.840]   Boom.
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:53.840]   Selfie's done.
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:54.840]   You lightly get up.
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:55.840]   I love this.
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:57.600]   It's a great feature that a lot of people don't think about.
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:58.600]   So--
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:13:59.600]   Yeah, I'd done right.
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:00.600]   Yeah.
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:01.600]   Absolutely.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:02.600]   No, and really, this is a great way.
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:05.120]   Because you're all together and you have to get the waiter to take a picture.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:08.680]   So the picture in the upper left-hand corner-- this is a birthday party we're selling.
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:12.360]   That's my friend Lenny who was with us in the Mexico City experience.
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:13.360]   Big smile.
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:14.360]   That was automatic.
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:16.280]   And it even got the rocket going off.
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:17.280]   Yeah.
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:20.080]   And this is right before Lenny's beard burst into flame.
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:21.080]   Exactly.
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:22.080]   Right.
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:23.080]   This is before the accident.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.080]   Before the accident.
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:25.080]   Last picture of Lenny before the accident.
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:26.080]   But it's a good one.
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:29.560]   Any pictures of the screaming or the crying or--
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:30.800]   So what's that feature called?
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:32.120]   It's called photo booth.
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:33.120]   And you just--
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:35.560]   You go on the camera on the pixel and you say photo booth.
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:39.320]   And you go to-- you go to more and then you photo booth and you just let it run.
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:41.880]   And it just takes great pictures automatically.
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:42.880]   Yeah.
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:44.120]   This was not one of them.
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:47.040]   That was my Sony.
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:48.520]   But that churro does look good.
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:49.520]   It does.
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:50.520]   It's great framing.
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:51.520]   Yeah.
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:52.520]   Ah, no, this is great framing.
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:53.520]   It's sugar.
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:56.560]   That is great framing.
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:01.400]   That is a food I will never again be able to eat.
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:03.600]   Every time I see something like that, that's what goes through my mind.
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:04.600]   You could eat that.
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:05.600]   Don't worry.
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:06.600]   I got you covered on the diet.
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:07.600]   All right.
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:08.600]   Thank you.
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:09.600]   I want to look like you.
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:11.920]   Can't prove it, Mike Yelgin and you.
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:12.960]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:17.720]   We do this week in Google Wednesdays, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2030 UTC.
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:18.960]   Come by and say hi.
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:21.760]   You can watch or listen live at twit.tv/live.
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:23.840]   We have a few streams for you to choose from.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:26.080]   If you're doing that, go into the chat room.
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:27.080]   They're nice people.
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:28.080]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:31.760]   Love the chat room.
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:32.760]   They're great, aren't they?
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:34.040]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:38.720]   And then if you-- you know, you work in or something, you know, you can always get a copy
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:41.520]   of the show on demand so you can listen at your leisure.
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:47.160]   Just go to twit.tv/twig or subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:49.480]   I'm going to go away for a little while.
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:51.120]   This is my last show before vacation.
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:52.920]   I'll be in Hawaii for the next week.
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:54.880]   Jason Hall will be taking over the show next week.
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:56.920]   I've got people hosting all throughout the week.
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:16:00.880]   So the show's, of course, will go on.
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:05.800]   And I'll see you back here sometime in the distant future.
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:07.800]   I don't-- I actually remember.
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:08.800]   Someday.
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:10.960]   No, it's-- I'm only going for a week.
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:11.960]   Thanks, everybody.
