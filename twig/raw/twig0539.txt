[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:18.000]   Is it going to change the world or is he just going up and smoke? Does Motherboard have it out for ring and New Orleans narrowly avoids a ransomware nightmare?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.920]   It's all coming up next. Twig.

[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.320]   And today we are going to cover Google, but also some other stuff because Stacey Higginbotham, IOT Guru is here. Hello Stacey.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.320]   Hello.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.320]   From Stacey on IOT.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.320]   And you are going crazy because there's some big news coming out here.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.320]   And I know you're trying to cover it for your newsletter and your blog at Stacey on IOT.com.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.320]   But we're going to get to that real soon. And I do want your opinion on all this also sitting next to me and Pruitt.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.320]   Yes.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.320]   From F.A.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.320]   Focus on photography and hands-on photography.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.320]   That's correct sir.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:12.320]   Yes, our photography guy and our twigger. And also here Jeff Jarvis, Professor of Journalism at CUNY. It's great to have all three of you.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   Let's start three and a half. We have three and a half.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.320]   Karsten now has his own light and camera.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   Hello.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   And that's the Karsten. He's coming to us from the Karsten Fort.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.320]   The Karsten Corner.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   Karsten Corner.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.320]   It's Karsten Corner.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   Oh, I was going to say the Karsten Cave.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.320]   We should do the little Karsten Corner.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.320]   Karsten Corner. That would be a fun bit.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.320]   And now Karsten's Corner.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.320]   What's all this about Facebook and politics?
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   New segment.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.320]   He's not Andy Rooney. Come on.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   Oh, he's kind of a young Andy Rooney actually.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.320]   He is exactly what he is.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   Yeah, that's exactly what he is.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   Exactly what he is.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   So what happened? Zigbee, Google, Apple and Amazon walked into a bar.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:04.320]   This is something you would never expect in a million years and said we're going to work on a standard for home-connected IoT.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.320]   Oh, I like how you're getting this in right before I fall asleep from having worked all day on this.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.320]   Yeah, this is a huge story.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:23.320]   It was a big story for the industry and what they're basically saying is they're going to create an application layer essentially for the smart home.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   And it's going to be called connected home on, oh, sorry, connected home over IP.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   Which, by the way, is chip.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   Chip, yes.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.320]   Which I didn't realize until we were actually recording our show and I'm like, it's connected home over IP.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   Hey, this project chip.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   There will be a logo, but this is the thing that little bit disturbing.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.320]   It won't be till 2021.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.320]   Well, it won't be until 2020.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.320]   So they are not.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.320]   So what they said is they're going to build this together.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   All is a group and there's great people in this group including Samsung, IKEA, signify, which is coming behind Philips Hue.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.320]   So you're all going to make the devices.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.320]   Well, they're going to make chip certified devices.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.320]   The thing about chip is what it looks like it's going to be for sure.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.320]   And then there's some maybe's coming up for sure.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   It is going to be device schemas.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.320]   So a way for devices to identify a device.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.320]   So if it's a light bulb, it'll be like, I have a light bulb.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   I can turn on.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.320]   I can turn off.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.320]   I can dim.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.320]   I can change colors.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.320]   Whatever a light bulb can do, right?
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   Right now you have to build that individually for each company.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.320]   So if you wanted to work with Amazon schemes, you build, you basically build the software for Amazon.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   Then you build it for Apple HomeKit and then you build it for Google Home.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   What they're saying is they're going to create all of that is going to become standard.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:05:02.320]   They sound really familiar because we actually already have something that was trying to do this created by Qualcomm and then it was co-opted by Intel and it's called the Open Connectivity Foundation.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.320]   But Amazon, Apple and Google never really signed up for this.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.320]   This was historically the problem with home automation.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   Going back more than a decade, I would go over to the home automation pavilion at the Consumer Electronics Show and there was Zigbee.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   There was Z-Wave and there were a half dozen kind of smaller players.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   Nobody talked to anybody else.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   And it was apparent to anybody who was looking at this that no one's going to do home automation if there are competing standards.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   But you've all seen the XKCD cartoon about standards.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   I'll pull it up.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:49.320]   But I think is this just going to be another standard or are these guys really going to finally solve this tower of Babel?
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.320]   Yes and no.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:59.320]   So yes, that this is a way to solve a lot of the issues that plague the smart home.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.320]   I do think that this is going with all of these players.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.320]   I do think this is real this time.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   Now we finally basically said, oh, this is how we want it to work.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   We want all of these low powered devices to have access to IP networks and talk to them directly.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.320]   But mostly they're going to go through a hub, whether that's a Google home or maybe it's a smart things hub, whatever.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.320]   So that's the core of what they've decided is it matters.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:40.320]   So this is going to be a radio agnostic all at the application layer.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:49.320]   The question then really becomes if you're like a manufacturer of devices participating this, where is your innovation going to come in?
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   Is it going to come in on the light bulb or the door lock side?
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   Because the software experience, the basic how things work together, that's now going to be taken up by the standard.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.320]   And that's what people sell right now.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.320]   Here's the SKCD.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   How standards proliferate?
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.320]   I should point out this is 10 years old.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   This is nothing new.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.320]   Situation.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   There are 14 competing standards.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   14, ridiculous.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   We need to develop one universal standard that covers everyone's use cases.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.320]   Soon.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   Situation.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.320]   There are 15 competing standards.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   And that's the risk here.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.320]   The other question Stacey is why would Google and Apple and Samsung do this?
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.320]   Up to now they've been siloing their own efforts because they didn't want to interoperate.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   Because they realize that it sucks right now.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.320]   We've been telling them that.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:51.320]   They're finally like, oh, we can't build this just like the mobile ecosystem with the two players and people getting control and us making lots of money.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   We're going to have to redo this.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.320]   So that's basically what happened.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.320]   And I think getting Apple on board was a big deal.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.320]   And I don't know.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.320]   Let's see if you've seen it.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.320]   But basically Apple this morning, open sourced home kit.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.320]   Wow.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.320]   It is on.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   It is on GitHub.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.320]   So let me pull my GitHub thing and drop it in the home kits protocol.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.320]   Is it their own thing?
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   Well, is it.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.320]   Or is it not even at the protocol layer?
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   It's not a.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   It's really a way of managing.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.320]   Yes, they call this a protocol, but it's technically not a protocol.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.320]   This is actually going to be.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.320]   It's a data schemas.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   It's open data schemas for devices.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   So people don't know what a schema is.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   It's a description of the it's like a protocol.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:49.320]   It's a description of how you describe things so that we all agree that this is how you describe a switch is how you describe a light so that you can understand one another XML is a schema.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.320]   So there are HTML is a schema or has a schema.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.320]   It's not a schema myself.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   So that's a good step forward.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.320]   I have to say I am highly skeptical.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   Why are you?
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:09.320]   Well, so I and I just stuck the Apple the GitHub repository that was loaded uploaded last night.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   Okay.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   So that's a big step.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.320]   You don't see Apple just like throwing their stuff around usually.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.320]   But this is stuff you used to have to pay for.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   Why would you be skeptical on this?
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   Well, because these companies are hereditary enemies and they've never worked together up to now.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.320]   And as soon as you know, this is how standards processes work.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.320]   You get these big companies in the room.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   They think they start thinking, oh, this is going to be great.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.320]   It's going to be benefit everybody.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.320]   Customers want it, we want it.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.320]   Then it starts to let's write the protocol and Samsung says, well, you can't know.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.320]   And then Google says, well, wait a minute.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   And then in a year and a half, they're all going to go.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   Yeah, they want to do their own thing.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   I don't buy it that they really want to work together.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.320]   So let me ask Stacy, before you get all skeptical, which is your mode, Stacy, if this actually,
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   if chip actually works, what's possible that wasn't possible for?
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   I could buy a light.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.320]   Yeah, so I buy a light bulb today.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.320]   I have to choose like, if you're a light bulb maker, let's do it this way.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.320]   I can buy, if I buy a light bulb today, it's a dumb device.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:31.320]   And if I wanted to work with Google, Amazon, and HomeKit, I actually have to build a hub to handle all of that.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   Right?
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   And so I have to buy the hub for those light bulbs, right?
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:44.320]   Now, if I get a chip certified light bulb, the idea is it will work with HomeKit, Google, or Amazon's ecosystem.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.320]   Any other chip service?
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.320]   What is not enabled for the companies?
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   Right?
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.320]   So we're a consumer, absolutely.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.320]   For the companies, what can they now get into?
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   Well, so here's the thing.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   They won't have to spend the software development effort to make things for each individual ecosystem.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.320]   So there are like three or four, like there's the three main ones, but there's also like,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   Samsung SmartThings or IFT.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.320]   So now you no longer have to work to that.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.320]   You just work to one standard, it should theoretically work.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.320]   This is kind of like the flash of IoT.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   Oh, God, that's horrifying.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   Why would you do that?
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.320]   Why?
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   All that promise back of the day.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   No, it's like a really simple example.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.400]   no matter the brand, that the pump nozzle will fit into your
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.780]   gas hole and they will work together.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.100]   That's a standard, and in a way, the schema would be
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.020]   the description of, "Well the nozzle should be this wide,
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.920]   "this long, the flow should be this fast."
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.760]   And that's called interoperability.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.460]   And you have to have it.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.660]   And if somebody like Shell came along and said,
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.860]   "Well, no, we want-- we're gonna make a deal with GM
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.300]   "that only their cars will work with our gas nozzles
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.000]   "both GM and Shell electric cars."
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.920]   - They're like Tesla.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.960]   - Yeah, right now there's multiple charging standards,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.480]   but we're moving towards a standard CCS
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.320]   that everybody will adhere to eventually right now.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.160]   There are a few outliers like Tesla and Nissan,
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.920]   but everybody's gonna be CCS.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.960]   But so for some reason in home automation,
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.360]   this never happened.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.000]   And I mean, people have tried smart things.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.840]   Wasn't the smart things Hub designed to get through
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.640]   Zigbee and Z-Wave and everybody, right?
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.040]   - Well, it was designed to bring all the radio protocols
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.980]   together, that's where we thought this was gonna happen.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:41.980]   We thought this was gonna,
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.340]   the hubs brought the radio,
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.980]   all the different radios together.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.640]   And the application layer was gonna be handled by all join
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.460]   way back in 2012 when that was created.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.520]   Then it was gonna be handled by IOTivity.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.060]   Then Google, when they did Weave and Thread,
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.400]   that was their hope there.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.060]   - You see the problem here, folks.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.580]   (laughing)
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.620]   And Apple has their thing, right?
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.900]   Home kiddies their own.
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.240]   They never said that home kit was gonna be for anyone
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.340]   other than Apple, but that was actually a big,
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.480]   when they launched home kit in the MFI program
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.980]   for like home devices,
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.840]   they went through a very gradual process of being like,
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.680]   at first they were like,
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.800]   "There must be a hardware chip inside."
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.600]   And all the people building for this were like,
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.520]   "Apple, we love you, but that's just impossible for us to build.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.360]   That's crazy.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.900]   I'm not gonna make two light bulb.
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.640]   - So they moved to a software format,
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.280]   which is much more doable.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.880]   Now I don't know what Apple has posted here on GitHub,
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.480]   is merely a way for people to build home kit
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.100]   compatible devices.
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.760]   So it's not chip compatible devices I wanna point out.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.560]   It's to get people to make their light bulbs
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.960]   work with home kit.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.820]   So I don't know if this is,
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.040]   maybe they've never put it on GitHub before,
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.640]   but this is really a,
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.140]   this is just a development kit.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.320]   This is an SDK.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.420]   - Wait, you had to buy that first for awhile.
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.660]   - So they're giving it away with something
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.380]   that they bought before.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.220]   - And--
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.360]   - By the way, you have to do it on a Mac.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.200]   - No, you don't.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.800]   - Well, I was like, you have to do it
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.280]   and so you could only see this in Safari,
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.440]   just like their keynotes.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.200]   But what they're doing here,
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.000]   and this is, again, they just announced this.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.320]   So talking to people over at the bottom--
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.920]   - There is no Windows version.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.120]   You have to point out,
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.280]   well, I don't know if there ever will be.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.440]   And they use Homebrew for Linux and Raspberry Pi,
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.160]   which is not kind of how it works.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.360]   So that's a package manager
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.120]   not commonly seen on either platform.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.000]   So it's a Mac-ish.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.520]   So yeah, I mean--
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.760]   - But they're not promising the standard yet.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.480]   They're promising it for later in 2020, you guys.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.040]   So that's like so far away.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.040]   And getting these guys in the same room
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.120]   in agreeing to do this,
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.400]   Apple issued a press release,
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.640]   which is really rare for them,
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.440]   especially for not having something.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.800]   So they're serious.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.240]   But getting all these guys together was hard.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.960]   - It's gonna be the laggard, by the way,
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.200]   that promotes this the most.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.880]   They have the most to gain.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.440]   Amazon and Google have the least to gain.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.440]   So of course, Apple's gonna be, I think you could argue.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.280]   HomeKit. - I'm looking at your skepticism,
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.600]   and I get it, but I don't necessarily want to be
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.840]   totally skeptical about it.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.680]   But the first thing comes in my mind is the revenue share.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.680]   Is this gonna be a quarter, 25%, 25% for each person?
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.160]   - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, this is all open.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.260]   - This is just standard. - Oh, it's just a drop.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.600]   - There's no revenue. - This is a,
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.760]   there's no revenue share. - There's just by the way.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.520]   - There's no company here. - Part of the problem.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.460]   - Well, no, but even, but--
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.460]   - Everybody can make it.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.920]   They're one of these standard. - The amount of time,
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.840]   but far as the amount of time R&D wise
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.480]   going into the standard from--
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.720]   - They've already did the R&D.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.680]   So that's also really good here.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.140]   This is, I'm a little optimistic,
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.360]   because they're taking pieces that have already been built,
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.080]   and they're trying to shove them together
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.000]   in a way that works, and everybody agrees on it.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   - Is it more Zigbee than Z-Wave?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.880]   Is it more HomeKit than Zigbee?
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.420]   Is it more thread than that sort of thing?
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.860]   - My hunch is it's probably dot dot
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.620]   and the thread stuff that we've seen.
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.500]   So thread and Zigbee got together to create something
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.460]   called dot dot, and that is a schema associated
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.420]   with devices.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.940]   And so I think most of that's gonna be there.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.380]   - So you're, this is, you've been covering this field
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.180]   for a long time.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.340]   Are you optimistic about this, Stacey?
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.420]   - I'm optimistic that we will come up with a standard.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.780]   I'm very concerned about what this means
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.420]   for innovation and business models going forward,
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:41.600]   and how, I mean, on one hand, creating a standard
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.860]   is good because it does make things interoperable,
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.580]   and it gives you a baseline to which it's filled on.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.600]   - It's like having an operating system.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.900]   It's something everybody agrees on.
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.340]   - Yeah, so yes, 'cause that drives us forward.
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.020]   It's not the way I thought it would look,
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.360]   or I hoped it would look, but I'm like, okay, fine,
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.200]   let's do that.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.120]   And now I'm trying to see how it's gonna affect
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.960]   the different players.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.580]   - It's kinda like VHS Betamax.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.380]   We're now saying, okay, we're all gonna standardize on VHS.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.980]   The money, the revenue opportunity,
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.940]   is not in making VHS tapes.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.340]   Actually, there is an opportunity there
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.620]   because there's a standard.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.420]   There's more of an opportunity than if there's different
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.040]   standards, and it's much better for consumers,
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.460]   but also better for movie companies,
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.740]   'cause we now have an existing platform.
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.220]   So when you build that Hue light system,
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.580]   or the signified light system,
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.540]   or you build a doorbell or something,
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.100]   you make sure it's compatible with the schema.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.360]   It's chip compatible, right?
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.480]   But that schema's gonna be pretty high level.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.360]   - It is very high level, and that's the next thing.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.040]   We had been competing on, if you're a door lock maker,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.320]   you've made a connected door lock.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.880]   Most of them look pretty much the same, right?
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.200]   You've been competing on your software in UX layer.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.040]   And what this could do, and we're not sure yet though,
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.680]   'cause for example, in HomeKit,
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.400]   you have to be able to add a device to the network,
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.480]   to the HomeKit network, without having to download the app
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.880]   from the original device manufacturer, right?
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.880]   Apple did that to make it easy.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.160]   It's unclear if this will require that, right?
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.500]   So you may never have to make an app,
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.240]   which means there's gonna be tons of really,
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.560]   like low value kind of devices running around out there,
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.240]   and maybe the innovation all happens
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.120]   like at the AI UX level above that.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.920]   But that's where Amazon and Google
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.240]   have a pretty big stranglehold.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.000]   So that's where I'm like, hmm.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.880]   - They have an ecosystem stranglehold.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.440]   So that's the problem.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.080]   If you go Google, then you're gonna get a Google Nest Hub Max,
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.840]   and you're gonna get a Google Nest camera,
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.080]   and you're gonna get a Google Home doorbell and--
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:45.920]   - Eco.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.760]   - Because it's the ecosystem.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.720]   If I can mix and match, that's not good for Google.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.680]   That's not good for Apple.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   That's not good for Amazon, right?
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.400]   - Well, you will be able to mix and, well,
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.440]   you'll be able to pick what you'll be able to do,
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.640]   whatever your assistant.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.440]   - Right, but that's the end, they don't have a lock in.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.720]   So now, well-- - They'll lock in
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   at the assistant way.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.960]   So here's where the value lives now.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.040]   The value now lives at like,
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.680]   hey, if you have all this state data from locks
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.120]   and blah, blah, blah, what can you do with it?
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.000]   So maybe Apple innovates around privacy and security.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.440]   Maybe none of the state data your devices share
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.680]   goes beyond Apple.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.520]   Maybe in Amazon-- - There you go.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.680]   - You say, okay, I'm gonna get,
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.160]   take that state data in, I'm gonna offer you,
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.000]   I don't know, weird product discounts based on it.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.960]   - So there's plenty of area for innovation and different--
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.920]   - Well, here's another question.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.160]   - But is it innovation for everyone
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.840]   or is it just innovation for those guys?
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.840]   Okay, and now, just question.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.400]   - So, to try to deal with Leo's chronic skepticism.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.400]   What's the-- - I'm almost always right, by the way.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.280]   (laughing)
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.120]   You didn't know there was a threat emoji,
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.560]   it felt like 'cause you're not on Twitter or so.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.400]   - No one uses that, by the way.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.960]   After you told me, oh, the threat emoji,
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.280]   everyone knows that, I've been looking for it.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.760]   - There ain't nobody uses that.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.240]   - I'm just doing that on Twitter enough.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.400]   - See, you're still not on Twitter, you jerk.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.280]   (laughing)
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.840]   - I beg you, different.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.600]   - Anyway. - It says--
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.960]   - Anyways, you were saying-- - You were saying--
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.280]   - You're a thread here.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.400]   Show this thread.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.920]   You don't need a thread freaking picture of thread.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.360]   - It says, also, a newspaper emoji.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.480]   It's a nice newspaper emoji, I use that.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.320]   - Wait, there's a newspaper emoji?
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.400]   - What is that, there is.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.000]   - I discovered it from Der Spiegel.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.840]   - Oh, okay.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.560]   - Of course there's a, but I'm looking, I don't see them.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.040]   - Did Germans show me-- - I've seen the emojis.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.760]   - See emojis, okay. - Here's my question.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.920]   - Yes. - Heart.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.560]   - Oh, yeah, the hack need heart.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.800]   Hearts are everywhere.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.480]   - Oh, so here's my question.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.840]   Stacey, what's the market penetration
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.800]   of smart home stuff?
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.120]   Are people holding back because it's just too confusing,
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:54.960]   too much? - Right.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.600]   - Do they all, is it a rising tide question
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   that they're at a point where they're hitting a wall
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.200]   just on penetration?
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.440]   - They are, that is the reason why they've hit a wall
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.240]   or one of the reasons why is it's freaking difficult.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.520]   You do not know how many times someone says,
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.840]   "Stacey, I wanna buy a video doorbell.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.680]   Which one should I buy?"
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.880]   And then I have to follow up with,
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.760]   "Do you have an Amazon Echo or do you have a--?"
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.920]   - You have a template out.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.040]   (laughs)
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.640]   They re-type it that.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.280]   - It makes me really glad I never built
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.960]   the utterly impossible flow chart
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.520]   that Kevin and I have talked about for years.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.880]   Like, if I have this, what should I buy?
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.760]   'Cause it was just too difficult.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.200]   And this does away with all of that.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.880]   Maybe not all of it, but a lot of it.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.760]   - And Ms. Stacey, you and Mr. Kevin alluded to this.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.480]   I can't remember if it was here on Twig,
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.400]   a couple weeks back or if it was on your show,
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.600]   "Stacey and I OT."
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.160]   But are you surprised that this standard
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.360]   is actually coming to fruition?
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.120]   'Cause it seems like you sort of leaked it
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.840]   or maybe just sort of hinted that,
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.800]   "Hey, this is probably coming down the pipe."
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.440]   - We said we've needed one and every time they put one out,
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.360]   we're like, "Yay, let's let this be the one."
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.080]   But we always noted that we're like,
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.380]   "Oh, this one has Samsung, but it doesn't have Apple
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.200]   or this one has, you know, not a Manhattan."
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.000]   - Yeah, it's very frustrating.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.280]   And it's why the ecosystem play works
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.480]   'cause at least you know if I get it all from one vendor,
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.880]   it's all gonna work together.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.720]   - And I think also we've just hit this point
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.240]   where everyone thought this was gonna be amazing.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.240]   And even the big vendors, when you listen to the executives
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.840]   at Google and Amazon talk, they're like,
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.520]   "We are not finding compelling use cases
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.400]   to get people on board." - That's exactly the problem.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.840]   - That's really-- - You could say
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.640]   it's the Tower of Babel, which I've always thought it was,
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.880]   but honestly, once you start to do this,
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.360]   Stacey, you're one of the few people I know
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.200]   who's really done the automation thing.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.080]   You're one in a thousand.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.520]   Most people get some light bulbs and they go,
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.840]   "That's a lot of work."
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.440]   - I'm one in a million, you guy.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.200]   - Okay, one in a million.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.040]   (laughing)
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.000]   - Have you just had a curiosity though, you moved,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.320]   you disassembled that whole thing,
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.680]   how much of that has been put back together?
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.360]   - Probably 20 to 30%, that's it.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.800]   - Yeah. - And it was--
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.080]   - It was because I didn't, well, I was like,
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.000]   I'm gonna be here for 12 months.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.240]   Why would I spend three or four days?
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.080]   - That's fair.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.640]   - Which is to say it wasn't vital to your life.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.440]   It was nice to have an environment.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.960]   - And it was also my job.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.960]   I do not, like, I have become very aware
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.360]   that I was like, "God, this is my job."
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.360]   Right now, Kevin and I are doing something,
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.040]   you guys are gonna love it, everyone's gonna love it.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.280]   I'll just say, "Jit, we're testing,
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.320]   we're putting all of our IoT devices on a guest network
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.160]   so we can actually definitively say
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.760]   for a bunch of classes of devices
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.880]   what it means to make that sacrifice.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.240]   'Cause everyone's like,
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.040]   "If you have IT devices for security,
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:48.880]   put 'em on a guest network,
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.720]   not your main network."
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.560]   But that breaks the punch out. - First of all,
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.080]   everybody's wrong.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.040]   That is actually, besides breaking functionality,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.360]   it is no way protect you.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   Most guest networks on most devices are not VLANs,
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.600]   they're not isolated. - No.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.880]   - So you are gaining nothing by doing that
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.160]   and you're making it hard for yourself
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.520]   to access your device.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.480]   Really, the only way to do this is to VLAN it,
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.880]   and then the good news, you have to put your phone
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.880]   on that IoT LAN so you've gained nothing.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.400]   Basically, you should really have three networks.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.040]   - Even then? - Against network?
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.600]   Well, I'm sorry, a three actual--
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.480]   - Three routers, the three router solution,
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.000]   or you can buy-- - Oh, that's awesome.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.640]   - We tell people no, but that's a dumb.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.720]   The way to do it, there's a $50 box from Ubiquity
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.280]   called the Ever, or Edge Router X,
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.200]   and it has four ports,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.640]   each of those could be a discrete VLAN.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.160]   We do it here, VLANing is isolated.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.200]   You can't cross from one VLAN or the other.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.080]   But here's the problem,
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.400]   are my IoT devices are on LAN one?
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.400]   How do I control them?
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.480]   I have to put my computer or my phone on LAN one.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.320]   - On LAN one.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.680]   (laughs)
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.560]   - And that's-- - Now you're right back
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.240]   where you were. - You're the guest.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.840]   - By the way, I have two networks in my house.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.440]   I don't do that.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.400]   - Right, and we're doing it so we can show people--
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.240]   - Why it's dumb.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.800]   - Well, not just why it's dumb,
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.840]   but if you really wanna do it,
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.480]   here's exactly what you're going to lose.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.200]   'Cause sometimes that is hard to figure out.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.040]   - At the edge of the house.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.920]   - I do have two networks in your house though.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.520]   - I have Comcast business and Comcast consumer.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.520]   - Oh, oh, just don't get that.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.760]   - In our fine neck of the woods,
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.680]   I don't know where it is, the rest of you is,
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.640]   the Comcast consumer has a one terabyte per month cap.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.480]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.320]   - Do you know how long it takes me
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.480]   to use a terabyte of things?
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.680]   - Finding that out the hard way, myself, sir.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.720]   - It's awful.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.880]   These guys are so messed up.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.800]   And then, so I have a business class,
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.200]   which is a lot more expensive, but has no cap.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.040]   - Right.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.440]   - And so I try to, you know, do V stuff up.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.120]   - Why not just have the business?
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.200]   - Well, I probably should.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.920]   It's nice to have two networks.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.000]   - Yeah, back up.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.840]   - But the same company though.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.080]   - You know when Comcast goes down,
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:01.920]   yeah, that's not as hard.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.760]   - When Comcast goes down, they both go down soon.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.880]   (laughing)
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.520]   - This really help anything.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.880]   In fact, it just adds, you know,
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.800]   to Lisa saying, "Which network should I be on?"
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.040]   Well, right now I'm on one, maybe you should,
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.040]   it's just, it's not a good.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:17.960]   I'm lazy.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.720]   That's why.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.960]   - That cap surprised me.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.800]   It really did.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.640]   - Oh, isn't that awful?
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.480]   - Really?
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.000]   - And then they charge you, you know, like 50 bucks a gig
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.320]   a terra, I can't remember what it is,
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.960]   but they end up getting their money out of you.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.080]   That's for sure.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.440]   So, all right, I'm only skeptical because I,
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.760]   it's, it's, it's easy.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.040]   - It's the only, it's like, it's like a marriage.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.680]   It's easy when the romance is, the love is on the bloom
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.320]   and the blossom, but did you get these big,
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.640]   it's like a marriage with 10 people in it.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.480]   You know?
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.040]   (laughing)
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.440]   It's not good.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.120]   You get these people in the same room
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.640]   and they start saying, "Well, wait a minute,
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.000]   no, we're gonna do it this way, we're gonna do that way."
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.720]   I've seen these kind of standards committees.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.680]   This is a tough thing to get done right.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   And especially when each party has their own economic dog.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.600]   - That's not how much motive they have.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.760]   - Who has the most skin in and who's gonna, you know,
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.000]   I think this is a different animal.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.920]   I do think we're gonna get a version of this that will work.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.800]   And I think we're gonna get a version of this
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.920]   that will work with a lot of smart home devices.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.320]   I think what it is gonna drive is innovation
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.920]   further up the stack.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.800]   And I think we're also gonna have to redefine our stacks.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.920]   - Will this help security? - They used to stop.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.000]   - Will this help security?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.800]   Will this make a, 'cause this is,
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.240]   and I'm gonna get, I wanna take a break
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.360]   and then get to this ring story,
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.120]   which I think is the biggest BS story of the year.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.160]   - Oh my gosh, yes.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.200]   - Thank you.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.360]   I feel like there is a concerted effort.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.280]   Some PR, some dark PR company is saying,
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.280]   and I bet you it's finest by Google, let's take down ring.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.080]   - No, 'cause Google had this happen to them.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.480]   We'll talk about it 'cause I wrote about it
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.440]   and I even wrote about a fix.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.680]   - Biggest BS story of the year, it really is.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.240]   And vice, shame on you.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.560]   But okay, we're here. - Oh wait,
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.280]   maybe we're talking about a different BS story.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.440]   - Well, there's two BS stories.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.320]   There's a play story which I think is little more legit.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.320]   That's more new ones. - Okay, I was like,
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.040]   that's legit. - There's the one about
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.120]   Santa Claus talking to the eight year old in a room.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:08.960]   - Oh yes. - Vice just did
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.120]   a big article today on all the security flaws with ring.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.960]   The biggest BS story of the year is pissing me off,
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   but we'll get to that in a moment.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.280]   - I can't wait.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.840]   - Is this gonna help security?
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.920]   - The answer is maybe we don't know
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.000]   what they're gonna put in enforce here.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.320]   So it's hard to say.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.640]   Originally Google's contributing weave to this.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.760]   And originally we've had some security implications
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.200]   or aspirations I should say,
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.480]   where they would say, hey, if you're a refrigerator,
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.320]   you never have any business talking to the front door,
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.280]   which means if the hub saw a refrigerator
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.520]   trying to talk to the front door,
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.640]   it would quarantine it or flag it, right?
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.400]   So it's possible.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.240]   And then I will also say,
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.360]   even if it doesn't have baseline security stuff
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.080]   as part of, I'm gonna say the word again, I'm sorry,
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.280]   everybody drink schema. - Schema.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.280]   - What it will do is it establishes a coherent way
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.760]   things are supposed to work that you can secure too,
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.240]   if that makes sense.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.240]   So now we've basically said, hey, all doorknobs
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.480]   are gonna be this size and look roughly this way.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.120]   So now you can build locks that work for them, right?
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.760]   That was kind of a weird analogy.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.920]   (laughing)
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.160]   - 'Cause that is a problem.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.240]   Certainly now thanks to all these stories
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.080]   about the ring door, the ring cameras,
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.420]   I think on people's minds is, ooh, IOT, insecure.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:35.980]   And that's gotta have to be kind of directly addressed.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.600]   So I would imagine that'll be part of what chip
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.280]   is all about, project chip.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.400]   You know what, maybe I've been around too long, Jeff,
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.720]   but I've seen this, you remember IBM and Apple
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.920]   were gonna do an operating system,
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.800]   a company called Tallegent.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.440]   Remember, I mean, this is a million--
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.600]   - Yeah, we've been around.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.600]   - I was gonna think through the hit parade
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.640]   of standard settings.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.320]   I just, we'll see.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.320]   - One can hope.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.720]   - One can hope. - Yes.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.000]   - 'Cause I can tell you right now,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.360]   if Xtacey, I wanna sit up a time with you at CES
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.840]   so we could spend, Ant and I could spend some time
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.560]   you could show us the IOT stuff.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.740]   I bet you that'll be big,
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.280]   the still the big problem is these guys,
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.680]   you can get that, but you gotta get that
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.520]   'cause Al will work with that,
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.600]   but this won't work with that.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.480]   - I'm curious to hear how those conversations
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.160]   are gonna go in the booth.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.000]   - I, you know, I--
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.880]   - Or if you're getting strong armed into,
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.600]   make sure you only buy this one here
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.520]   and this one here because it's all in the same booth
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.040]   don't buy next door.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.760]   - I'm sitting with about $2,000 with a hue stuff
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.120]   in my Amazon cart.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.480]   (laughing)
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.560]   I'm just waiting 'cause I--
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.600]   - Who's fault is that?
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.440]   - Mine.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.280]   - You're gonna be, so you're gonna be fine
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.200]   with the hue stuff.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.040]   The real question--
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.160]   - Well, I'm all in a hue
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.760]   'cause I got hue, right?
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.600]   - Right, so--
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.120]   - But that gives Phillips a big,
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.000]   or signify a big leg up.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.840]   'Cause I already have the hib.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.960]   - It does, and so in that hub,
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.920]   many people miss this, but back in April,
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.120]   hue, it was back in April, yeah, this last April,
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.680]   hue was like, "Hips everyone, by the way,
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.520]   "your existing version one hub is gonna break next April,
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.640]   "which won't work anymore."
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.800]   And then they also said, as part of that,
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.200]   "and any hub we sell you,
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.040]   "we're only gonna support it, guarantee support,
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.360]   "for the next--"
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.160]   I think it was three to five years,
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.960]   I can't remember if it was three or five.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.160]   And I was like, "What?"
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.400]   That's so short, but that's just the hub,
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.440]   not the gear, although they're making no promises
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.280]   on the gear.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.040]   - Yeah, what if they changed the protocol
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.960]   and now I have to get all new lights?
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.240]   - So if a device in the connected,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.840]   the chip people are not making any promises,
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.360]   they do say that your existing stuff will continue to work.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.040]   They, many devices should be able to work with this.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.600]   They're not saying this officially,
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.600]   they're just saying, "Hey, we've got our new products."
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.440]   - That's what the standard of--
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.280]   - That's what the standard of--
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.440]   - Does Mitz-day see?
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.760]   - Well-- - Oh yeah, that's where
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.960]   is the O's scenario of Samsung saying,
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.840]   "No, you can't do that, then why--"
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.280]   - Well wait, it's-- - It won't work.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.560]   - I know, it's possible.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.600]   So if you have enough computing power,
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.680]   it works over the existing radios,
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.640]   which are the hardships to put in there.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.640]   If you have enough memory and processing power,
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.960]   which you will in hubs, what's gonna happen is,
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.480]   you'll see the hubs likely happen.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.720]   Obviously, this is so new.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.240]   You'll see the hubs be updateable, right?
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.640]   So your echoes and whatnot,
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.280]   because they'd have the processing power and memory.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.960]   And then when you buy new chip compatible devices,
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.440]   those will work with that hub, with your existing hub.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.000]   Your existing gear is still going to,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.920]   like especially in the low end, low power kind of stuff.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.080]   That may not make the transition.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.520]   Some of it might, like thermostats
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.800]   have a lot more computing power than you might imagine.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.080]   So they could theoretically do it.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.920]   Does that make sense?
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.840]   - Yeah, I just, that's what,
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.720]   I think the reason that these companies are doing this
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:10.720]   is because Leo has $2,200 with a few lights in his basket
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.280]   and is willing to push the buy button
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:19.200]   because he doesn't trust that this stuff will all work.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.960]   You know? - That's the key here, I think.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.800]   - Yeah.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:26.000]   - Stacey, one of the numbers on penetration of a smart home.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:26.920]   - Depends on who you ask
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.240]   and it depends on what you're measuring.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.400]   So if you're measuring digital assistants,
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:35.720]   the device that you add into one of control.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.040]   - Okay.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.360]   Talk about something for a minute
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.520]   while I look at the latest data.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.360]   'Cause they don't have the latest.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.840]   - One of the things that seems like everybody's just one
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.520]   in lights to automobiles.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.360]   That's the big thing.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.720]   - The most prevalent smart home device
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.880]   is actually security stuff.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.640]   So security cameras are the number one
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.000]   and those are actually pretty high penetration
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.600]   in terms of sales and because people tend to buy more than one.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.440]   So in households, that's what I don't recall
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.280]   off the top of my head.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.320]   Smart home security systems, like Vinker, home 30%.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.160]   - Yeah.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.720]   - The second most-- - And that would include doorbells
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.600]   as well as cameras indoors and cameras outdoors.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.800]   - Right. - And that makes sense.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.640]   - I have a ton of those.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.640]   That makes a late sense.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.520]   - Lighting is actually like number three
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.160]   behind things like energy efficiency.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.480]   So-- - Oh, interesting.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.400]   - Okay. - Ooh.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.840]   - I would have switched that around.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:29.360]   - Oh, now this is saying, let's see what they're measuring.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:35.280]   IDC says 69% of US households now own
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.440]   at least one smart home device.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.940]   And that does include-- - 30%
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.960]   - IDC data from September.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.600]   That includes AV stuff like speakers
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.040]   and even smart televisions. - Oh, that's so bad.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.480]   - So smart televisions. - So smart TVs, yeah.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.520]   That's a pretty broad broad.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.560]   - You can't buy a dumb TV today.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.520]   - Yeah, no I don't know. - More.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   - So the penetration of speakers is at 26%.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:06.400]   Monitor and security, 17, smart thermostat, 14%,
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.520]   video doorbells, 12%.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.960]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.800]   - Huh.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.600]   - Yeah, I mean, I would love to have,
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.240]   I get why Hue is great.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.960]   I have a motion sensor, I can control them.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.360]   I can, when I go to bed, I say turn off the lights
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.560]   and the whole house goes dark.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.400]   I love that.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.240]   I wanna put them everywhere.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.000]   The big expense here is outdoor.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.120]   We have 11 outdoor lights around the house
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.560]   and I wanna replace those with Hue's.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.440]   'Cause half of them aren't working anyway.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.720]   - That's gonna really add up though.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.160]   - It's 1500 bucks.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.520]   It's a lot of money. - Yeah, they're pricing.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.680]   - For $129 each.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.080]   So it adds up, yes.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.000]   And then I wanna get the sync with the TV.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.840]   - Uh huh.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.440]   - The toy, the Kevin, the Kevin, it's cool.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.320]   - I want the color, so when I'm watching.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.800]   - Oh, the, when I'm watching the ambient lighting.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.640]   - Yeah.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.800]   - I thought you were talking about a kitchen sink.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.640]   I was like, do one too.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.480]   - Yeah, I thought so too.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.320]   - That's why I didn't see.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.880]   I wanna, so we have these lights that go behind your TV.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.400]   And then when you're watching Westworld,
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.560]   it all goes the color of your scenery.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.400]   - And that ambient lighting with these,
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.240]   that'd be pretty cool.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.080]   - It changes too.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:09.920]   - That'll be pretty cool.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.240]   - Kevin had a video, it was pretty cool.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.800]   - He likes it, right?
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.680]   - He does, he still loves it.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.040]   - Do I have to get, I'll get the light,
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.120]   the bar lights, but do I have to get the sink too?
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.720]   How do I get the TV to, I don't see the sink.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.360]   - The sink, you need the sink for the TV.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.480]   Oh, you can't buy the sink on Amazon.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.840]   I have to buy it from us, bye.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.120]   - Oh my God.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:30.960]   Again. - Oh, and change.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.640]   - Standards, standards. - Again.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.000]   - Again.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.840]   - And by the way, it'll be on Amazon.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.640]   - Well, I don't understand why it's not everywhere
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.840]   you buy one of these, it says works with Amazon's Echo.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.080]   I mean, that's part of the sell, also home-kitting home,
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.320]   but that's part of the sell is that you could talk to Echo.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.040]   Actually, I love it that I could choose Google
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.520]   or Amazon to talk to.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.600]   - And now you-- - Yeah.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.080]   - Let's take a break and then I'm gonna talk
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.240]   about the biggest BS story of the year.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.840]   I want-- - Oh, I got a few candidates
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.600]   for that. - Well, I didn't bring my popcorn.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.520]   - But you can, and you guys can talk me down
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.600]   if I'm wrong on this one.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.320]   I just, there's, something doesn't smell right.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.480]   Maybe it's you, I don't know.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.600]   - No, I'm doing it for a shower.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.120]   - That doesn't smell right, just came from the gym.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.800]   I showed it a, brought to you by Metallic.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.160]   I always think, oh, I love Metallica.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.800]   No, not the band. - Not the band.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.640]   - Not the band.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.240]   Metallic from Commvault, it's a Commvault venture,
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.840]   brings you powerful enterprise grade backup and recovery
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   through simple SaaS delivery.

[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.360]   Metallic's unique, it scales across multiple workloads
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.440]   while mitigating the risk of data loss, security threats,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.000]   things like a big one for companies
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.840]   and you wouldn't expect is losing data
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.440]   or losing your access to your data
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.360]   in Microsoft Office 365.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.160]   A lot of companies have a legal requirement
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.200]   to retain emails, documents.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.680]   You don't have the option.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.360]   It also fixes poor backup performance
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.360]   which can slow your whole network down.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.360]   Metallic offers default storage available through Azure,

[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.880]   It could do backup recovery and migration on-prem,
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.880]   it could do it to the cloud.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.240]   There are a number of different products
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.800]   including Metallic core backup and recovery
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.880]   which protects physical drives, virtual servers

[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.200]   for file servers and Windows and Linux,
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.640]   even Microsoft SQL databases.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.080]   If you've got Office and you've got to protect that data,

[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.520]   Metallic.io/twig
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.160]   and we thank Metallic so much
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.320]   for supporting this week in Google.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.240]   I don't know, you know,
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.120]   I've been covering tech for a while
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:13.520]   and there's just something weird in my opinion going on.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.880]   Starting I think with the Vice article,
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.240]   how Ring went from Shark Tank reject
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.000]   to America's scariest surveillance company.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.120]   Boral Panic.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:29.840]   Today we tested Ring security and it's awful.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.200]   This of course with all the news stories everybody saw
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.400]   about the Ring cameras in a poor little eight year old
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:40.200]   Alyssa's bedroom and some jerk posed as Santa Claus,
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.040]   played Tiny Tim, Tiptoe through the tulips
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.960]   and said destroy your room, destroy your room.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:52.200]   So if you read Motherboard's article,
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.120]   and I like Motherboard but I think somebody just got to Vice
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.000]   and said it'd be nice if he could be
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.400]   convenient if you would destroy Amazon right now.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.960]   They basically say, well, here's what's wrong.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.680]   Ring doesn't tell you if you're using a password
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.920]   that's been uncovered in a breach.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:08.760]   - All right.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.200]   - Does anything do that?
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.080]   - Google's Chrome now does but that's about it.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.080]   - No Chrome has a plug in and now they've put it in Chrome.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.440]   - That's the only one.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.440]   - But that is the only one.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.120]   - That's a pretty high bar, Motherboard.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:24.160]   Okay, it doesn't require you use two factor.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.000]   Does anybody?
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.880]   - Well, a lot of things don't.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.200]   - Most things don't.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.640]   So this is, keep going but I'll get to that.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.680]   - I feel like they're setting us a higher standard for Ring
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.680]   now admittedly and that this is what Motherboard
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.640]   should be writing instead of this.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.800]   Listen, if you're gonna use any IoT device,
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.200]   don't reuse a password.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.480]   Here's the half I've been bone database.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.200]   But even then, get a password vault,
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.600]   doesn't have to be our sponsor last class
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.760]   or get a password vault, generate a unique password each time
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.760]   and for crying out loud, turn on too fast.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.720]   - That would be more helpful for readers.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.240]   - I've been saying that, why are we blaming Ring
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.240]   for security practices that are universal?
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   - Right.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.080]   - Yeah.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.280]   And these stories, okay, don't say moral panic
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.840]   'cause I might have to throw something at you
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.760]   'cause this is not really moral panic.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.320]   - Trust me, over our heads.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.400]   - Moral panic, but--
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.240]   - Moral panic.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.240]   - I have a visceral reaction to you shouting moral panic.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.520]   It's like me shouting on my table.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.800]   - I don't think this is moral panic.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.560]   I think this is actually aimed at Ring.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.880]   - I think so.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.120]   It's not just aimed at Ring.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.160]   So in April and then again, later in the year,
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.200]   Nast had the same thing, a bunch of,
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.880]   what this is is, I feel like I blame local news.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.280]   (laughs)
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.120]   What is it?
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.800]   It's very easy to come in and do these scary stories
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.840]   and it has a good visual of sad parents,
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.000]   that they have a visual of their kid,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.200]   get a yelled at, it's scary,
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.680]   and every community has one
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:52.120]   because everybody reuses their passwords
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.640]   and they pick, the hackers are going to pick
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.160]   the most popular devices
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.840]   because it's gonna give you the highest ROI
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.680]   on your investment trying to--
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.520]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.920]   If you can get into somebody's camera, watch them.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.240]   And the best thing about these,
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.680]   like the Nast cameras,
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.280]   they've got microphones as speakers
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.200]   so you can really-- - Exactly.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.720]   - So that's one.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.480]   This is, I hate the reporting on this,
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.800]   I have and have yelled about it for years.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.360]   The other thing, and this is where I wanna
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.440]   take the story forward because this is what I do.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.400]   We actually have hope on the horizon
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.920]   in the form of California's new privacy rules.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.760]   - Yes.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.320]   - SB 327.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.240]   Now we may not have, it doesn't have to go this way,
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.920]   but in that rule, they say two things.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.760]   One, you can't use a default password on devices, great.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.440]   And two, any connected device has to have
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.040]   reasonable security features.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.600]   - Do they define that?
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.040]   - They don't, but they do say,
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.680]   well, they don't define it because they don't wanna say
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.960]   it's one thing when it's, when,
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.240]   they wanted to evolve with the types.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.080]   But what would you say-- - Yeah, but you can't
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.720]   prosecute somebody if they don't say--
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.560]   - Hold it, hold it, hold it.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.880]   - I don't, yes, you can.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.120]   So the AG is gonna make a case.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.880]   So this is how laws work.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.880]   (laughs)
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.840]   This is how this works.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.680]   - Well, AGB.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.320]   - All right, and with reasonable, they're taught,
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.440]   they say that you need to be cognizant
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.880]   of the type of data that the device has access
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:19.880]   to and how the impact of it, basically, if it got out.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:24.200]   So I argue that the California AG could make
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.040]   a really strong case that all devices going forward
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.880]   that involve a camera in the home
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.480]   have to have multi-factor authentication required.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.320]   - I think that's a great idea.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.280]   - Because you may not need it for your light bulbs,
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.560]   but for a camera where you can see what's happening
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.080]   and people can talk to your kids,
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.920]   that feels like it should be required.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.000]   - And you know what-- - But why companies
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.480]   don't do that because it's a grave inconvenience
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.480]   and most-- - People will hate it.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.320]   - People will hate it.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.240]   - Well, it's not your school's fault.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.080]   - Ort.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.600]   - But here's the next step. - A lot of calls
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.760]   to tech support.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.920]   By the way, there's one other thing
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.440]   Motherboard complained about.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.640]   And you've seen this with Gmail.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.600]   If somebody logs into your camera
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.640]   from an IP address you don't normally log into.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.480]   - All right, so you get a note.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.800]   - They're saying rings should let you know.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.440]   Now Google does this, but most things don't--
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.280]   - Most people don't.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.760]   - I've never seen--
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.280]   - Okay, but here comes the next part.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.760]   This is what's great about regulations.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.320]   I know Jeff, we'll talk about this,
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.560]   but it sets a baseline.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.840]   And once we start getting that baseline,
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.640]   companies are gonna be incentivized
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.400]   to make this easier for people.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.800]   - As long as everybody does it.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.880]   - As long as everybody does it,
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.880]   then they're not at a disadvantage.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:33.240]   - So what happens if they do face authentication,
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.800]   which is already on your phone, you're trying to log in.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.240]   So one of the multifactor things can be--
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.080]   - I don't free people out.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:38.920]   - People out.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.720]   - No, you authorize it.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.360]   - You authorize it. - I know, but I know, but I'm just saying
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.840]   in a PR standpoint.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.880]   - No, you authorize it also.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.640]   Well, okay, they could do a fingerprint.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.960]   The point is-- - A lot of,
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.720]   LastPass does this, a lot of my most secure apps now,
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.080]   including the Brave browser, if you want.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.840]   Will, if you've got the biometrics on your phone,
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.480]   we'll give you an option.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.280]   My bank does that too.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.920]   To use Face ID if you're on a Face ID phone or Touch ID
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.600]   if you're on a fingerprint phone.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.000]   I think that's a great feature.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.640]   It's very low, it's easy for consumers
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.520]   because they just hold it up or they touch it,
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.560]   but it gives you much more security.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.400]   It's a great-- - That's easier
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.520]   than the kind of apps where it's in some--
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.920]   - And it's easier than an authenticator.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.760]   So I feel like once we--
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.880]   - But a lot of people don't have these phones, right?
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.560]   What if you don't have that phone?
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.800]   - If you don't have that phone,
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.600]   you're gonna have to go for a password.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.440]   But most of these phones are--
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.280]   - We just talked about how the industry wants to increase
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.960]   the market share out there.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.440]   And then we're now talking about a huge dampening on it
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.560]   by making it more difficult.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.120]   - And I'm not disagreeing with the industry.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.960]   - I think the industry needs to do this together.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.160]   - You know why they're not doing it.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.640]   Yeah, they have to pay everybody's debt.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.280]   - Yes, but the rules will make it so they get to do that
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.200]   because ever once you say everybody has to do this,
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.920]   then they're like, okay, well,
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.760]   they've been incentivized right now
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.680]   for like features like ease of use.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.160]   But once you force people into like security,
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.200]   then you're being forced to make security less painful.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.640]   And we're gonna see cool stuff.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.120]   I promise you, I have faith.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:05.960]   - Yeah.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.680]   - So in a way, Jeff, what you're saying is,
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.120]   is kind of what Stacy's saying.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.720]   She'll get mad at me when you say moral pedic.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.440]   It's what it really is, is this is link bait.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.240]   This is-- - Yeah, bad reporting.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.240]   - This is a great article to write today.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.360]   - But we're doing that. - So everybody's aware of it.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.000]   And we tested Ring Security, it's awful,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.600]   which is actually a completely terrible headline.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.280]   - If they hit post-- - But it's link bait.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.320]   - If they hit post to the story that said,
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.400]   Ring Central has all of these security features
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.320]   that could help you out.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.280]   Let us walk you through setting it up
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.560]   versus putting this actual story down.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.120]   Which one are people gonna click on first?
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:41.960]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.480]   By the way, it's Ring not Ring Central.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.320]   - By the way, not Ring Central.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.160]   - Not Ring Central, sorry. - I'm sorry.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.000]   - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.480]   - A former sponsor Ring. - Sorry.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.640]   - Sorry. - Yeah, I mean,
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.840]   I always turn on two factor,
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.120]   and I certainly try to educate people
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.160]   to turn on two factor.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.280]   And I also try to tell people not to reuse passwords,
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:02.440]   but plenty of people in my family reuse passwords.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.960]   In fact, they also--
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.840]   - I have a-- - You should maybe
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.280]   tone them and be like--
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.600]   - I don't wanna do that.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.280]   - I have a friend that works for a security company
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.600]   back in Carolina, and I asked them about it.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.200]   I said, "Are you all mentioning 2FA?
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.440]   Are you mentioning VPNs and things of that nature
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.200]   to these customers that are buying
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.000]   these security systems around the house?"
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.520]   And they bluntly said, "No, why not?"
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.800]   Because people just don't really care to listen.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.000]   - Yeah. - They just don't--
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.960]   - They just don't care to-- - You give up after real hard sell.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.720]   - Yeah. - They just don't care to listen.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.080]   They are a security conscious company,
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.280]   so of course they have all the signs in the yard,
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.000]   and you know, you wanna protect people from coming in,
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.080]   but we also want to talk to you about securing your network
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.840]   and securing your devices, and they have tried,
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.760]   but people are just-- - Well, I go on the air
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.400]   almost every day, every week on the radio show and say this,
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.720]   but you're right, it's probably going--
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:05.440]   - And we have to internalize that our online lives
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.920]   is worth protecting as much as our physical lives,
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   especially as our physical lives move online thanks to IoT.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.720]   So we're still, like, I think in probably 10 years,
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.000]   people will finally have internalized it enough
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.040]   where they will, and will also have easier things
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.080]   than two factor, or then the current versions of two factor.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.800]   But yes, it is right now people,
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.960]   people who think nothing of like my in-laws,
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.400]   they think nothing of not going upstairs after dark
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.720]   because they're alarm systems on
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.840]   and there's a motion detector,
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.720]   and they're like, everybody stay in your room.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.760]   It's more secure that way.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.800]   But they won't actually do like two factor
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.680]   to access their cameras, right?
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:48.520]   And I'm like,
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:53.840]   - I joked with someone, I said that if I have a conversation
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.840]   and mention VPN to someone,
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.680]   they will look at me as if I talked about
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.120]   using a slow shutter speed.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.160]   - Yeah, you should just,
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.920]   every conversation I have with people like that, basically.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.360]   - Well, the good, okay.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.000]   So I guess it's also what's,
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.200]   that's kind of what makes me mad about this vice piece,
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.480]   just as you said.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.360]   Here's an opportunity,
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.880]   people are suddenly aware thanks to local TV news
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:21.880]   that something's going on.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.880]   Here's a chance to say, well, here's,
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.040]   this isn't a problem with ring per se,
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.760]   it's a problem in general and this is what you need to do.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.560]   And I don't see people doing that.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.720]   - I've done it for years.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.680]   - Yeah, everybody on this panel asks.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.000]   Yeah, no, I know.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.200]   Here's a source of always good reporting,
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.040]   good journalism.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:45.720]   I'm a big fan of Jessica Lesson's, the information.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.000]   And I have to say, Amira Frotti and their team
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.880]   always get the goods.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:55.480]   Here is a scoop that says that Google's brass
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:00.480]   has set as 2023, a deadline to beat Azure and AWS.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:08.040]   They want Google Cloud to be number one in three years.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:08.880]   Doable?
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:12.920]   - I had to know, I saw this headline right under a headline
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:17.000]   that said, "Report sour that Google is cooling on the cloud."
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.880]   - Yeah, well. - Or BS.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.800]   - I trust the information, I'll be honest with it.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.080]   - Yeah, I do. - They got great sources.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.680]   I wonder how you do that.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.520]   You know, I think it's a smart target.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.600]   - Just throw money in it, you got it.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.400]   - It's the kind of thing that it's like a New York Times
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.800]   saying we're gonna hit 10 million subscribers.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.960]   The only Times saying we're gonna hit 300,000 subscribers.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.360]   It's something you try to motivate staff with.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.280]   We're gonna be the biggest.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.760]   If something Steve Ballmer would have said loudly, right?
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.600]   - Right. - Mm-hmm.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.280]   - Yeah, it's your rallying cry to motivate your staff
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.440]   or to demotivate them and be like, "Do this or else?"
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.680]   - There's nothing wrong with this though.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.760]   It's just, cry. - No, it's just motivation.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.640]   - It's an impossible goal 'cause Google is just--
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.480]   - That's right.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.760]   - I'm sorry, dude, we not want me to opine on those clouds.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.080]   - No, that's exactly right.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.280]   It's an impossible goal.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.120]   That's, you said it, that's what I was thinking.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.200]   All right, thank you.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.200]   - But it's also, maybe it's part of the Thomas Curry
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.760]   in era now at Google Cloud.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.800]   I mean, he's from Oracle.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.520]   This is the first time we've really had a hard driving
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:22.520]   enterprise business person bringing Google's cloud ever.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.880]   So maybe, I don't think they'll make it,
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.600]   but they're in a better position to deal with some
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.080]   of their stupid Googly things that bite 'em in the butt
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.800]   when they try to do this.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:36.360]   - Yeah, now that Paige is kind of taking a backseat,
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.120]   Sundar's in charge, here's a time where you wanna say,
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.120]   "Okay, let's get this stuff."
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.320]   - We can get more serious. - Get it organized, if you will.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.760]   - Here is a great command.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:47.480]   I wish Siri and Amazon had this, the Echo had this.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.120]   It's a Google command.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.160]   - Yeah, I didn't know about this.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.760]   - I didn't either. - I didn't either.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.000]   - You didn't either. - Oh, okay, go ahead.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.680]   - It wasn't me. - I tried it out, it works.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.040]   - If you have a Google Assistant and it gets triggered
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.400]   by accident, which happens to me all the time,
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.680]   not just with Google with everybody.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.960]   - Happens to Jason Howe quite regularly.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.120]   - On the show. - Yeah, gorgeous.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.680]   - I sent him this link on the show earlier today.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:10.440]   - But also it happens with Apple's Siri to me an awful lot.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.640]   If you say after this false trigger,
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:17.320]   hey, Goog, that wasn't for you.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.960]   It will stop and delete the last thing you said.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.280]   - Oh, I didn't realize it deleted it.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.440]   That's awesome. - Isn't that cool?
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.920]   - And it's gorgeous. - I saw that first,
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.080]   but I saw it follow the link and I thought, wow.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.400]   - This show is so great.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.320]   I learned all kinds of useful things.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.760]   - That's a great tip.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.240]   - Yeah. - So you're in the throes
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.840]   of love making. - Wait a minute.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.000]   (both laughing)
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.760]   - And something sounds like a spank me, spank me, spank me.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.440]   And Google starts talking, you say,
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:51.480]   Goog, that wasn't for you, it will delete that.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.480]   - Okay, I'm sorry, I do not understand it.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.760]   - I can't even. - It wasn't for anyone.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.600]   (both laughing)
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.720]   - Yeah, I wish I could just, hey,
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.480]   Goog, delete those last few memories.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.600]   - No, I wish you could not have your own mind.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.240]   - Hey, Leo, that wasn't for me, delete.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.120]   - That wasn't for anyone.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.440]   - All right, anyone.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.640]   - Is that a bad image?
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.960]   Facebook says it is going to comply with CCPA.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.680]   CCPA is going to end up being a very interesting.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.480]   It goes in effect January 1st.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:23.800]   - What different is it from GDPR?
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.760]   - Facebook says it. - If you're already
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:28.400]   complying with GDPR, are you ready for CCPA?
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.240]   - No.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.400]   (both laughing)
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.560]   - That's a good answer. - A different answer.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.320]   - The short answer is no.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.320]   - Let me look it up.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:39.040]   I want to actually look up the essentials of CCPA.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.040]   - Yeah, I don't know all the details.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:40.960]   - Yeah. - I love it.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:41.880]   - And by the way, before-- - What did we know
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.320]   article from two weeks ago?
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.600]   - Before we-- - Gosh.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:49.480]   - Before we pat California Assembly on the back,
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.680]   there's also AB5.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.000]   I don't know if you saw this, Jeff,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.600]   but SB Nation has started firing California freelancers
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:00.600]   because, hey, sorry, but AB5 prevents us from hiring you.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.560]   - It's the gig economy. - Yeah, I lost a lot of money.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.720]   - For my journals, I lost a lot of money.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.560]   - It's hell.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:06.400]   - It's hell.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.160]   - Ant was going to be at CES, not for us,
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.440]   but for, can I say this?
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.520]   - Tech Republic. - Oh.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.520]   - Tech Republic.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.120]   - Plus a lot of money.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.480]   - Wow, ants.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.320]   - Look at this. - Sorry.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.840]   - Vox Media to cut, and so Tech Republic, same thing,
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.240]   'cause you're in California now.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:22.200]   Vox Media to cut hundreds of freelance jobs
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.720]   because of AB5.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:27.440]   - And to Tech Republic's credit,
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:29.880]   they did not want it to go down this way.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.200]   - They didn't think Tech Republic
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.760]   clearly wanted me to cut on this.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.680]   - But we even have, we've gone to RHR,
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.240]   we use ADP for HR, we've gone to them saying,
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.880]   'cause the laws are constant, California is tough.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:41.720]   - Right.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.200]   - They're jobists to keep track of all this stuff
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:48.040]   and advise us on what we can and cannot do.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:53.040]   My son wanted to be kind of a freelance employee of Twit,
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.280]   and we said, you can't.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.120]   - All right.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.000]   - He's a full-time salesperson now, but he wants to--
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.120]   - This, I mean, the impact on journalism,
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:06.040]   just to pick one of many, many fields
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:10.320]   that use gig economy stuff is horrendous.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.160]   - Yeah.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:14.760]   Yes, it would be nice if we went back to the days
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.920]   and we all had worked for the same company
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.000]   and the company was good to us for 40 years,
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.040]   but we are not in that economy.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.640]   And it's making an openness and it's demonized
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.520]   a structure of work.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.080]   We're looking at the journalism school,
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.480]   we have to prepare students more and more
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.880]   for being independent, resilient journalists
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:36.040]   who are gonna make money through freelance,
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.760]   through YouTube, through medium, through Kickstarter,
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:42.960]   through Patreon, through books, through all kinds of stuff.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.320]   They're gonna have to cag together a living
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.800]   to support what they do.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.600]   And this cuts off a huge piece of that
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:50.600]   and might make it impossible.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.880]   - I look at this from both perspectives
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:57.880]   because one of my former employers is a PEO.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.240]   So I was able to see a lot of the--
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.720]   - What's a PEO?
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.880]   - Professional employer organization,
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.800]   which handles small to medium-sized businesses
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.920]   administration for ourselves.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.160]   - Oh, I see, so you're actually employed by them,
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.240]   not by the company you work for.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.480]   - Oh, China, that's how I do my business.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.760]   - China, Microsoft, I try to--
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.560]   - Microsoft does this with a lot of its employees
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.800]   and working for a third party.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:19.640]   - Really?
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:20.480]   - Yeah.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.480]   - And so-- - You have a big Microsoft?
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.160]   - Yeah, a lot of companies do.
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:26.400]   - When I look at it from both perspectives
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:30.520]   as the business owner and also as the IC
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:34.360]   independent contractor, I get where the business owner
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.480]   is trying to cut their costs because they have to pay
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.680]   at FICA food, a suitor and all of that.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.040]   - All the benefits.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.440]   - That's a ton of money.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:45.240]   - That's like 25% of what we pay you.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.200]   An additional 25% is gonna be benefits or more.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.040]   - Yeah.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.240]   - And it's a lot of money, but then on the other side,
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.760]   you have that independent contractor that was saying,
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.440]   "Man, I really need those benefits.
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.520]   They should have me as a W-2 in the floor."
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.920]   - Well, I think that was the intent of this
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.440]   is for Uber and Lyft drivers most of it, right?
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.520]   - So I see it both ways, but my point of view is,
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:07.720]   man, I really like being able to just say,
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.720]   "Hey, I'd like to write for Tech Republic.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.000]   I'd like to write for ZDNet.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.720]   I'd like to write for whomever,
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.440]   because I'm a gun for hire, if you will."
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:15.280]   - Right.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.720]   - And you were making a living doing it.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.560]   - And I was making a nice wage.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.040]   - The problem is that Tech Republic doesn't want to employ
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.720]   you as a freelancer, 'cause you're now living in California.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.920]   - There's like, "Man, we gotta make you a W-2 employee."
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.720]   And I'm like, "No, I don't want to do that."
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.920]   I'd said that.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.840]   - Oh, so that's interesting.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.400]   So they would have continued to employ you as an employee.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.040]   - So where a lot of people are losing their jobs
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.600]   is companies like Vox don't want to do that.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.400]   - That's most, that's most, yeah.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.240]   That's why I said a Give Tech Republic credit,
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.360]   because that's interesting.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.200]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.280]   - They wanted to work this out.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.040]   - It's just that you didn't want to be here.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.440]   - I didn't want to be here.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:49.520]   - Right, I'm here.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.280]   - You've already got a W-2 job.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.600]   - Right, right.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.360]   - And so what happens is a lot of money,
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:57.960]   so at my school, because they're so scared generally
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:02.040]   with the IRS about trying to get around employment stuff,
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.520]   we can hire somebody to write a piece for us,
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.800]   and we get required to put them on the payroll.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.560]   And what that means is we've got to pay 30, 40%
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.840]   of whatever we pay them to benefits they'll never get.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.680]   - That's correct.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.160]   - FICA-FUDA-SUDA.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.720]   FICA-FUDA-SUDA.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.560]   What it could have turned out.
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.560]   - I've never heard it sound like that.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.200]   I'm like, "FICA." - FICA.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.120]   - FICA. - I know what they are.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.120]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:21.960]   - Now I got it. - Now I got it.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:23.560]   - Security, what's FUDA and SUDA?
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.320]   - Those are the state unemployment and federal unemployment.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:27.640]   - Okay.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.800]   - So that's the bad.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:29.600]   Here's the good.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.080]   This is AB 375.
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:37.320]   The California, CCPA, the California, what is that?
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.560]   Consumer Privacy Act.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.600]   These are, according to Wikipedia,
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:44.480]   the intentions of the act to provide California residents.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:45.840]   This is somewhat like GDPR,
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.720]   to know what personal data is being collected about them.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.040]   Know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed,
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.000]   and to whom?
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.960]   By the way, those are the first two points I've always said.
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:01.200]   These companies need to be very clear about this.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.680]   - And those are both in GDPR.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.520]   - Yep.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:08.400]   You need to be able to say no to the sale of your personal data.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.240]   Now what they don't say--
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.200]   - Oh, the fine sale is the problem, right?
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.120]   - Yeah, but what they don't say is if you say no,
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.080]   do you continue to have the benefit or service?
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.040]   And I think it's also reasonable for the company to say,
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.280]   "Well, sorry, but that's how we monitor this."
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.320]   So you can't have Gmail or whatever.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.560]   - GDPR actually says that you can't denigrate the service
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.600]   quality if someone says no.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.440]   - Ah, that's different.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.880]   Yeah, I think that's not recognizing
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.360]   the exigencies of business.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.440]   If I can't monetize you, I'm not gonna--
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.960]   - This is Europe versus the US.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.800]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.120]   - Point four.
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.400]   Point four.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.080]   And this is a GDPR point as well.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.960]   Residents need to be able to access their personal data.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.840]   I presume that means access the data
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.640]   the company has about you.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.440]   - GDPR also allows you,
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.320]   if they allow you to access and have a process
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.760]   for correcting it.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:03.040]   - And that also point five, request a business to delete
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.160]   any personal information about a consumer collected
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.400]   from that consumer, that's GDPR.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.840]   - Which is kind of ridiculous in a sense,
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.720]   in the sense of can you tell Amazon to delete
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.280]   all the things you bought from Amazon?
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.120]   - It's a hardship.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.200]   - Amazon has a legitimate business reason to have it.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.160]   - Right, it's a hardship for companies because yeah.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.200]   And finally, and this is one that's a little bit like
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.640]   what you were saying, Stacey.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.400]   California residents cannot be discriminated against
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.160]   for exercising their privacy rights.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.720]   Does that mean you have to--
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.040]   - No, it actually, so this is really interesting
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.840]   because this reminds me, I don't know if you remember,
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.560]   AT&T used to say, "Hey, we'll charge you less
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.880]   "if we can monetize your data."
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.800]   And we'll give you a gigabit service.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.160]   They're saying you can't do something like this.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.360]   You can't, basically you can't turn privacy into a luxury.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.720]   - Interesting, good.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.040]   - Which I think is, I mean, that's very pro-consumer
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.240]   in really weird that it made it in there.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.520]   And that is not in GDPR.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.480]   - I cannot disagree with any of those six points.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.400]   It applies only to businesses with gross revenues,
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.000]   annual gross revenues in excess of 25 million.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.520]   Or, and they, or these are any one of these three,
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.880]   buys or sells the personal information of 50,000
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.920]   or more consumers or households.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.400]   I presume that's California consumers, but I don't know.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.400]   - It is. - Yeah.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.280]   - Earns more than half its annual revenue.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.640]   - How do you know?
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.840]   - Well, probably it's in the law.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.200]   I'm just reading a summary by Wikipedia.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.320]   Earns more than half of its annual revenue
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.520]   from selling consumers personal information.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.960]   Well, you mean, how would the consumer know that?
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.800]   - No, how is the company?
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.960]   - No.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.520]   - If the consumers are in California?
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.360]   - Yeah.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.520]   - They don't, that's what makes this law so interesting.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.960]   (laughs)
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.800]   - Well, and that's why Facebook is saying,
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.200]   we're not gonna change our web tracking
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:56.240]   in response to this law because we're already compliant.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.880]   - In me? - Really?
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.160]   - The Attorney General just last, was it last week?
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.240]   I think it was last week.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.520]   They had one of their last information sessions
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.240]   where the California Attorney General's
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.200]   having these information sessions
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.200]   where people are welcome to come talk to them
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.520]   about enforcements.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.560]   So it's important to say that nobody knows
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.800]   how exactly California plans to--
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.960]   - Just like GDPR.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.240]   We were waiting for the other shoe to drop.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.240]   And we don't, GDPR created these data authorities.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.960]   This doesn't do anything like that.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.440]   So like, if I were a consumer,
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.320]   I would file a complaint with my local data authority.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.320]   Here, I don't know if I file a complaint with the company,
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.080]   if I just call the AG's office.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.840]   So it's unclear how like this is gonna,
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.720]   like how a California can be like,
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.440]   "I wanna see my data and I want it all deleted."
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:52.360]   - Well, so Facebook is saying,
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.520]   "Well, we don't sell the data."
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:58.200]   So we're exempt. - All right.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.320]   - Well, they don't sell the data.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.720]   They sell ads against the data.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.560]   - Yeah.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.040]   - So maybe that's a loophole.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.320]   The law needs to go in this.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.920]   - No, it's no, we go back to bad reporting
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.360]   over all the years, is that they've always been portrayed
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.160]   as selling the data and they never have.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.160]   - That's their secret sauce.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.080]   - And neither does it.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.360]   I mean, actually, Time Inc would sell the data on you.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.280]   AT&T sells the data.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.120]   - Yeah.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.880]   - But people who sell advertising like Google and Facebook
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.960]   keep the data and use it to sell ads.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.240]   'Cause that's valuable.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.360]   They're not gonna give that or sell that.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.840]   That's Facebook.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.840]   So also, starting January 1st, get ready
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:41.680]   because websites will have to start putting a button
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.640]   on the front page saying,
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.080]   "Don't collect my data.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.320]   "Do not sell my personal information."
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.640]   - Is this the same thing as the,
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.160]   we now accept cookies.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.360]   So you must click here,
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.200]   do you know that we--
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.040]   - I don't know.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.200]   I mean, this sounds more dramatic.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.840]   It says, "You may not sell my personal information.
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:02.400]   "If a consumer clicks that button,
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.800]   "according to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.280]   "the site is barred from any transaction
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.520]   "that sends data to third parties."
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.360]   And selling--
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.320]   - That's just, that's just,
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.880]   so what that's gonna,
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.800]   that also could have a huge impact on the LA Times.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.720]   - Mm.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.640]   - Because it's programmatic advertising.
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:20.480]   Right?
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.320]   Well, how is that gonna be interpreted?
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:25.240]   - But does it send data out about users?
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.640]   Or-- - Yeah, it says yes.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:30.800]   When you go to a programmatic trading floor,
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.200]   you say, "I got somebody who likes shoes."
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.080]   And the trading floor says, "Okay, I'll pay you this for 'em.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.040]   "Okay, they're yours."
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.080]   - Right.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.440]   - That's an exchange of data.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.600]   Who knows how this interpreted?
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.680]   In GDPR, your IP address is considered
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.480]   personally identifiable information.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.080]   That's how-- - That's nuts.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.080]   - Ignorant, the lawmakers.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.680]   - That's ignorant, because of course,
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.080]   it's public information.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:54.920]   - Right.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:55.760]   - And-- - And it's--
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.600]   - Necessary information.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.440]   - Right.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.520]   Yes, by the way.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.400]   Facebook has told advertisers,
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.080]   its tracker's data collection
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:05.360]   doesn't constitute selling under California law,
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.760]   so it doesn't have to put that button on.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.920]   Facebook maintains publishers
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.840]   who can adjust settings to block its web tracker
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.920]   called Pixel from transmitting the data of users
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.200]   who have opted out, because of course,
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.760]   a lot of publishers live on Facebook
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.240]   and they would then have to somehow do the same thing.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.960]   Businesses already have the ability to manage
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.840]   whether they send data and how they send data
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.280]   to Facebook through Pixel.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:36.280]   Okay, so I get the attorney's general's office
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.840]   has declined to discuss enforcement
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.520]   regarding particular companies, so--
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.360]   - I presume-- - I presume--
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.080]   - These are gonna be, well--
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.240]   - You gotta think Facebook's counsel
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.520]   has had some conversations.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.400]   - Already, I would expect.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.640]   I mean-- - Yeah.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.920]   - But I guess it doesn't make sense though,
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:59.360]   if Facebook is just presenting a data set
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.160]   and not actual individualized data points to advertisers,
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.000]   like I said, that's the thing.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.840]   - Well that's the thing, yeah, I mean--
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.080]   - They're just sending over pie charts.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:09.920]   - We just have to wait--
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.680]   - We have to wait for the impressions today from this--
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.560]   - Right, is that selling data?
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.840]   - 20 to 40 year olds, you know.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.440]   - Jeff, you said you sounded like you thought
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.480]   that was selling data.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.560]   - Well, I, no, I mean--
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.920]   - Is that what the time-- - Is selling data under the law?
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.440]   Is it really selling data to do targeted advertising?
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.840]   No, I don't think so.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.160]   - Will the law consider it?
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.280]   - Well, that's a good chance. - Well, that's a good chance.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.360]   - Yeah.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.200]   - Fair enough.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:37.600]   - Danger danger.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.320]   - Are you involved in this oversight board?
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.680]   - No, I have been at full disclosure time.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.600]   We raised money from my school from Facebook.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.280]   I received no compensation from Facebook
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.600]   or any platform personally and independent of them
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.840]   and full disclosure.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.560]   I got invited to, with many, many, many people,
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.440]   they did huge sessions with other people
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.560]   to input sessions about the oversight board.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.480]   And I know the people who put it together
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.360]   and it's, I've got to say,
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.840]   I'm very impressed with the structure.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.840]   I've written about this at some length,
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.520]   saying that I think they've got to go another step
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.760]   in terms of having a North Star
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.200]   for why the company exists
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.960]   and what the oversight board is going to tie.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.560]   It's oversight too.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.520]   But in terms of thinking through the independence,
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.160]   the organization, the operations,
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.760]   they've done an amazing job.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.880]   And most every credit that come against
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.040]   does give them that cred
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.800]   that they've really done a good job of this.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.320]   Proof will be in the pudding.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.160]   We shall see.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.200]   They haven't named,
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.400]   they've got to name two important groups.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.480]   They've got to name not only the oversight board members,
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:43.280]   which will amount to about 40.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.520]   They're going to name the first 10 to 20.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.200]   And then that board is going to recreate itself
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.400]   and name the rest from that on out.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:55.400]   But they're also naming a trust.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.360]   So the trust got $130 million from Facebook
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.480]   to fund the work of the oversight board henceforth.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.240]   So Facebook will not be writing any checks
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.720]   for the oversight board or anybody on it.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.560]   They'll be paying them.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.480]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.320]   That's out of the trust. - That's out of the trust.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:09.880]   - And the trust is set up.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.520]   This is why they really thought this through.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.640]   I mean, think about Facebook.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.320]   When you get down a couple of levels,
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.840]   you pretty inevitably deal with really smart people
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.320]   who are trying.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:21.920]   They get frustrated by some things their company does,
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.400]   but they're really pretty amazing at that level.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.960]   And so the trust is set up
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.880]   such that it is an independent body
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:33.040]   and it could accommodate other companies
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.360]   wanting to do the same thing.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.440]   If Reddit came along and said,
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.240]   we want to have an oversight board,
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.640]   then Facebook has already set up
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.600]   an independent legal structure that could do it for them.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.680]   So it is a separate entity.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.080]   And then there are bylaws within that that say,
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:49.920]   now this operates.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.240]   Now the bylaws say that once the oversight board
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.120]   makes a decision,
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.360]   no one including Mark Zuckerberg can overrule him.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.160]   So I'm fascinated.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.160]   Could Facebook say take down that Donald Trump ad?
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.360]   At first they're not going to do ads,
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.960]   but it is going to expand to that.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:11.400]   The bylaws also say that Facebook can't fire anybody.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.920]   The trust can fire somebody.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.320]   And there's a set of cause for that.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.000]   And so it's a really interesting experiment
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.160]   in a form of internet governance.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.560]   And it's kind of in local regulator.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.560]   Good.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.560]   And 130 million is not an insignificant amount.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.560]   It's new.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.560]   And they already spent tens of millions
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.560]   on this process of study and outreach.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.560]   We don't know anybody of the first 11 on the board, do we?
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.560]   Is that a statement?
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.560]   No, we don't.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.560]   Anybody been named? No.
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:46.560]   No, it's been named publicly yet.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.560]   No, we have the trust.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.560]   He's been named.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.560]   The A, an accountancy firm or a trading company,
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.560]   I'm forgetting VBM, not a BBM, not a silver one.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:01.560]   Is acting as the trustee as a corporate entity right now
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:05.560]   hired until the trust is in place.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.560]   I had lunch with two people who were doing all this work just the other day.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.560]   So I was hearing the latest.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.560]   Again, people I like, people I respect.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:17.560]   Once the trust gets going next year, they're going after other tasks at the company.
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:21.560]   They were there to set it up and to get the input of academics.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:22.560]   One prayer, if you're really interested in this,
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.560]   the person I would follow was a woman named Kate Klonik,
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:29.560]   who was a law professor at St. John's in New York.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:33.560]   She has been independently embedded in this process.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.560]   And she's writing about it for the New Yorker.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.560]   She's going to write about it elsewhere.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.560]   She's, she, they gave her access to the entire process.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:44.560]   Oh, let's see.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:49.560]   What else? What other stories?
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.560]   Stacy is seeing anything you really want to talk about.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.560]   I'm just looking through here.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.560]   I feel I've been overwhelmed by the things we've already talked about.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.560]   Yes, I was giving you a chance to recoup all of the apps.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.560]   You had major work at the beginning of the show.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.560]   Stacy, really all the heavy listening.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.560]   You have for a major day.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.560]   All the apps?
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.560]   Well, I'm sad.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.560]   I'm sad that I'm on top of everything else.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.560]   You know, so Trump has a trade deal coming along with China,
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.560]   which, you know, by the way came in the nick of time,
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.560]   saving Apple a considerable amount of money.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.560]   The three days before the Sunday, those tariffs are supposed to go
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.560]   into effect, 15% tariffs.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.560]   That would have been a significant amount of money on Apple products,
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.560]   including the iPhone.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.560]   But we just found out the USA USDA has taken Wakanda off as a free trade partner.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.560]   Wakanda was on the list.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.560]   Wakanda was on the list.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.560]   It's one of those, I put them on the list because it's kind of those geeky moments
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.560]   where they're testing out the software.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.560]   They're putting it in countries to see how it works.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.560]   And they included somebody included Wakanda.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.560]   Wakanda!
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.560]   That's awesome.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:52.560]   Isn't it?
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.560]   It is awesome.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.560]   They're all doing the Wakanda.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.560]   Wow.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.560]   That's of course the mythical--
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.560]   We no longer have a free trade deal.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.560]   The mythical land in the Black Panther collect-in movie.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.560]   No vibranium.
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:10.560]   [laughter]
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.560]   New Orleans hit by--
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.560]   A short vibranium.
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.560]   New Orleans hit-- we don't know by what?
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:19.560]   By some sort of cyber attack.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.560]   It's kind of a-- I shouldn't make it.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.560]   I shouldn't laugh.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:31.560]   But on Friday, about 11 a.m. in City Hall in the Orleans, the PA system came alive and said,
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.560]   "Turn off your computer, unplug it and step away."
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.560]   They were so worried.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:41.560]   Apparently they were under attack, spearfishing attack.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.560]   It's unclear whether they got hit by ransomware or not.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:51.560]   Although I did see a story that said that there were fingerprints of Riek.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:56.560]   The Riek ransomware virus is very, very popular these days.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:04.560]   Eminating, they were being submitted to VirusTotal, which is, I think it's Google's Virus repository.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560]   It doesn't mean they were infected.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.560]   It got bit by ransomware.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.560]   It means they were getting Riek sent to City Hall.
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:18.560]   It looks like City Hall sort of continued on.
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.560]   Officials said crucial public safety services were up and running, but City Hall offices
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.560]   will fall back onto pen and paper.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.560]   But again, that might just be because they turned the system off.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.560]   They're like, "Ah!
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.560]   It might be a timer.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560]   What's happening?
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560]   Turn it off."
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.560]   You know what?
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.560]   That's my daughter's response.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.560]   That's actually what we trained her to do when she was young.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560]   Good.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.560]   Do you see weird stuff on your computer?
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.560]   Run and just stop what you're doing and get us.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.560]   I would say unplug it right away.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.560]   Anyway, that's what they did.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.560]   They said, "This is what our federal law enforcement told us.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:54.560]   Our federal and state partners said, 'That's what we should do.'
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.560]   And that's the way we've been trained to respond.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.560]   So we just unplugged."
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.560]   Shout out to them for that.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560]   That's awesome.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.560]   They might have saved, they actually might have saved something.
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.560]   You know, there's been dead silence ever since, but as far as I can tell, they've been able
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.560]   to run as normally this week.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.560]   You remember how petty?
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.560]   Oh, oh.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.560]   I mean, not just bred.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560]   I mean, my goodness.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.560]   They saved themselves from something like that.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.560]   Absolutely.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.560]   Absolutely.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.560]   So I've got a fun story here.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.560]   Yes.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:32.560]   So Greta Tundberg was on a train, finally going home, going to her slow boat to Sweden.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.560]   And she was on a German train.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.560]   And then she posted a picture just saying, "Finally on the way home."
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.560]   She's sitting on the floor of the ICE train going through Germany.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.560]   And that's all it was, right?
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.560]   So then finally she's...
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560]   Finally, she's picture.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.560]   She's looking at the window.
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:48.560]   Oh, it's real.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.560]   The Chinese food there.
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:50.560]   It's great.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.560]   She's just the most amazing.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:56.560]   So then the German rail company posted...
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.560]   Well, you were in first class.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.560]   I hope they took care of you.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.560]   Well, they first they apologized.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.560]   First they apologized.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.560]   But then they deleted the tweet.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:12.880]   And first they tweeted, "Dear Greta, thank you for supporting us railroaters in the fight
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.880]   against climate change.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.400]   We're happy that you traveled with us on Saturday.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:21.560]   But it would have been nice or had you reported how friendly and competently you were looked
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:26.920]   after by our team at your seat in first class."
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.080]   So then she came back and she said, "I wasn't complaining about anything."
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.080]   And she didn't.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.080]   She was absolutely right.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.080]   Oh, she said in fact...
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:37.640]   And one of my trains, two of my trains got rerouted and there weren't any seats on those
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.960]   two trains and then I did get a seat and I didn't say anything.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:45.400]   So then it's just the perfect German story now, the perfect German story.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:51.680]   So now the privacy regulator is looking into this to go after the train company from
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.240]   the building that she was in first class.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.240]   Oh, no.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.240]   Oh, no.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.240]   That's fantastic.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.240]   That's just perfect.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.240]   The Germans.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.240]   The Germans.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:02.240]   Oh.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.240]   Oh.
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.240]   Nice transition there.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.240]   That was nice.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.800]   I enjoyed this flag.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.240]   Oh, get ready.
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.320]   Now the Kevin's on the board.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.600]   Anything can happen.
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:19.000]   Fellow passengers also, by the way, violating German's privacy laws, said she had been accompanied
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.040]   by her father and that the Deutsche Bahn staff had given her little slabs of chocolate with
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:30.560]   the word libslingost, which means favored guests, which are normally given to passengers
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:34.480]   in first class as well as second class passengers in the event of long delays.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.960]   She's a Liebling guest.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:36.960]   I want to entertain.
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.600]   There was also a journalist along and so the journalist confirmed her.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:46.680]   By the way, last week, this is really minor, but last D site, which is which is phenomenal.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:52.480]   The smartest publication in Germany and really innovative, really great.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.000]   They had one of their staffers take off their Twitter, take over the Twitter feed last week
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   and he was hilarious.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.080]   He was talking about the Germans.
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:03.080]   The Germans are arguing about sugar.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.080]   They always argue about sugar.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.920]   Now the Germans are finished arguing about sugar and they're getting along again.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:09.920]   I want to say.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:10.920]   I want to inject.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:11.920]   There was a little hand there.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.920]   I don't know what was going on.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:13.920]   Was that that creepy?
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:18.240]   Y'all answers trying to interject.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:23.560]   I think it was my second episode of Hands on Photography.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:29.120]   I ended the show by saying it's not about the megapixels, it's about the story.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:34.920]   When you look at this image right here, what story is this image telling?
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.800]   Sorry, I pulled it up here.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.600]   I had the picture.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.680]   So that's why it came off.
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.880]   That's why they reacted to her and said, "Hey, you were in first class.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.720]   That picture is telling a whole different story."
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:52.480]   Well, but then she responded, "No, I wasn't in first class the whole time."
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.880]   This goes back and forth.
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:58.680]   She'd only been able to sit in a seat after Gottenkin more than four hours into her journey.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:18:59.680]   Good.
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.680]   Good.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:01.680]   Good.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:02.680]   Good.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.720]   After and for two hours before having to change in Hamburg for a further connection towards
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:05.720]   Scandinavia.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.120]   So she did have to sit on the floor for four hours.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.600]   But she said, "That's not a bad thing.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.600]   It's a good thing.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.600]   People are using it."
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.600]   Yeah, she was glad the trains were being used.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.600]   She was fine.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.400]   She wasn't complaining.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.880]   The old white man lose to her every time, every time.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.240]   She is pretty good, isn't she?
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.240]   Oh, she's just great.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.600]   Don't mess with a tonne-berg.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.680]   Donne mess with a...
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:35.160]   Edward Snowden has been told, "You can't make money on permanent record," his new book,
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:38.520]   because the NSA and the CIA didn't clear it.
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.680]   A federal judge in Virginia ruled yesterday that Snowden should have gone...
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:44.040]   Oh, yeah, this will work.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.040]   Yeah, I'm...
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:51.960]   The first one of the CIA and NSA had asked for permission before he wrote the book.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.960]   He was a previous employee.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.920]   Do you see whether the advance went to them already or not?
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.800]   Because the advance is where you make your money.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.800]   Right.
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.200]   Well, this is a different thing.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.160]   I bet he sold a lot of copies of this book.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:08.720]   So he argued that I didn't put anything in there that wasn't already public.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:09.720]   And I don't want to see...
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.720]   Thanks to me.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:15.760]   And I don't want the CIA to edit my life.
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:16.760]   So...
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.480]   So do they do...
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.480]   Do they do like a lean against his earnings?
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.480]   Do they garnish his earnings?
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.480]   He's in Russia.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.480]   What are they going to do?
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.480]   Yes.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.680]   Well, they go to the publisher and so up till the publisher you can't pay him.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.680]   That's right.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.680]   Okay, so they do.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.680]   They garnish his earnings.
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:31.680]   They garnish his earnings.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:37.920]   And that is a long-standing policy, not just for security officials, but you know...
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:38.920]   Tax evasion.
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.680]   That's why you got to put your money in the forend.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:44.320]   It's in account before he piss off the government.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:47.160]   That sounds like the voice of experience there, Stacey.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:54.400]   But have you never planned to, like, not pay your taxes?
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.880]   I just got my bill from the IRS.
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:56.880]   Oh, I know.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:57.880]   I'm so impressed.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.440]   So I'm like, "Oh, I'm so sorry."
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.400]   See, that's the freelancer's curse.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:06.640]   That's why AB5, they want you to be in the system so that you have to give them money
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:07.640]   all the time.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.600]   You know, I'm okay.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:14.600]   It's the curse, but we have great sponsors like FreshBooks to keep us squared away.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:15.600]   That's right.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.600]   That's right.
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.360]   Is that who we're doing next?
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.360]   No.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:22.040]   Oh, I was like, "Wow, what is happening?"
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.040]   He was a good segue.
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.520]   It's too bad.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.520]   Wasted.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.520]   Wasted.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.240]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.240]   Well, let's see.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:31.760]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.880]   I was like, "I'm sorry, you guys.
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.800]   I have very little to contribute."
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.960]   Yeah, let's do the change log.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.960]   Ooh.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   It's a test.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   It's a test.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:42.960]   Oh, that was good.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.960]   That was good.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:44.960]   Oh, that was good.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   That was fast.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.960]   That was several milliseconds.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:48.960]   Oh, that was.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.960]   That was latency.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.840]   Google had a little problem with Chrome 79.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:58.080]   We talked about it rolling out last week, and apparently there's a bug on Android that
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.480]   wipes data out in some apps.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.240]   It's a complicated bug having to do with Android's built-in WebView.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:13.680]   A lot of apps use WebView to display Web content within the app, and apparently changes
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:18.440]   about where the location was stored.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:25.720]   That was updated, and so moved data from local storage in WSQL, and it wasn't migrated
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.520]   properly in some cases.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:31.840]   So, Google has just paused 79 for Android.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.040]   Not clear which apps got hurt.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.040]   Just something you should be aware of.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.840]   That's the opposite of a change log.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.360]   It's not going to happen long.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.160]   Google Maps is a nice feature for Stacey.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.880]   She drives an electric vehicle.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:50.880]   You can now search within Maps for Electric Car charging stations by plug-type.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:55.880]   We're talking about the tower of Babel with electric plug sockets.
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.160]   I don't know if you can say, "Let's see."
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:00.120]   Yeah, they do have Tesla.
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:06.520]   Tesla, Chathamo, CCS, Type 2, CCS, Combo 1 and 2, J1772.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:12.440]   Choose your plug, and then you'll be able to find compatible charging stations.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:15.000]   That was what we were talking about just minutes ago.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.840]   Oh, is that a visual thing?
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.680]   Because I know what the other...
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:22.240]   Because your Tesla usually comes with at least two adapters, and I'm trying to figure
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.240]   out how...
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.240]   So they have pictures of the plugs.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.240]   Ah, okay.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.240]   Good.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:27.600]   So you recognize that one, but you're right.
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.600]   The third Tesla has everything.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.680]   J1772 and one other Type 2.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.320]   Chathamo is the next... is most common.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.320]   Could you...
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.600]   So explain this to me, advanced people.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:44.160]   How many different charging stations out there and can you get a plug for every one
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.160]   of them or no?
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.160]   Tesla comes with adapters.
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.160]   Right.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.040]   Can you do that for every one of them or there's something you can't use?
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.360]   There's some you won't be able to use.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.280]   Like, see the CCS charger, there's a fast charging option, which you won't be able to
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280]   use.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.920]   And then what if I'm a non...
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.080]   What if I'm a...
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.080]   I have a non-Tesla...
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:04.480]   Can I use a Tesla one?
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.480]   No.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:06.480]   No.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.960]   Tesla does not let anyone who is not Tesla.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.680]   That's restraint of trade or something.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:10.680]   No.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:11.680]   They built them.
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.680]   It's their things.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.680]   Well, there's also...
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:19.640]   I don't know how much of this is real or not, but there's voltage considerations and
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.600]   step downs that you have to do.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.200]   They could fry your vehicle.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:29.760]   They don't... like the superchargers, those go, they go.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.760]   They really hum.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.720]   So I don't know if a volt could take that kind of power.
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:39.200]   Actually, the volts made to use CCS fast charging, but it's a different plug.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.200]   So...
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.200]   Well, yeah.
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.200]   And this is exactly what I was talking about with the gasoline...
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.360]   Ollitus sounds German to me.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:51.160]   But I think it's all going away because as part of their settlement, Audi, VW, remember
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:58.800]   they got diesel gate, they have been required to build $1 billion worth of charging stations
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.800]   in the US.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:04.240]   It's something called Electrify America and they'll all be CCS fast chargers.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.240]   So that's the new...
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:06.680]   I think that's the coming standard.
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:09.440]   Obviously, Elon's always going to go with his, but the coming standard...
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.240]   So you're in USB 3 and Elon will be laying...
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.240]   Exactly.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.720]   So, but that's...
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.640]   Yeah, it is kind of like that actually, isn't it?
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:24.120]   There is a new button on Nest Hubs.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.160]   They're going to get a home button.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.160]   I like my...
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:34.080]   In fact, I have my Nest home max here because it was mine and my picks for the best.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:40.160]   It's my favorite smart display, one of the best products of the year.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.160]   There it is.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.160]   There's the home button.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.640]   Now, normally what we have to do, I think Stacey correct me because...
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.840]   But I think you just say, "Go home."
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.440]   You say, "Okay, you swiped up or something."
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.080]   I have a different one in front of me.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.880]   I live my other way downstairs.
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.120]   Everything else is gestures in that OS.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.400]   Yeah, so now you'll have a home button.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.400]   That's kind of nice.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.280]   I mean, because some people look at that and they're like, "What do I do?"
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.800]   Right.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:10.520]   It's definitely the case with Amazon Echo that you can be in a state and it's not your
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.520]   normal home state.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.960]   And you have to say, "I know with Echo you say Echo go home."
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.960]   You're drunk.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:16.960]   Whoops.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:19.360]   And it will take you back there.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.360]   And now the final...
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.080]   Oh no, second to final story.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:30.440]   All US users using Android and Google's messages should have RCS enabled.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.440]   It's built in.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:32.440]   Okay, this is where I want your help guys.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.440]   I can't figure it out.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.440]   I don't have it.
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:35.440]   Oh, thank you.
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.440]   And hard hit.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.440]   You know we have stuff about that.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.440]   Really?
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.400]   Well, is this why all my texts are suddenly dark blue instead of light blue?
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   Yes.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.000]   I don't remember it changing color.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   Thank you, Kirk.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000]   I do carsto, but no.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.560]   Yeah, they changed color like not this morning, but maybe this morning.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:54.000]   See, I don't know because I still use Hangouts because it's on the desktop.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.120]   It's on my iPhone and it's on my Android phone.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.120]   I would love to use.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.480]   Oh, so I just got this message.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.720]   Chat features are ready.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.720]   You can now use chat features with others.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.720]   That's it.
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:04.720]   We have them too.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.720]   That's it.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.400]   You can turn these features off anytime from settings.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.400]   Got it.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.400]   So one of the features.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.400]   The problem was that...
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:14.880]   When iOS people text you, they can see it.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:20.280]   The problem was that this was something that was supposed to be implemented by individual
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.800]   carriers.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.160]   And the individual carriers just dragged their feet.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.760]   They didn't want to use RCS.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.960]   So Google finally just said, "Fine.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:28.960]   Fine.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.560]   We're going to run our own RCS server and we're going to do it ourselves."
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:39.080]   So they have now completed this a little bit earlier than they had promised.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:43.520]   It updates to both Google Messages and the Carrier Services app may be required to enable
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.520]   the new shot.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.520]   How do I do that?
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.520]   So wait.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.520]   So Carson and I have a question.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.520]   What do I have to do?
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.520]   What do I find clear?
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:53.520]   No, the fact that you see it means you're up to date.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.520]   All right, you're done.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.520]   But I don't see...
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:00.320]   You know how all your friends on iPhones, they like your text and is it Android user?
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.320]   You get so-and-so.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.320]   Love.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.320]   Do you have a message?
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.320]   Yeah, or do whatever.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.080]   But I don't see any cool hearts or...
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:10.920]   I mean, I can heart something, but I can't heart a message.
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:11.920]   Nothing different.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:12.920]   Or maybe I can.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:13.920]   Let's see.
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:14.920]   Long press it, maybe?
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.400]   Yeah, I'm long pressing.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.400]   Nothing.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.400]   I'm assuming...
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.400]   And I'm doing this with Carson.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.400]   Carson, you're there.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.400]   You should turn it off and back on again.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.280]   We should point out that this isn't designed to have feature parity between Apple's eye
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.280]   messages.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:28.200]   Wait, you have Carson's phone number?
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.680]   I don't have Carson's phone number.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:30.680]   Wait, Carson, is that you...
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:33.840]   Don't on Carson's needs a no list.
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:37.080]   Actually, Carson, look on his face.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.120]   I'll hit you up, Jeff.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.080]   I'm assuming this is Carson.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:42.080]   It might be someone else.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.080]   Carson is this...
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:44.080]   Carson, but...
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.080]   You have Carson, but...
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.960]   Yes, I see your message saying, "Are you okay?"
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.280]   Why didn't you just send me Ruak?
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.280]   That's so much faster.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.280]   Is that what the...
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:55.680]   If kids say, "Are you okay?"
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.920]   Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock,
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.680]   Did you ever watch LA's story?
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:01.680]   The billboard doesn't...
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:02.680]   Oh, that's right.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:03.680]   The billboard doesn't.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:04.680]   Are you okay?
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:05.680]   And then he's like, "Don't...
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.160]   That's my favorite movie in all the world, you guys."
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.160]   Oh, I'll tell Steve you said hi.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.720]   I just said I like a movie.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:15.080]   I'll amplify it for you.
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:17.000]   I got a message from my son.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.280]   I think it was Sunday.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:22.680]   I was out shooting and he sends testing.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.120]   I'm like, "What do you want?
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.120]   You know I'm out shooting.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:27.520]   I don't want to answer my phone."
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:28.520]   Testing.
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:31.000]   And he sent the nut on me and says, "I got the update.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   I got the update."
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.320]   I'm like, "Really?
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.840]   You couldn't test that with people in the house?"
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:40.240]   I got to step out for just a second to do our Secret Santa, but I'll be right back.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.240]   Okay.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.240]   I noticed I'm gone.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:43.240]   Well, right.
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.240]   We're doing it.
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.240]   Well, let's go.
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:46.240]   You can go too.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.520]   I'll do an ad.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.720]   Secret Santa time.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.480]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.680]   There's encryption, which is good.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:59.120]   It's not end-to-end encryption, but at least it's encrypted in transit.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:02.240]   You still have to do it on your one phone, and this is why I don't use it because I want
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.640]   to have it on my iPhone.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:07.200]   I don't use it.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:12.120]   And I guess there's chat bubbles and there's group chat and stuff like that.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:16.080]   That stuff doesn't really matter to me, but I get it on a different--
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:17.080]   Kids want.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:19.080]   It's desperate for the small ones.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:24.280]   Honestly, this is a, I think, a holding action hoping that Apple doesn't release messages
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:27.160]   for entry because the minute Apple does, it's all over.
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.160]   It's done.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.760]   Everybody else in the rest of the world uses WhatsApp.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:31.760]   Right.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.800]   I use all of them.
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:34.800]   Or line.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800]   Well, it depends what you're talking to, right?
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.800]   That's the problem.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.400]   One app that everybody uses, I wish there weren't.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.440]   But I'm kind of OK with that because I've set my notifications.
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.440]   So if I--
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.440]   Oh, yeah, you know.
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.880]   Like I know who's on WhatsApp, and I'm like, "I can ignore that."
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:47.880]   Exactly.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:48.880]   Is it mostly Europeans?
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:53.720]   No, it's actually-- we made it-- this is actually a great pro tip for anybody who's
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:54.840]   like, for schools and stuff.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:59.440]   We made a parent's group chat for my kids' class.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:02.440]   And it's great because you can add as many people as you want.
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.000]   You don't have limitations.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.640]   And it's vendor neutral.
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:12.080]   And we hang out and talk about our kids and plan things and do things like you get WhatsApp's
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.520]   like, "Hey, I'm running late.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.960]   Can anyone pick up my kid at school?"
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:16.960]   It's really handy.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.960]   I wish I had friends.
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:25.520]   I use line for my friends back home in our fantasy football league.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:28.160]   Because that's a Japanese.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.640]   How did that happen?
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:34.880]   We started out with WhatsApp, but we enjoyed line a little bit more because of some of
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:38.880]   the Googly bubbliness or some of the other members that I didn't really care.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:44.640]   So you should probably both know then about the WhatsApp bug that completely wipes out
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.440]   group chats with a single message.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.440]   Oh, nice.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.440]   Outstanding.
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:53.920]   It's such a-- it's just causes a sweet-- a sweet, a swift and complete crash of the entire
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:32:01.320]   WhatsApp application, which is so severe-- this autoplay has got to stop-- this is so severe
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:06.080]   that you can't return to the group chat or access any of the chat history.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:09.280]   So all of that conversation would be lost.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.280]   I'm full with that.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.280]   What's that?
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.280]   You should have fixed.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.280]   Yeah, right.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:16.600]   You got to update.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:17.840]   That's the bottom line update here.
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.680]   WhatsApp was discovered in August.
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:23.760]   But they're not aware of anybody actually taking advantage of it.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:24.760]   That's what's up.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.720]   One and a half.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:30.640]   Thank you, Chance, the rapper.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:31.640]   That's good.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.280]   That's the new end to--
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.080]   Well played, what's up?
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.080]   Well played.
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.080]   Well played.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.080]   That's the new end to--
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.080]   Well played.
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:41.080]   Well played.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.080]   Well played.
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:51.960]   Stacey was out here for-- or down here for our best of a Twitter episode, which will
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:57.840]   air, I think, the week after-- week, the Sunday after Christmas.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:01.240]   And you know, it's a shame, Stacey, because we recorded it early.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:06.320]   Since we recorded it, there have been dozens of articles about the best games of the decade,
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.320]   the best apps.
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:12.800]   There was a great article about all of your favorite memes of the 2018s.
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.400]   And we didn't have the advantage of any of that.
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.720]   But we managed to cover most of it.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:19.160]   Oh my god, if we had more content, that show was--
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.160]   Oh my god.
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.160]   You want to know what--
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:26.760]   I mean, Mary Jo and I had to sneak out during an ad read for a bathroom break.
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:27.760]   I know.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:28.760]   It was a long show.
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:30.640]   That's why we're astronaut diapers.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:31.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:32.640]   No, GMI.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:33.640]   GMI.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.640]   That's what that sound was.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:37.640]   Yeah, all of a sudden I go--
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:38.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:39.640]   Oh.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:40.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:46.080]   I look back at the top apps and games of the decade from App Annie, which has been counting
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:50.040]   them this whole time, the most downloaded apps of the decade.
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:51.040]   Guests.
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.040]   Now you guys--
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.040]   Facebook.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.040]   Yeah, that's good guests.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:55.040]   But you were looking at it.
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.120]   Did you know or did you guess?
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.120]   What's up?
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.120]   Oh my god.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.120]   All four of the top ones are owned by Facebook.
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.040]   All four.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.640]   It's Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp Messenger, and Instagram.
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.800]   And that's worldwide 2010 to 2019.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.560]   Look at TikTok coming up at the end of the day.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:16.080]   Yeah, because TikTok didn't exist till last night, right?
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.080]   The end of the day.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:18.080]   Or maybe it did, but it wasn't.
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.080]   It wasn't.
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.080]   The end of the day, okay.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.080]   Oh man.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.080]   Now it's already up there.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.080]   Snapchat, Skype, TikTok.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.400]   You see browser, which is, I guess, used in China.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.400]   That's from Alibaba.
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:28.400]   Okay.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.200]   YouTube and Twitter round out the top 10.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:34.120]   I got sucked into a TikTok black hole this morning.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:35.120]   It was fun.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.840]   I deleted TikTok because of TikTok black holes.
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:44.560]   I installed it and I've watched maybe two things for about 10 seconds total.
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.240]   I don't even know why it's still on my phone.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:49.080]   It's easy to get in that thing where you just scroll and scroll and scroll and scroll
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:50.480]   and scroll and that black hole.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.480]   They're just--
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.480]   They were also dumb.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:53.480]   They were just dumb.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.480]   They were dumb.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.480]   They were just dumb.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.480]   They were just dumb.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:57.480]   They were dumb.
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:58.480]   I'm like, oh my god.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:34:59.480]   It reminds me of Vine.
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:00.480]   I never really had an interest in--
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:01.480]   It's just like Vine.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:02.480]   It is Vine.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:03.480]   Yeah, basically.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.020]   And I've been trying to think about content to create for it.
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:07.020]   And I just can't do it.
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:08.220]   You guys are doing stuff.
[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:09.220]   I saw the hook.
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.920]   Square peg and a round hole.
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:11.920]   That's how I feel.
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:14.720]   You know, you all did one about throwing away the puppet boxes.
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:19.920]   Yeah, Twit-- it's a TwitTok, which I think is a very clever handle.
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.280]   That is like clever marketing team doing stuff.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.920]   You know what we need?
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.920]   We need ant doing dances.
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:27.920]   That will--
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:29.920]   We need you to sing in and do a dances.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:30.920]   Dance?
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:31.920]   You're not a dancer.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:32.920]   I am not a dancer.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:35.320]   I'm not either than I would pick up dance.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:36.320]   I know my limits.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:41.400]   Yeah, I think at the Christmas party, there were a lot of people tick-tocking Twit.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:44.880]   We should have done some cheesy tik-toks because really what you need to do is layer
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:45.880]   on the cheese.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:46.880]   Layer on the cheese?
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:48.880]   Layer on the cheese.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.880]   You could do it.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:55.480]   Go on that over to holidays with the family because I am clearly cheesy according to them.
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:59.680]   I got a lot of trouble, by the way, with Wisconsin.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.680]   Really?
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:02.680]   The state?
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:09.560]   Yesterday, we were talking about I Fix It's Tear Down of the new Apple Mac Pro.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:10.560]   Cheese Grater.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:11.560]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.560]   The original Mac Pro was called the Cheese Grater because it looked like a cheese grater.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:22.360]   And this new one is even more cheese gratery, and I Fix It grated Cheese with it.
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.360]   Oh boy.
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.360]   Which is disgusting.
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.960]   Oh boy.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:28.160]   And I said...
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.160]   Jesus.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:32.560]   Oh, that's probably cheap Wisconsin cheese.
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:33.560]   Oh, dude.
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:34.560]   No.
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.560]   How dare you?
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:37.560]   Wow.
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.560]   That was dumb.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.560]   That was dumb.
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:42.920]   I'm not saying all Wisconsin cheese is bad, but what is that?
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:43.920]   Teary.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.720]   In my opinion.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:47.720]   That's American cheese.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:48.720]   Not Wisconsin cheese.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.720]   Oh, dare you.
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:51.720]   Orange cheese is dyed orange.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:55.120]   There's no such thing as orange cheese.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.120]   It's...
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.120]   That's...
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:01.920]   Wisconsin cheese that is cheap, not cheap Wisconsin cheese.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.920]   What's the diff?
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:04.920]   There's a big diff.
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.520]   They got beta carotene infused cheese.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:09.920]   Cheap modifies Wisconsin.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.320]   Ergo always comes cheap.
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:13.560]   Oh man, I heard from Wisconsin, babe.
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.560]   As you should.
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:15.560]   I apologize.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.360]   I love Wisconsin.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.360]   I love my Tillamook.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.360]   Is that Wisconsin?
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:20.360]   Tillamook is not...
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.360]   No, that's like Oregon.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.360]   That's Oregon.
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:23.360]   That's right.
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.360]   Come on, man.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.360]   I'm gonna say you like it.
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.320]   She's heard in the Packers and you're fine.
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:29.160]   I do have a cheese head.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.160]   It's a packer's hat.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:34.160]   The squeakers.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.160]   Are you some big enemies?
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.160]   Shame.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.160]   Shame.
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.160]   Shame.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.160]   Shame.
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:40.160]   Shame.
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.160]   Oh.
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.360]   Can we get a badger running across the screen for the...
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:44.360]   Shame.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:47.960]   That would be awesome.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.960]   Top 10 apps by revenue.
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:52.560]   2010 to 2019.
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.560]   Netflix number one.
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.960]   Tinder number two.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.960]   Wow.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.160]   Pandora music number three.
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:01.160]   That's been around for the whole 10 years, right?
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.960]   Tencent video line.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:03.960]   You're a...
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:04.960]   You're a...
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:05.960]   IQE which is...
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:08.660]   What do you make for a line?
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:10.060]   Line is Japanese.
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.160]   But you know, the thing about line is you can...
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.160]   You get a little sticker packs and things.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.160]   You can buy a lot of stuff including...
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:20.360]   Like in China, what you can buy.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.560]   Like WeChat in China, you do e-commerce.
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.560]   So there's a lot of money to be made.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.360]   Didn't know that online.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:28.760]   Spotify, YouTube, HBO now, Quai.
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.960]   That's just because your HBO is so expensive.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:34.960]   15 bucks a month, baby.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.840]   YouTube fascinates me.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.520]   And I guess that's from people renting movies and shows or what have you.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:43.520]   It's just so huge.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.520]   Well, you have the YouTube red.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:45.520]   Oh, red.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.520]   I actually have that.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:49.520]   So...
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.520]   I'm confused now.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.000]   But I'm confused now.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.760]   Because I got YouTube music because Google says they're phasing Google music out, right?
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:58.760]   They are.
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.760]   They're phasing it out.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.760]   I'm still leaving it on Twitter.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:01.760]   In favor of YouTube.
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.640]   Now, if you buy YouTube music, I think you also get all the other red and everything, right?
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.640]   You get premium.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:07.640]   They don't call it red anymore.
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:09.520]   What happens to my YouTube music?
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.520]   My Google music stuff then.
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:12.520]   Good question.
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:13.520]   Am I going to have to...
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.520]   Oh, geez.
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:20.120]   I tweeted them about that a couple months ago and never really got a definite answer.
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:24.320]   Because people uploaded a lot of their stuff to Google music originally.
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.320]   I bought stuff.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:28.280]   And I don't want to scare people, but that's the story, right?
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.280]   That that's coming.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.280]   Mm-hmm.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.280]   And I just react to grow accurately.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.120]   Yeah, you enjoy scaring people.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:36.200]   I love scaring people because that's...
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:37.480]   You know, I'm a link-baked guy.
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:41.760]   I don't like the YouTube music app, so I'm still holding on to Google Play.
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:42.760]   It's got better.
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.120]   I should have put this in the changelog.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:50.640]   The YouTube music app has now added discover playlists like Apple and Spotify do with stuff
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.080]   that they know from what you've listened to in the past.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:54.080]   So I think...
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.080]   Actually, it's gotten a lot better.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:59.480]   I wanted to roll the family over to it, so I warned them and said, "Hey, go ahead and
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:01.320]   start installing the YouTube music."
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.800]   What did the hardhead say?
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.840]   And I got to them before they got to me.
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:05.840]   I said, "No, it's crap.
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:06.840]   Don't even bother."
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:07.840]   Just say, "We're just..."
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:11.160]   How to transfer favorite tracks from Google Play music to YouTube.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.160]   There you go.
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.160]   Connect Google Play music.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.160]   Select the recommended playlist.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:19.840]   They got moods, they got live performances, new releases.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.800]   I think they're actually starting to curate this.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:22.800]   Okay.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:23.800]   That's looking better.
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:24.800]   Oh, no.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:25.800]   And it has dark spots.
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.400]   There's no easy way to transfer Google Play music playlists to YouTube music right now.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:29.400]   Outstand says...
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:30.400]   Is that the playlist?
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:31.400]   Have a similar intro.
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.360]   I'd like to have my playlist over there.
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:35.360]   I would like to have playlists.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.400]   What about the stuff I bought?
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.080]   No, no, no, that will count.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.080]   You'll have all that.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.080]   Interesting.
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:47.200]   So we were talking a couple of weeks ago about ISOC, the Internet Society.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:52.960]   They had owned the rights to the .org domain, the nonprofit domain.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:55.200]   They had initially said, "Well, get ready.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.680]   We might raise the price a little bit."
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:03.280]   Then they sold it to a third party, the eliminated price caps, and then almost immediately sold
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:04.440]   it to a third party.
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:08.600]   I can is now weighing in.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.800]   This is actually good news.
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:11.560]   They have 30 days to weigh in.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:17.160]   Of course, what they're concerned about is that essentially this is going from a nonprofit
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:23.400]   to a private equity firm, which might try to raise prices to make more money.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.400]   I like the might.
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:26.400]   Might.
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:27.400]   Might.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:36.000]   I can, apparently, is still an overseer of all this.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.240]   They initially said, "We don't have authority to stop it."
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:47.000]   But now they noted that the .org registry agreement between PIR and I can requires the
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.080]   public Internet registry to obtain I can's prior approval.
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:52.920]   Somebody looked at the contract.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:55.520]   Thank goodness.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:59.760]   Somebody looked at the contract and now they're going to take a look at this.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.920]   Hey, that's Andrew's company.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.920]   Sorry.
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:03.920]   Right there.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:07.080]   As Domain Name Wire noted in a news story, that's Andrew.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.080]   Oh, that's Andrew.
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.520]   Oh, you're hubbing in the news.
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:12.520]   Ouch.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:13.520]   The news.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.400]   Whether I can can block the transfer using that standard might to quote Andrew, is it Higgum
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:19.400]   Bothem?
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.080]   No, it's Solomon.
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:22.320]   Andrew Solomon.
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:23.320]   That's David.
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:25.320]   Solomon.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:28.360]   To quote Andrew, I have a.
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:29.360]   Might.
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:35.800]   Might ultimately have to be determined by the courts end quote and that's what's up.
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.800]   That's what's up.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:41.800]   Anyway, I'm glad to be serious.
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.960]   I'm glad they're paying attention.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:44.960]   Yes.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:49.080]   Chance did it for hockey and then he did it recently for e-sports.
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.080]   It's his new.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.160]   So, after this, you can go look for that.
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:55.200]   That's what's up.
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:57.200]   That's what's up.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:03.880]   Oh, I'm going to end with this happy one.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:04.880]   All right.
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:07.720]   The far side is back, baby.
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:13.040]   Gary Larson, who very famously retired in 1995 saying, I don't want to do this so long
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:16.080]   I become a mediocre cartoonist.
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:20.200]   For 24 years, we've been living without new far side comics.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:24.640]   He is set to release his first new work in 24 years.
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:31.880]   The far side.com will feature previously unseen sketches.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:37.960]   But Gary Larson says there will be new content.
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:40.720]   So I don't know if you're a far side fan.
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:43.680]   I am a huge far side fan.
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:45.920]   This one's from 1994.
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:48.000]   This one's from 1990.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.720]   Still no new content.
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:51.960]   Let's hope someday.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:55.160]   I think Gary Larson is one of the greats.
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:44:03.560]   So the far side and Gary Larson are back, expect cows, dinosaurs and wars.
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:06.840]   This is one of those things I've seen in passing but never really knew what it was.
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.480]   I think it might be maybe it's the Jeff's and my era.
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:11.680]   No, because I grew up with those.
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:14.400]   I had all those when I was a kid.
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:20.640]   He had a twisted great way of...
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:24.520]   My favorite is probably one of the most politically incorrect cartoons you would ever see.
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:29.960]   Which is the two alligators sitting on the riverbank having just eaten a baby.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.720]   And it was like...
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:33.720]   Go on.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:34.720]   It's just perfect.
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:37.800]   No fur or claws or anything.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.560]   Like one's telling the other about its meal.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:45.160]   I mean, yeah, it was pretty wrong.
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.160]   But in a good way.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:47.640]   But in a good way.
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:51.640]   Sometimes I look at Gary's cartoons and I just don't get them like this one.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.640]   Why Gary?
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:55.120]   You've always had the power to go home.
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:45:00.280]   Just close your eyes, quack three times and think to yourself, there's no place like
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:01.280]   home.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:03.800]   There's no place like home.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:05.720]   I think it's just weird and fun.
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:07.680]   I mean, you know.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:09.080]   There's cows watching.
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.640]   I don't.
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:13.920]   I mean, in the far side, everything's going to be like there's another...
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:16.400]   This is part two.
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:21.560]   And so he's going from a color world with Glinda the Good Witch to black and white and had
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.560]   celled up.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:25.880]   All the women like you looked like you and Uncle Bob, all the cows looked like you.
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:28.280]   And Ernie, there were cavemen that looked like you.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:30.800]   And there were these nerdy little kids like you, Billy.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.280]   And there were monsters and stupid looking things and animals can talk.
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:38.080]   Some of it was confusing and oh wow, there's no place like home.
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.680]   I'm thinking this might be the last Gary Eilice and cartoon.
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:43.720]   Yeah, that theory.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:46.000]   1995 might have been his retirement.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000]   Anyway, welcome back.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.960]   This is really great news.
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:57.960]   Oh, you like the real reason dinosaurs became extinct and the Simpsons parody of it.
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:01.320]   I'm going to have to do some research because I don't think I can pull it up.
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:05.760]   One day Wilson, I'll be sitting at that desk.
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:12.880]   Cross the room.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:16.160]   Let's do one more mention of our fine sponsors.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:19.120]   And then I will let you guys make some pics and we'll be out of here.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.120]   What do you say?
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:21.120]   Sure.
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:22.520]   Our show today brought to you by the browser.
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:23.680]   I'm using right now.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:24.680]   Love it.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:25.680]   Brave.
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:27.440]   Brave is based on Chrome.
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.960]   Actually it's based on the open source Chromium project, which Google's Chrome is also based
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:31.960]   on.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.520]   So it has all the chrome deliciousness you love.
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:37.880]   But with none of the Google events, you might not like so much.
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:40.760]   Just a few months ago, Google announced, yeah, we're going to turn off the ability for
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:43.080]   UBlock Origin to work our adblocker won't work anymore.
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.320]   And I said, what?
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:47.640]   And thank goodness I'm using Brave.
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:51.720]   Brave is faster because it's privacy focused.
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:53.760]   So it's like you get this benefit.
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:47:00.000]   See, it turns out if you don't let download all that extra JavaScript and the bad ads
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:05.960]   and all the extra images and all the privacy, you know, trackers, anti-privacy trackers,
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:11.200]   you get much better performance up to six times faster than the competitors.
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:14.440]   Brave gives you unmatched speed online privacy, blocks trackers.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:16.400]   It's a better user experience.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:17.760]   It's free.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:22.960]   You can have more than one browser on your device, Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:23.960]   Get Brave.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:24.960]   Just try it out.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:25.960]   It's easy to use.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:29.360]   You could set it up with one, you know, click of the mouse and port all your bookmarks.
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.320]   You could switch browsers efficiently, saves you battery life and data costs too, because
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:39.440]   if you're not downloading all that stuff, you also save on battery and data.
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:43.800]   You all your favorite Chrome extensions still work, although you'll need far fewer because
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:49.440]   in fact, all I've got installed on this is LastPass because Brave does everything else.
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:52.600]   And I love this because one of the things I always feel guilty, we're an ad supported
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.600]   network.
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:56.040]   I don't want to take money out of the mouth of tech republic or I'm more all those great
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:57.400]   sites I use.
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.600]   But I am blocking their ads.
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:04.160]   So with Brave basic attention tokens, you can give publishers back their fair share of web
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.240]   revenue.
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:10.440]   You can earn tokens by looking at privacy respecting ads and then automatically easily
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.560]   tip your favorite content creators and brave.
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:15.800]   So they get paid even though you weren't seeing the ads.
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:19.400]   They don't want to bog you down anymore than you want to be bogged down.
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:20.480]   You could trust Brave.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:22.040]   It includes so many great features.
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:28.920]   In fact, my suggestion is download it now, brave.com/twit, immediately go to the preferences and
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:30.960]   just look at all the things it'll do.
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:33.520]   It's just fantastic.
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:37.120]   Including by the way, a private window that's really private, it uses Tor.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.800]   So you absolutely are anonymous.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.160]   You can't say that about the private browsing in any other browser.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.640]   Brave.com/twit.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:48.440]   Yesterday was about big tech today is about us.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.440]   Use Brave.
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.440]   I do.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.440]   You'll learn a lot.
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:57.480]   And it's just all the benefits of Chrome without all the baggage.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:59.280]   Stacy, what's your pick of the week this week?
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:05.880]   Ooh, I've got something you guys are going to love.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:08.360]   This is Smart Dry.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:09.920]   Smart Dry?
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.400]   Smart Dry.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:15.400]   One of the more common questions we get on the show is I have a washing machine.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:17.640]   Sorry, I have a dryer and I want to know what it's done.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:20.440]   I thought it was for my astronaut and diapers.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:21.440]   Okay.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.440]   Nope.
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.440]   Nope, it is not.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:26.000]   Although there's a company called Monit that is actually doing that for adult diapers
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.520]   and it's a very important.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.680]   Yes, I was being facetious, but it is an important thing.
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:31.680]   I will.
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:36.040]   Father Robert came back from CES and he drank a ton of water.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.040]   I remember that.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.040]   I remember that.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:40.840]   And his Monit said, "Oh, you better go to the bathroom now!"
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.840]   I remember that.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.840]   So the other one, that's actually for kidney stuff.
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:51.800]   The new one at CES will be actually detecting when they're damp so they can notify a caregiver.
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:54.840]   Will you take us around CES a little bit?
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.960]   I'll pay you.
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:00.840]   I would love to and we'll figure out.
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:04.640]   I'm just not, I'm going to pretend you're not a stipend.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:05.640]   A stipend.
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:06.640]   A stipend.
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:08.840]   I'm sure we can figure out that.
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:09.840]   You're a freelancer.
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:10.840]   You have a freelancer.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:13.800]   We're going to be down there and we're not going to be down there.
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:16.800]   We'd love to meet up and we're going to meet up with Dicty Bartolo, the Giam.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:20.040]   He is with us to show us all the crap he's got for the Sanzexpo.
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:21.040]   Sanzexpo.
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.320]   Samable Samad, our car guy to go to the North Hall.
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.720]   We're going to have a visit with what else?
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:28.840]   We're going to do TVs with Scott Wilkinson.
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:30.640]   And then I would like to see Miss Stacy.
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.640]   Stacy or Kevin?
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.640]   One of us will do it.
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:34.640]   One of you would be great.
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:35.640]   Okay.
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:36.640]   Maybe both.
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:37.640]   So tell us about dry heat.
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:38.640]   Smart dry.
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:39.640]   Whatever.
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:40.640]   Yes.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.640]   This is a sensor.
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:44.080]   It's got a strong magnet on the other side and that goes into your dryer.
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:46.240]   It sticks to the drum and it sticks really well.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:48.760]   I was kind of surprised.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:51.960]   And it detects when you're closer dry.
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:56.520]   And I was, this doesn't sound like a problem that many people have.
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:59.400]   Well, most dryers do that, don't they?
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:01.320]   So mine does this.
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:02.480]   But it dries.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:03.480]   But not well.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.360]   My clothes are still damp sometimes when it says they're dry.
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.360]   This actually dries.
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:13.720]   And a lot of times it will tell me before I can set it up so it will warn me, for example,
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:15.440]   if my delicates are too hot.
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:16.440]   That's pretty cool.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.440]   That's good.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:23.000]   And I get a notification and usually it's about 10 minutes before my dryer actually says
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.960]   it's done.
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:28.080]   So I can actually, yeah, I can use less energy.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.000]   So I do see likes too.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.480]   She has a thing and I've never quite figured out where she takes some of her stuff out
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.480]   before it's fully tied.
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:36.480]   I do that too.
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.480]   So it doesn't have wrinkles.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:39.480]   Right.
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:42.240]   Well, and also so it doesn't shrink and it extends the life of the clothes.
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.240]   Right.
[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:44.240]   Okay.
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:45.240]   You do that too.
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:46.240]   Your clothes are fancier.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:47.240]   Yes.
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:49.240]   So this is the full product.
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:52.440]   There's a tiny little hub that this talks to this via Bluetooth.
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:55.240]   So this needs to be plugged in close to your dryer.
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:58.800]   And I'm going to say the one thing I hate about this and it's because it's a it's kind
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:01.600]   of a it's a very small company that does this.
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:05.360]   This sticks out of your wall and it's ugly and it's big.
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:12.600]   But they'll figure this out because basically all this is is a generic USB converter.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:13.760]   So they're going to get there.
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.760]   It's $50.
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:20.280]   Oh, you can ask Echo if your clothes are dry.
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:21.280]   Yes.
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:25.320]   And it also turns your notification ring on your echoes yellow.
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:26.880]   Oh, this is awesome.
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:28.880]   It's I mean, it's nice.
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:33.280]   I could I said it like to do what you do you you and Lisa do where it's there's still
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:34.280]   damp.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:35.280]   Yes.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:37.360]   So you could set a little lower alert.
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.360]   Yes.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:43.000]   If you set it on delegates, it will make it so they stay most like slightly damp.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000]   Yes.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.920]   So she wants this is I mean, I don't know.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:51.560]   I think this is kind of nice because the dryer is not nearly that smart.
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:52.560]   Right.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:56.080]   And it's not going to be smart unless you're crazy and you want to go out and buy a brand
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:57.080]   new dryer.
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.080]   Right.
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:01.800]   So do laundry smarter.com smart dry.
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:02.800]   Nice.
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:06.040]   That's that's my my pick for y'all.
[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:10.200]   Will the echo say Stacy, your clothes are getting dry.
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:13.800]   It will not, but my next now that I've got this and I'm playing with it, I set it up
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:14.800]   on the echo.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:18.760]   I'm wondering and I'm pretty sure I can do a routine where when that notification comes
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:19.760]   it'll turn a light.
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:22.360]   And if that's going to be my effort.
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:23.360]   Good.
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:29.120]   Pretty cool to turn my old beat up dryer that is probably about 10 years old turning
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:30.520]   into a smart device.
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:33.480]   And the hackers can hack your dryer.
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:34.480]   Oh, yes.
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:40.040]   And your dryer is a Faraday cage for people who are asking and that's fun.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:44.400]   That's part of the fun engineering they did and why they are this has to be within 10
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.120]   to 15 feet of your choice.
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:47.120]   Okay.
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.120]   Close.
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:54.440]   But it's not it's not undoable and it sends a signal every minute, every minute, every
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:55.440]   20 seconds.
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:56.440]   I can't remember.
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:57.440]   Correct.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:58.440]   I'm sorry, Dave.
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:53:59.440]   Your closer dry.
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:02.800]   Jeff Jarvis number.
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:03.800]   What the hell?
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:06.640]   I'm going to be sleeping with this tonight.
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:08.440]   Jeff, your hair is dry.
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:13.000]   Jeff is bringing the weird devices.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.400]   My color is this thing.
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:15.400]   Is this better?
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:16.720]   Oh, this is good.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:20.200]   This is a sleep apnea detection thing.
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:21.200]   Oh, nice.
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:22.400]   Yeah, I had to wear one.
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:23.840]   One of those recently.
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:26.840]   This is cheaper than doing a sleep study.
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:35.200]   So now this is your nose and I got to put on up there and then there's three sensors
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:36.200]   in here.
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:37.200]   Is this the better?
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:38.200]   Who makes the sign?
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.760]   I would have rubbed my chest.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.760]   This one's a sleep apnea.
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:47.560]   Yeah, for sleep apnea because it was measuring my heart and do you have a pulse oximeter
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:49.400]   or they did away with the pulse oximeter?
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:51.640]   Well, they have three sensors on my forehead.
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:52.640]   Maybe that's what it is.
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:55.080]   So that's where they're getting the oxygenation from.
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:55:00.280]   Yeah, this was actually my resurgence pick of best gadget of 2019.
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:02.280]   One of them better BEDD.
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:04.160]   I don't know if this is the better.
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:05.160]   No ER.
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:06.160]   No ER.
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:07.160]   No ER.
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:08.160]   No ER.
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:09.160]   There it is.
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:10.160]   But ER.
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:11.160]   ER.
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:12.160]   We saw it.
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:13.160]   I don't know if that's the one you're using.
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:15.160]   Do the hospital or a doctor provide you with that?
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:16.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:17.160]   God knows what it costs.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:18.160]   Yeah, this is different.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.160]   This is less expensive and smaller.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:22.160]   Did that's the one?
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:23.160]   I almost saw it.
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:24.160]   PepCon.
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:26.160]   Here in San Francisco.
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:28.160]   Huh.
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:29.160]   Cool.
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:30.160]   Well, good luck, Jeff.
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:31.160]   Thanks.
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:32.160]   I'm not looking forward to it.
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:33.400]   I don't want to know.
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:35.160]   I just don't want to know.
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:38.160]   If you have sleep apnea, you should know.
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:39.160]   I know.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.760]   That is something that takes years off.
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:42.760]   No, I do not.
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:43.760]   I just know.
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:46.160]   It's what killed Princess Leia.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:47.160]   Isn't it?
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:50.360]   Isn't that what?
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.440]   I think a life of drugs and hard living and other things help.
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:55.440]   I think so.
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:56.440]   I read a lot of things.
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:02.280]   It could be just Hollywood gossip, but the proximate cause of her death was.
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:04.160]   It does create wear and tear on your heart.
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:08.240]   It also is an indication or helps lead to dementia.
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:11.600]   There's a lot of things you should probably get it checked out if you suspect you might
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:12.600]   have it.
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:13.600]   I don't know.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:14.600]   I'm just tired in the morning.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.600]   Isn't that normal?
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:16.800]   That might just be age.
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:17.800]   Yeah.
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:18.800]   It's cold and tired.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:19.800]   It's your dying.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:20.800]   It's just wearing pants.
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:26.000]   Six months after Carrie Fisher's sudden death, the Los Angeles County Corner has identified
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.800]   sleep apnea as a factor.
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:32.040]   Me and the corner like this.
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:35.840]   And by the way, I just want to let you know that I set Gina Trapani up with Steve Martin.
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:37.680]   I could do the same for you.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:40.240]   Anytime Stacy, just let me know.
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:41.240]   You said he married?
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:43.400]   No, it wasn't that kind of a set up.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:45.760]   Yes, his wife is real.
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:47.760]   I was like, because I considered it.
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:48.760]   I considered it.
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:50.760]   And I have a whole ask for Steve Martin.
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:51.760]   She's a writer.
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:55.840]   Gina had an app that saved all your tweets.
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:59.840]   And he was writing a book which he eventually put out on Twitter of all his very, very funny
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:00.840]   tweets.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:03.160]   And she worked with him to get that database.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:06.040]   Oh, I don't have any useful skills for Steve Martin.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:07.040]   Oh, OK.
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.040]   I play the harmonica.
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:09.040]   That's good.
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:10.040]   He plays the banjo.
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:11.040]   It's a match made in heaven.
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:12.040]   That's awesome.
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:14.040]   Oh, King Ty.
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:15.040]   Steve Martin.
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:18.120]   Buried in his jammies.
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.920]   Aunt Pruitt.
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:26.360]   My pick of the week is advice to be mindful of your holiday lights.
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:27.360]   Why?
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:35.120]   So, friend of mine, Captain Jeff of the Airline Pilot Guy podcast, he flies for a specific
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:36.200]   airline.
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:42.080]   And he happened to be on a news station here recently talking about those Christmas lights
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:45.640]   shining up and hitting the pilot cockpit.
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:46.640]   No, really?
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:47.640]   If you're in some lasers.
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:48.840]   I know lasers are terrible.
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:49.840]   Right.
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:54.600]   And a lot of people are using these lasers for part of their decorations now.
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:57.640]   And so I wanted to just give a shout out to him.
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:58.640]   Look at this.
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:00.880]   When you see this, you got to think, you know, some of this is going to be boring.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:02.080]   Some of that stuff just pops in.
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.760]   He talked about, you know, you're going in on an approach or whatever.
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:06.640]   And then all of a sudden you get flashed.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:09.240]   It's pretty scary and pretty disoriented.
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:11.480]   And I never even thought about that.
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:13.360]   That's by the way, a great podcast.
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:14.360]   I love that podcast.
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:19.440]   But yeah, I used to live right next to Charlotte Airport, probably like within six miles.
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:26.840]   So I always saw the airplanes coming over my home and I never even considered that right
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:33.120]   next door to me was called Christmas Town USA, McAdenville, North Carolina, where they have
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:36.800]   some of the largest display of Christmas lights in the country.
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:37.720]   Yadda yadda yadda.
[01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:41.800]   And always wondered about, you know, how is that seen from above?
[01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:45.800]   You know, and then his video comes up and he's like, yeah, some of those are great, but
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:48.080]   not so great if they're shooting us in the eyes.
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:55.800]   And he just says that 7,000 laser hits on pilots in 2019.
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:56.800]   Insane.
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:57.800]   Airline Pilot Guy Show.
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:00.400]   You can find it on YouTube, YouTube.com/apgshow.
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:03.320]   This show is longer than hours.
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:04.320]   No, really?
[01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:06.320]   I don't think that was possible.
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:08.200]   It's like three hours.
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:09.440]   It's a coast to coast podcast.
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:10.760]   But it's so fun.
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:12.200]   I love listening to those guys.
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:13.200]   It's wonderful.
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.200]   Shout out to you, Captain Jeff.
[01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:18.240]   I think we could wrap this up.
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:19.240]   What do you say?
[01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:20.240]   Sure.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:22.480]   Do you have anything to contribute with you?
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:23.480]   Not really.
[01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:26.480]   I have fresh, I have fresh baked Christmas cookies downstairs.
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:28.280]   Yeah, go down and get some cookies.
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:30.760]   I hope everyone is baking cookies and gin.
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:33.520]   This is our last episode of 2019.
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:37.520]   We're going to take Christmas day and New Year's Day off, obviously.
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:41.680]   I won't be here for the eighth because that's CES.
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:43.360]   Yeah, I'll be there with you.
[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:44.360]   And you'll be there with you.
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.320]   Just be Jeff all by himself on January.
[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.320]   Good!
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:48.320]   I can fight to watch that.
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:49.320]   I can't wait to watch that.
[01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:50.480]   Can't wait to watch that.
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:53.240]   We do have a best episode for next week for Christmas Day.
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:57.600]   We'll repeat that on New Year's Day so you can catch that.
[01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:59.280]   And we will be back January 8th.
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:03.680]   It'll be somebody we don't know who will be on the show because you, me and Stacey,
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:04.920]   you're all going to be in Vegas.
[02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:05.920]   Of course.
[02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:06.920]   Is Carson taking over?
[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:07.920]   Carson.
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:08.920]   Jason, Jason Howell will be there.
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:09.920]   Okay.
[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:12.920]   With Jeff and maybe Kevin's going to be in Vegas too, right?
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.920]   Carson, why don't you come and sit on the table?
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:16.320]   I don't want to sit on the table.
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:18.160]   We don't like Carson to get out of that.
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:19.160]   No, just stay in that corner.
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:20.880]   You leave it as Cage?
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:21.880]   Yeah.
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:23.480]   He's actually barred.
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:25.480]   He's barred from leaving the cage.
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:26.920]   I'm glad we have a camera though.
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:28.920]   I got to say this is a big step up.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:32.040]   I'm going to see Carson in this cage.
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:35.600]   Tackling Carson in his corner.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:37.120]   Yeah.
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:38.440]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:41.480]   We hope you have a wonderful holiday season.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:46.920]   Actually, I now have several friends who celebrate Solstice, Winter Solstice.
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:47.920]   Not Christmas, not Hanukkah.
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:49.720]   Oh, it's so cool.
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:50.720]   Do they separate?
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:54.960]   Do they celebrate it though in the 22nd or the 21st depending on the 21st of this year?
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:55.960]   Okay.
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:59.480]   But they do have Christmas trees and all the lights and stuff because that's a Solstice
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:00.720]   celebration.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:03.640]   And then for those of you who have celebrated Festivus, of course, we're going to set up
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:08.440]   the aluminum pole and the airing of grievances will begin shortly.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:10.440]   That's every show.
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:11.440]   Every show.
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:13.760]   It's the airing of grievances.
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:19.000]   We do Twig every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.320]   If you want to watch us do it live, Twig.tv/live audio and video is there streaming.
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:30.320]   You can also join the chat room if you're there live at irc.twit.tv and hang out with
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:31.320]   that one.
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:32.760]   That's a great fun.
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:40.360]   And then for those who are listening at their leisure, we have versions of the show at Twig.tv/Twig.
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:43.160]   You can also subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:46.040]   And if you subscribe then you don't even have to think about it.
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:49.880]   It'll just appear on your device automatically.
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:53.720]   For those of you who do subscribe, there's also the asynchronous Twig community, our
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:58.320]   forums at twit.community.
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:00.160]   I think that's it everybody.
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:01.160]   Happy holidays.
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:02.160]   Go enjoy your cookie Stacy.
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:05.160]   It's been good luck in the years.
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:06.160]   Merry Christmas.
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:07.160]   Happy holidays.
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:09.400]   Have some wasale on me.
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:10.840]   We'll see you next year.
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:11.840]   Thank you aunt.
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:13.240]   We're going to see you in Vegas.
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:14.560]   Thank you everybody.
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:15.760]   Have a wonderful holiday.
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:18.400]   We'll see you in 2020.
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:19.560]   That's it for this week in Google.
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:19.560]   Bye bye.
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:29.560]   [MUSIC]
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.740]   [gentle music]
