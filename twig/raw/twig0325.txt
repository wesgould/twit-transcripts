[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.120]   latest but not just from Google, from the cloud, from social media, Facebook and Twitter. Joining us
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.800]   from ours, Technica Rana-Maddio, he's the Android guy over there. Great to have you joining us
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   Ron. We love having you on. Great to be here. Thanks. And Mike Ellingen is also here sitting next to me
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.480]   from Tech News today. Jeff has, Jeff Jarvis has the week off. He's actually traveling for the next
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.280]   two weeks. Yeah, next two weeks. For a change, he decided to travel.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.080]   Yeah, no. He just for some reason, usually when he travels, like last week, we were able to get
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.760]   him on from wherever he was. But I guess he's in the air or something like that this week.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.280]   Gina Trapanini will be with us next week filling in for Mr. Jory. So it's not crandroid. We got all
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.600]   head up. Eroshi Lockheimer says, "No, no. We're not getting rid of." Well, actually though, if you
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.680]   compare what Lockheimer said to the original Wall Street Journal story, it's pretty much the same.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.920]   So it was kind of a non-denial denial. Before we wind up, Ron, and turn him loose on this topic,
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.160]   I have a prepared statement which is that I'm really confused about what this is going to look
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.000]   like. They basically, Google gently hinted that there would be the best of Chrome OS and Android
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.680]   would be combined into a new operating system. I don't know what that means. Ron, what could
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.600]   that possibly be? What does Android need that Chrome OS has and vice versa?
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.000]   The biggest thing that the report said is that Android's going to run on PCs now,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.560]   and I think that's probably the most important thing here. A lot of people have been worried,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.400]   like, "Oh, what's going to happen to Chrome OS?" And it's like, "Chrome OS is going to hang around."
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.720]   The Wall Street Journal report says in it that Chrome OS will remain an open source operating
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.680]   system and that other companies can use to make laptops and Google engineers will continue
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.160]   maintaining it. However, Google's focus will be on extending Android to run on laptops.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.080]   That's from the Wall Street Journal report. It jives with what Google's saying, but I think Chrome OS
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.160]   will end up being the old operating system from Google and it'll hang around and get security
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.560]   updates, but all the feature stuff is, all the exciting things will come from this merged operating
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:36.400]   system. Android would need a completely new interface. What's there right now for tablets is
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.240]   horrible with a mouse and keyboard. There's been a few like janky Android laptops you can buy.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.920]   I think the HP Slatebook 14 or something was one of the latest ones. You'll need a whole new
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.560]   interface. You'll need a windowing support, so you can have apps on top of apps and all that stuff.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.680]   Third parties are going to need to make desktop apps, which is going to be super hard,
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.520]   because they can't even get third parties to make tablet apps or Google to make tablet apps,
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.280]   so that matter. That's the exciting thing. There's going to be so much that's going to need to
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.080]   change about Android. If you look at the time frame they gave on this, they said it started
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.240]   two years ago and won't be out until 2017. This is going to end up being a three to four year
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.760]   project inside of Google, which sounds like a really big deal. I have a couple of theories about
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.160]   this. Actually, I was going to try to show you, and I will show you a little later on,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.760]   the AMI version of Android running on Windows, which is really full Android. It pretty much works
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.600]   just like Android. It's not a great experience because it's on a giant screen.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.240]   Android, clearly a lot has to be done. I can't show you right now that Surface Book is locked up.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.160]   Oh, got you. Got you.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.520]   But I will show you.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.080]   Now, you know what? This is a great laptop. This Windows laptop. The problem is if you do what I
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.840]   did, which is before I logged in, I tried to remove the screen. It's just now completely confused.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.200]   It doesn't know where it's getting its input from. It doesn't know what's going on. I can't
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:13.760]   do anything. I can't even type anyway. I'll reset it. This is actually the whole
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:20.400]   class of problems that come with this. It's not accepting input. It happened because of the
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.760]   detachment. If they didn't detach, but it's confused. The video driver crashes.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.000]   The keyboard has apparently stopped working. The mouse is funky. Then all of that because I think
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.520]   it's a hard handle. The user needs a certain level of detachment to use this device.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.080]   No, because you just don't do what I just did, which was detach it before I'd fully logged in.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.280]   You're detaching it wrong.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.240]   I'm detaching it wrong. It attached it prematurely. We'll just put that away and let it think for a
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.440]   while. I've been using it all last night, Android on Windows. It's not a great experience because
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:03.600]   it's just not designed for a large. It feels weird. I really would be sad. I think you agree
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.240]   with me if Chromebook went away. I think Chromebook is awesome.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.240]   I would be super sad. I'm using one here. Of course, the touch screen versions of the
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.760]   implementation of Chrome OS, like the Chrome bases and the Chromebooks and so on,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.480]   that's a terrible implementation. I like it. I touch pixel though.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.120]   The interface is not designed for it. You're poking at file menus and then
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.280]   you're dropping down. It's a workaround. That's why I agree with you completely.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.480]   I would like to see the Chrome OS continue adding for an item. In fact, I think Google would be
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.720]   crazy and they seem to agree to kill it because of course they're killing it in education.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.720]   They're just one of the questions that I have about what Lock Shimer said, which is,
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:56.560]   is that just really to preserve another year of sales for Chromebooks? Or is that really Google's
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.320]   strategy? It would be a mistake at this point for Google to say, "Oh yeah, two years, no more
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.960]   Chromebooks," because like you say, this is a big business for them now, especially in schools.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.520]   I could argue it should be. I can argue it both ways. Here's the argument in favor of killing
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:19.040]   Chrome OS. Lately, you may have noticed that Google is really emphasizing the products and services
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:26.400]   that they have that have massive scale. Have they been acquiring things? No. There was a while
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.720]   where they were acquiring a company a week. When was their last acquisition? They're really
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.480]   slowing down on acquisition. This was the lowest year since 2009, I think, for acquisitions.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.760]   Absolutely. They seem to be just really phasing out all the small things and doubling down on the
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.520]   big things. Here they have two operating systems. One is the biggest operating system in the history
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:52.080]   of mankind. The other one's pretty tiny by big operating system standards in terms of numbers.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.720]   There's an argument to be said that says, "Okay, let's just double down on the gigantic one and make
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.600]   it even more gigantic." Here's the argument in the other direction. There's no downside to them
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.320]   getting everybody using the Chrome OS. Chrome plugins. It gets people on the internet. It's very
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:18.800]   secure. It's great for implementing at scale. You can essentially manage a huge number of Chromebooks
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:25.760]   centrally. It's a very appealing solution for lots and lots of people. There's just no reason
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.600]   for them to kill it. They can go ahead and integrate elements of Chrome OS into Android without
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:40.400]   touching. That should have no impact on existing base of Chrome OS users. It's really hard to tell.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.480]   I think they're playing it straight. I think they're going to continue Chrome OS. I don't think
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.960]   that's just wishful thinking on my part. I think they're actually going to keep Chrome OS
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:56.480]   going and definitely keep trying to grow it. Ron, what's weird to me is the Wall Street Journal
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:04.160]   quote is, "We're going to fold Chrome OS into Android," which from a market point of view makes sense.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.640]   You take the little one, you fold into the big one. From a user point of view makes less sense.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:18.480]   I would mind seeing, in fact, I would welcome a Chromebook with the ability to run Android apps.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:25.760]   That's something we know Google's working on publicly. That's in beta. I think this report
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.600]   kind of says that they're going to go in the complete opposite direction. That was Android apps
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.040]   on top of Chrome OS, using Chrome OS as a base. This report says they're going to start using
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.280]   Android as a base. It makes sense, I think, because that's, like Mike said, they want to do the scale
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:49.840]   thing. Android is definitely not a worthy replacement for Chrome OS today. You have to keep in mind
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.960]   that because it's a three to four-year project, you're going to see Android change a whole lot
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:02.640]   in order to take over this PC spot. Chrome OS will stick around, but this is going to put
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:10.800]   Android directly in competition with Chrome OS. I think it'll be a lot like when Microsoft comes
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:19.120]   out with a new version of Windows. Windows 7 and 8 are still for sale today, but so is Windows 10.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.040]   You can go out and buy 7 and 8, but they're not the future. The future for Microsoft is Windows 10,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.080]   and I think when this hybrid OS comes out, you'll be able to get the older stuff, but they won't be
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:38.080]   the future. All the development is going to happen on this new version, which makes total sense.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.640]   I think a big part of it, besides scale, is they want to get Google Play on every device imaginable,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:51.040]   because that's become a core strength of Google, where they have all these developers and all
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:57.200]   these apps and all of these development tools, specifically for Android and the Google Play ecosystem,
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.640]   and Chrome OS does not integrate with any of that at all, really.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:08.400]   I wouldn't. I think the problem is we're thinking of a computer running Android as we know it today.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.600]   I don't think that's really what we're talking about. Certainly, how many Chrome extensions
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.200]   are there? Hundreds, thousands, maybe. How many Android apps are there? A million, including Chrome.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.760]   So if you took a couple of things I really like about Chrome OS, the security of the platform
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.880]   is huge, and it's very different from the security of Android. It's a very different kind of platform.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:38.320]   Yeah, and in fact, I've said much to the chagrin of some Android fans that I think that pretty much
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.400]   Chrome OS is probably the most secure, easily significant operating system, and Android is
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:54.080]   arguably the least. Cambridge study a couple of weeks ago found that 87.7% of Android implementations
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:02.080]   are currently running one of 11 known massive security vulnerabilities. It's a big, big problem,
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:08.320]   and it's associated with the fact that the OEMs that make the phones are in charge of the updates,
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:17.520]   essentially. They range from Google itself for the Nexus phones, which is the best, but not even
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:23.680]   they're not super great compared to say iOS, to who knows, there are a thousand companies that
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:31.360]   make Android phones. Most of them are in China, but the average Android phone is incredibly insecure.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:37.040]   And so I don't know how you marry the two unless you basically have Android apps running on Chrome
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.960]   OS, then you'd have a secure up, but then I don't know what that is. I love that.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.720]   Again, it sounds like that's not what they're or you rebuild Android from the ground up with
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.760]   Chrome in mind. That's what I kind of hope comes out of this is because Google knows,
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:58.080]   obviously everybody knows Google, one of Android's biggest enemies right now is the fractured update
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.440]   system and the state of updates across multiple devices. The way Android is designed right now,
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.080]   that is incredibly difficult to do. And then you bring in the carriers into the whole
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.680]   scene and then it becomes even more complicated. If Google focuses on rebuilding Android from the
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:19.040]   ground up, integrating the things that work for Chrome, which by the way, has an amazing update
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.600]   strategy and they're able to execute on that the way that they should be with Android,
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.800]   then maybe they solve some of the underlying issues in the OS along the way and make it so that
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.920]   aside from any of those other roadblocks and interferences, they can still update things like
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.600]   security and just the OS in general without having to bring other parties into the situation.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:49.120]   So would this future Android be a cloud-only product? That would be really interesting.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.880]   That would be. Hey, Tom.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.560]   I think if you're going to do this big change with Android and Chrome OS, I think,
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.720]   like Jason said, you do take the opportunity to say, let's do this right and let's do a ground up
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:10.560]   rethink of the operating system. I think the thing that would fix the most problems is if they
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:18.640]   define some kind of platform on arm chips like an analog to a PC BIOS where it's like, there's this
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:25.680]   layer of, there's this layer that makes the hardware communicate with the software and it's
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:31.760]   super basic and the hardware maker is right to this and Google will write to this and then
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.280]   everything can talk to everything else, just like the way the PC BIOS works. I mean, on that,
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.640]   you can take Windows and install it on pretty much anything or without an operating system at all,
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:48.080]   you'll still be able to do input and get a picture on there and all that stuff so that you can
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.840]   like install an operating system. Well, and Android is best suited to that because it's running on
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:57.920]   the Java virtual machine, which has already ported to every possible hardware platform.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.200]   Yeah, but I mean, Microsoft did this with Windows Mobile. They kind of defined a platform and said
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:10.240]   everybody has to write for this and arm's kind of making like a BIOS style thing for arm server
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:16.880]   chips and you've got to hope that by the time 2017 rolls around, they've brought this back
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:23.280]   down to phones and everybody can kind of write to that. And then I think the other big problem is
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:29.520]   the ecosystem partners more than anything. And I think when you do this big merge, you say, hey,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.600]   these are the new rules now and this is kind of a new product and we're kind of starting over with
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.360]   with what you guys think you can do. And we need to be in charge of updates now. Google has to say
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.720]   that there were in charge of updates now and and maybe they could make some kind of skin system
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.880]   for OEMs to use that doesn't touch the base operating system. But I really think they need to
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.920]   just rethink things from the ground up because everybody has to do that at some point. We saw
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   Windows do it with XP when they when they dumped Windows 98 or the MS-DOS space like 9x codebase
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:12.480]   for for XP and Apple did it with OS 10 when they switched to a Unix operating system and it's
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.800]   every operating system has to do this at some point. I see the world's biggest Android device.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:24.720]   The Samsung. I detached now this is the this is the other the other this is this is the
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.200]   surface book and I detached the screen so it is more a little bit more like Android it's running
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.880]   the launcher that I use which is nova launcher I maybe doesn't like the vertical orientation
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.920]   oh yeah I guess it was about to do that hold on a second this is running in emulation by the way
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:48.240]   this is oh well no but no no this that's how the AMI I believe that's how the AMI Android works
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.720]   but it's but this is Android I mean it's pop palpably Android you can see the widgets are
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.320]   swamped by the screen size and and so forth you know what it's really great icons are tiny yeah
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.720]   and that's why the pen is really helpful I mean all of that you could fix that's just because this
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.400]   is a pure port of AOSP Android you even have to go out and get the Google services in the apps
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:14.320]   and it's great for his gaming yeah this is awesome especially because game developers have to develop
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.760]   for an environment where you don't know what the resolution is going to be and it could be as
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:24.240]   high as 3000 by 2000 so so that's that's this is developed for that and it actually works
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.280]   fairly well you can see a little hesitation in the in the graphics display but but not not a whole
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:35.680]   lot the sound that's like a 3k screen is very impressive yeah I mean they're they're pushing a
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:42.240]   lot of pixels on here in am as I said in emulation this is not you know going directly to the x86
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:49.040]   architecture by the way ARM versus x86 at the nice thing both Chromebooks and Android can run on
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.400]   both so I don't think that's an issue I wonder if there are issues with AOSP with the open source
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.680]   it certainly would help Google to be able to get away from that right yeah that's that's the
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.560]   problem with updating is that anybody can develop a quote Android version I think you abandoned the
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.840]   Android you might even abandon the Android trademark for that reason I had heard um
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:17.760]   internally the codename for this was Google OS yeah that makes more sense right uh yeah it would
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.160]   it would be cool I mean I don't know if they want to rebrand and lose you know all the cute little
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.360]   Android figures and all that but um I think if you did some kind of rebrand like that you could
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.320]   definitely go to partners and say hey those were the Android rules and these are the Google OS
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:37.760]   rules and the Google OS rules say you don't get to mess with anything and uh and we're gonna do
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.440]   updates because every new Google platform is like that even the new Android platforms are like that
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:50.240]   you know OEMs can't mess with Google TV or uh I mean they can't mess with Android TV or Android
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.600]   Wear or Android Auto all of that the interface is off limits and you've got to run it and just
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:01.440]   build some hardware and you can preload apps on it but that's it okay good that looks I mean that
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:07.040]   looks great yeah um that's pretty impressive and what you're describing Ron of course the OEMs
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:15.120]   don't like that but users do users love vanilla Android tend to yeah I think they they started that
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:23.520]   to spur adoption and at this point uh the the mobile OS duopoly is is so strong that Google could
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.400]   do whatever they wanted and no one can say no to them because there is no alternative it's not
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.400]   like you can go license iOS and if it's not iOS or Android nobody's got to want it like even Blackberry
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.040]   has fallen at this point yeah and uh there there I mentioned that because their phone's coming out
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.880]   next week I think oh yeah the uh PRIV the PRIV yeah that's super what a terrible name it's
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.560]   a PRIV yeah but hey the name is dumb but I'm super excited about it look at this is Google plus
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.320]   looks like Pinterest when you yeah screen that big huh that's that's your standard awful tablet
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:02.000]   interface for Android yeah so it yeah yeah that's the problem right it's not on a big screen you get
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.240]   they nobody's as you said at the very beginning Ron no they even Google doesn't support this
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:12.160]   yeah I mean Android support like you said it supports x86 and ARM so that's good for for PCs
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:17.920]   it supports uh mouse and keyboard and gamepad like you can take USB stuff and plug it into Android
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.040]   and Android will figure it out and work and you'll get a mouse cursor uh it's it's really impressive
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:29.760]   actually um they're just gonna need a whole new interface and all new apps um there's actually a
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:38.160]   thing called remix is it remix OS um that takes Android and kind of turns it into a desktop operating
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:43.680]   system it's a it's a third party project but uh the interface is is interesting it kind of shows
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:51.760]   you what a uh windowed version of Android would look like yeah and that remix OS is at jide.com j-i-d-e
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:58.960]   dot com okay yeah so what if um so what so Chrome OS is this right it's Chrome yeah now this is
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.680]   Chrome running on Android but uh and and you can't do most Chrome extensions on the Android version
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.880]   of Chrome no extensions at all but what if you could uh how would that be significantly different
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:14.480]   I mean in that now you have it I mean you don't really have a windowed uh experience in Android
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.200]   at the moment unless you had a Chrome extension that gave it to you it's supposed to yeah well
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:26.560]   but wasn't windowing in I mean didn't we see it in some code uh oh you're talking about multi-screen
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:32.080]   or it had a beta version of it and they have an implement it right but that was a that was really
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.120]   not appropriate for a mouse and keyboard that was kind of like what's on iOS where you can or
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.400]   or Windows uh the tablet version of Windows you know you can drag apps to the side of the screen
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.520]   and it'll lock to it's split screen it's not windowed there's a big difference right right
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.720]   although that's the new thing by the way is not
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.760]   it's so funny because it brings back the debate that happened in the very earliest days of graphical
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:04.400]   user interfaces should we be tiled or should we be uh overlapping windows and there was really
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:11.120]   battle to the death yeah and uh overlapping windows obviously one yep and I feel like tiled is coming
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:18.480]   back both iOS and the iPad Pro is doing tiled um you're seeing tiled in an OS 10 really if you do
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:25.120]   that and you split screen thing yeah and certainly windows has it with the snap um well well snap will
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:30.320]   see I like snap because of that does or or whatever the thing is on death not overlapping though even
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.520]   though you can resize it it's still not overlapping and that's the key that's tiled versus overlapping
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.400]   i think what's really changed is you can't assume that anybody has a mouse anymore right they
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:45.360]   may have a touchpad right they may not have a touchpad they may be on a touch interface you
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.160]   don't know what people are using but you can't say oh they're gonna have a mouse right uh and I
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.640]   think that's great I think I think the mouse is kind of you know it's from the 60s it's kind of over
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:00.960]   and I think we should move on and and have interfaces that invite touch and voice and things like that
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.760]   hybrid interfaces and I think you know that could be part of what Google's thinking about this ground
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.200]   up uh reorientation you know enough of the icons and the trash cans and that that whole metaphor the
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:19.680]   wimp user interface is 37 six years old something like that um I think I'd like to see uh us just
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:26.000]   completely go entirely into the into the post-PC interface I have to say as bad as this is just
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.240]   because there was no consideration given to a giant screen like this yeah it's still better than
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:36.320]   the touch interface and windows yeah that this that's actually is a kind of a more sensible uh this
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:42.960]   is flip board the android version running on a windows machine um and it actually uh if you if
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:48.720]   you do touch first I think you get some some benefits that you don't get if you take a desktop OS and
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.400]   you add touch uh to it yeah I don't know though if you if you want to get work done you I think
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.960]   you pretty much need a mouse just stuff like text selection is impossible that's why I love
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.840]   the surface book because it's it's it is the best of both worlds so I can reattach this and it
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:09.840]   becomes a mousing operating system and uh I mean I think that's kind of you know I got a trackpad I
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:18.960]   got a um desktop and um I think the flexibility is appealing um and the and the pen and everything
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.600]   can we see a world where where the chrome OS and android combination is something similar to that
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:31.520]   where when you're in device mode you're running an android which is kind of native native to and
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.640]   then you pop it into the keyboard and boom you're in chrome OS isn't that I could imagine like a
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:42.000]   continuum style thing sure but I I don't think it'll be chromos I think it'll just be big android
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.400]   and little android yeah like what you see on an Asus pad phone or whatever but but good right I
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:56.000]   I think one of the more interesting angles is what google will do uh when it has to build it if it
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.560]   does this android on pcs thing it's gonna have to build a bunch of like pc desktop apps and google
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.680]   has never really done that in its history uh they've they've always kind of said oh just go to this
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.080]   website on the internet and and now they're gonna have to have you're gonna have like a desktop
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.840]   version of gmail and a desktop version of google calendar and all this other stuff that's less
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.440]   than ideal isn't it from google's point of view because if you're in the cloud um they have access
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.800]   to all your data I mean don't they want you to be don't they well it'll be just like android it'll
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:32.800]   be just like android where there's an app that that syncs everything to the cloud and it's just
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.240]   because the interface is there and you don't have to have you know browser chrome and all this other
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:43.520]   stuff you it's a lot more powerful uh but unlike mobile google it seems weird to say like google
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:49.600]   might abandon the web but the mobile web where they have mobile apps for a lot of things that's
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:55.360]   absolutely the case like you go to a mobile browser and try to go to gmail or google calendar and
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:02.560]   you'll get like this super old version that's like two or three major redesigns old and some
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.920]   some of these things uh google music and hangouts there's just no mobile website at all and it's
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:14.640]   just like go to the play store and uh you wonder what their internet what their their web selection
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.520]   will be like when they have to make all of these desktop programs do they say like will the desktop
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:28.240]   gmail app be the best version of gmail then hmm i don't know i personally i tend to avoid
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:36.080]   desktop apps i use a number of different devices but my main device is uh is a macbook pro uh and
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:41.760]   you know for stuff like slack and and all the social networks and lots and lots of things that
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:47.360]   have desktop apps for os 10 i just use the browser version i do it all in browser i try not to install
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:53.760]   anything and i just you know they the the chrome os is what made me love that idea i agree and it's
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.880]   just so reassuring to know that no matter what device i go on whatever i was doing i can do it in
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:04.160]   just the same way on the new device i don't think oh i didn't install so and so i come down to how
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:10.480]   smart google is they they're in a great position because they have sent the time frame as to be a
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:17.040]   a couple of years uh and they have the opportunity having learned a lot now from chrome os and from
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.960]   android to and i hope that they do this to do something from the ground up that makes sense in the
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:28.400]   modern context that's the thing that microsoft really couldn't do they did reinvent windows but
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.200]   they can't go from the ground up they've got all this legacy i think oh my apples in the same
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   situation with os 10 and ios they're really i think even at least microsoft was willing to take a
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.840]   chance they're really reluctant at this point they've they've got a problem they know they have a
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.240]   problem yeah because usage is changing and how people think of computing is changing google
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.440]   probably is in the best i would submit what do you think in the best position right now to do this
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.040]   well when you look at what they did with with os 10 and like windows xp it was
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.720]   they didn't abandon their legacy mostly they emulated it right i'm hoping google will be
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:09.760]   willing to do something that's a third thing is what i'm saying and do they think they'll have the
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:16.160]   the guts to do that start from i think start from the say this is what we've learned with android
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.040]   this is what we've learned with chrome os now let's start from the ground up thinking about how
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.680]   usage patterns are going to change over the next ten years to make a modern os boy i'd love to see
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.080]   that oh yeah but but it's still going to be pitched as the new version of android regardless of how
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.680]   much the core changes maybe not because isn't android polluted by the fact that the aosp and the
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:41.520]   and and the name android is used in a non-googled context by people like amazon and and uh cheap
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.960]   handset makers all over the world that's polluted the android name stage fright is polluted the
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:52.480]   android name maybe this is an opportunity to something i i would expect google to say yes we're gonna
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:58.720]   rebrand but not just a rebrand yeah we're going to maintain aosp the open source android handset
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:05.120]   and we've got this new operating system that we control that we update that works on all your
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:10.000]   devices and works has in the modern way like you like to work the question of course is will
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.880]   consumers trust google to do an os you know the other thing is the google google just doesn't have
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:23.200]   the fascist sensibility that apple does uh apple says here's the thing you're all going to do it
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.520]   our way and if you don't do it our way nothing is going to happen google is like well you could
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.800]   do this way you could do that way here's another app here's that you know it's like and you and
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.320]   but it creates a certain level of confusion for the mass market so i think that if they strongly
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:42.880]   differentiate the fascist google version of android versus the open source version that would be good
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.960]   because you know if it's a premium os i mean look what they're doing with android one
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:53.280]   they're already in india they're already loosening the restrictions on what's required for you to
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.840]   use it if you're in oe in india because they really want adoption they really want people buying
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:03.520]   into the android one platform and if these uh if the handset makers want to dumb down the specs
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.160]   or whatever to make it cheaper google is now saying yeah go go ahead you know if that's an
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:13.680]   indication of where they're thinking yeah we'll go ahead and allow there to be crappy android
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.560]   phones out in the world but meanwhile we've got mostly one no choice the ones that we touch are
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.960]   like awesome right if that's if that's the general direction i think that would be fine you know what
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.760]   i think you could make the case and i bet you have uh jason howlin all about android that
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:34.960]   that really there is now only one good android phone it's nexus and uh everybody else should just
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.720]   get out of the i'm sure google wouldn't say this out loud but i think this is the message
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:44.000]   you've said this ron haven't you just this is the end this is it this is the only this is the
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.240]   android handset definitely yeah i mean from a consumer perspective sure you you know
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:56.320]   nexus devices are half the price of everything else and in the past that's come with uh big
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:01.920]   compromises but the newest ones are are great and they nail pretty much everything you'd want
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:07.280]   on a checklist in to look at sam's song or htc or lg yeah there really isn't but i mean google
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:13.200]   just released released information that sam's songs touch whiz interface added what how many
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:21.200]   13 new exploits yeah nice job sam's song this oem software doesn't it doesn't add anything positive
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:26.240]   like it slows down your updates and security gets bad and and it's it's uglier and you just
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:32.000]   don't want it you just want to stay as far away from that crap as you can this is i think the release
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:39.520]   of this information is no at the same time as uh as nexus phones hit the market is no uh is no
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:45.120]   accident um i think you're seeing more and more from google saying don't buy those other android
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:51.120]   devices you know and and and look at the business side of it apple by itself makes 92% of the profit
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:56.400]   smartphone industry because they control it all they make money on the hardware they make money on
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.840]   services they make money on you know picking up a third of of all the app revenue and so that's
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:08.400]   really the model that's turns you into a incredibly not that google's one thing is
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.000]   models different right there their model is not to sell more phones their models to get you to use
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.240]   google services everywhere as much as possible but but the but the apple model is even more
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.160]   compelling yes you make money on the services yes you make money on the advertising yes you make
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.600]   money on the licensing and guess what you can also make money on the hardware you can make money
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:28.880]   on the city this is the argument people had of apple versus microsoft yeah would you rather be
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.600]   the software company the licenses software or the hardware company that makes hardware and for
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.280]   years it was you'd rather be bill gates and then all of a sudden right i think you'd rather be apple
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.960]   and look what microsoft is doing now yeah they're moving out in the apple way it's uh we live in
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:52.720]   interesting times uh and i guess what i'm saying is i hope there's somebody super smart who's sitting
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:58.320]   down and thinking about well how are computers what is a computer gonna even mean in the next
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:04.400]   decade maybe that's too long a time frame well did you guys see the the tweet from uh Matias Duarte
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:10.480]   google's uh vp of design um he was uh he was going to town on windows 10 saying it looks just like
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.640]   windows XP did from 10 years ago on twitter it's so it i thought that was interesting where it's
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:22.080]   like at the same time where this google pc operating system news comes out you know their their head
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:28.000]   designer is like is bashing windows on twitter and and talking about how old it is well in fact
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.960]   that's exactly what microsoft i think uh did at the behest of its users they went back and said yeah
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:42.320]   we went too far too fast with windows 8.1 we're going back a little bit i'm looking he's he tweets
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:47.520]   a lot this guy on the other hand look at how Matias Duarte dresses look at that coat yeah
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.880]   let's keep going keep there we go i have no beef with that windows 10 looks i'm disappointed
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:59.600]   it works just like xp understand that's a feature for many which it is it's microsoft selling point
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:07.920]   yep uh so this is the original tweet yeah they went back to the old school ls but when you think about
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.280]   the computer of the future for lack of a better term i think google's in a great position because
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:19.520]   they uh they focus on the cloud the computer of the future is everything your house is the computer
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.120]   right every every screen's everywhere devices everywhere some device with no
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:28.320]   screens internet functions about the form factor at all and it's in the cloud google now will become
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:34.960]   will grow and grow and grow and become this ever present uh interface to do that exactly and
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.400]   so google's in a great position they really need to continue to be radical uh in going into the
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.560]   cloud getting people that's why i mean that's why you should be agnostic about hardware not even
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.880]   getting maybe not even getting the hardware business yeah and that was the traditional google model
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.600]   wasn't it yep uh we don't care what you use as long as you use more google we're happy well but
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.920]   but on the other hand we're talking about alpha bet now so they've got their you know we have a
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.080]   hardware under google they have nasa but then they also have other potential businesses they could
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:10.160]   launch to make hardware including well cars jason howl is very kindly given me not forever just for

[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:37.440]   as we see the reports Andy Inako has been taking pictures with his six p if you go to flicker.com/andii
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:44.800]   i have to say this camera is amazing yep yep great results and you you're on the five x it's
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.800]   the same camera so you're not missing anything on that i love dandy's comments on that he basically
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:56.000]   went straight to to the point and pointed out that the bottom line is you can't see any any
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:03.920]   superiority between either the six p or the iPhone i think now pictures i think and we talked
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:09.680]   about this a mak break yesterday i i really feel like at this point if you get any of the top of
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:16.320]   the line phones you're gonna get a really good camera yeah that's no longer the issue you know
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:22.640]   but but those phones are all seven to eight and nine hundred dollars where these are this is
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:29.680]   five hundred yeah oh it feels like an eight hundred dollar phone yeah that is nice this is you got the
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.560]   aluminum you know what i'm jealous i think that was a smart move i've had black phones i've had
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.880]   white phones this was my opportunity to get an aluminum phone it's like okay i'll get an aluminum
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.120]   and then and then the periscope really looks more like a periscope on the aluminum one yeah
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:49.440]   all ahead full so people know you have six p from across the room yeah yeah that's pretty
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.000]   and if you if you want to get really fancy with the uh with the camera stuff you can install a
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.400]   third-party app and do uh raw photos oh which which one are you using is fv is that the one that
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:09.120]   everybody uses for raw uh fv fv five yeah they have a both audio both stills and video and they
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:14.480]   have more settings than you know it's amazing yep yeah every every setting known to man and you
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.960]   can stick it in you know snap seat or lightroom or whatever and tweak all your settings afterwards
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.640]   it's really fun right i do use snap seat i have to say it's an amazing yeah there you go that is a
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:31.600]   gorgeous screen yeah that's nice oh my goodness gracious golly yeah sure you betcha that's a
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:37.760]   beautiful phone there you got there jesus okay then thank you and if you don't like the the nuclear
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:45.520]   amoled colors you can go to the developer options and there's a fun little it's it's it's sRGB the
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:50.720]   the little checkbox and you flip it and it'll look uh closer to lcd colors which is really fun
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:56.320]   you're a good yeah yeah it's it's really neat and it should just be in display like it's not
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:00.240]   something that they could hot they need to hide in developer options behind economy code and
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:06.080]   everything else uh that is a shame but uh thanks to ron uh we know how to do that do you is that how
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:12.400]   you run your your phone Jason is in no actually i actually like gold a little bit of that it
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:18.560]   that i'll let uh color like showroom dynamic television you know it's very cool right yeah i mean
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.880]   that's why sam song does it because a lot of a lot of people just like it they like how how bright
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:27.520]   and poppy and vibrant the colors are you know you might think this is nutty but what i'm actually
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:34.480]   trying to find is what is the wattage of the adapter because of course this is a type c
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:40.160]   connector and uh and it's fast charging everybody's raved about the speed of charging
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.360]   and what i'd like to know it i mean it's not quick charge so it's not anything special
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.880]   you just need to have the right wattage in the adapter and i'd like to know what the stock
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:56.560]   adapters wattage is i'd also love to know what the maximum you could push out is yeah it's it's uh
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:01.360]   it's usb type c quick charging which is supposed to be like some weird new standard that they're
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:06.560]   gonna have all right but uh probably the that's the weirdest thing about owning that phone is that it's
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:11.200]   that it's usb type c so you need to go and like invest in in cables and if you're if you're at a
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:16.000]   friend's house and your phone is dead you're not charging it that's gonna change though you got to
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.040]   take a picture of the of the small fine print on that on that charger and oh that's what i'll do yeah
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:26.560]   yeah yeah that's what i'll do there you go i can use my phone as a magnifier i'll have to go i don't
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:33.680]   want to i don't want to ruin Jason's uh see i'm using f uh v five or whatever on this all right
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.920]   if you don't want to ruin Jason's phone i will i mean somebody's got no no no i already tried to
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:46.320]   bend the thing focus on the worst how do i get that nice and steady then i can blow it up right
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:51.440]   adventures in dealing with fine print all right there we go i got it took a picture
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:58.080]   now and you blow it up and it says if you can read this you're too close now the problem with
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.120]   this this really crazy camera apathy it's just crazy wait a minute i didn't want to do that
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:13.760]   there we go today no not that one that's so that's one of those uh one of those crazy shots
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:22.160]   it was crazy uh oh come on oh there you go there it is yeah oh come on man all right
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:28.880]   oh it's gonna be too dark to well maybe not look at that wow you get a snap seat and up wow
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:36.720]   let's see it says right there it is five by three it's 15 watt is that right no
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:43.680]   yeah that is a 15 watt adapter that's bigger than the iPad adapter you probably can't see that but
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:51.200]   i can't wow yeah that sounds right it's it's 15 watts five volt three amps yeah this says okay
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.880]   wow that's a very so that's good to know so that means if you want to get maximal speed and
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:02.000]   charging you're going to want to get a 15 watt adapter if you need more than just this one uh
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.920]   that's it that's amazing so that's why it charges so fast that's pushing a lot out there
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:16.480]   um so that's usb c to usb c is capable of three amps yeah the the six p comes with a type
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:21.680]   c to type c cable and a type a to type c cable which you absolutely need like like i ran out and
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:27.120]   bought a ton of of type a to type c cable i did too but see i had the pixel and i had the macbook so
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:33.600]   i have been on mono price i've been to the mountaintop i have seen the type c connectors and i have
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:43.120]   every possible type c connector so congratulations Jason it's a six p yeah and uh it can actually
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.720]   charge other phones by the way no that's that's not a good use of your
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:54.240]   you know i have to actually try that i don't know it's pretty slow but i i did it it was like it was
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:59.280]   like microscopic amount of power i'll do that uh it's capable of it that's that's the
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:04.320]   k-point i guess um so what i have to decide i'm getting it tomorrow right before i leave to go
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:11.600]   to my son's father's son frat weekend and i'm trying to just i'm trying to decide and you can help me
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:16.000]   guys am i gonna get enough battery life should i bring my iphone which i know can get through the
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:23.840]   day without any problem at all or should i take a chance and bring my six my brand new shiny new six
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:30.800]   p what's the battery life like uh i understand that it's it's uh it's supposed to be good
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:36.560]   it's on the good side of average that's not good enough i want it's an android phone damn it
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:42.240]   even with doves and all the new things in marshmallow i can't uh i want to know with this uh father
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:48.560]   son frat party as you how's your how's your beer pong game uh no we're playing something called snappa
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:53.680]   you remember that no ronnie you're a young fella did you play that in college snappa
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:58.400]   now apparently it's very popular in the frat i thought it was gonna be beer pong too yeah and then
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:06.240]   they said beer die and i thought i hope they mean dice or or yeah or food coloring not not uh wake
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:14.800]   up then i just got the itinerary today and it said uh get this so we're doing uh we're doing father's
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:21.280]   son snappa tournament i don't know what that is and then i know that there's a significant beer
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:27.920]   consumption involved in the next day we're going ski shooting it seems like it could go on yeah
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:35.520]   what could go wrong anyway yeah that's uh okay here's snappa apparently oh that looks like it's
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:44.400]   that looks exactly like see you bolder baby right there oh there's dice involved apparently there's
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:50.560]   all sorts of it's a fairly arcane i see beer that's yeah there's a ping pong table yeah i have seen
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:58.240]   them play this actually i i was bewildered by the rights of the natives oh my god is this what you
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:02.640]   play when you're like too good for beer pong like currently this is the next generation when you're
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:09.200]   too drunk for beer pong the kids today i'll tell you see you bolder has a has is one of the last
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:15.760]   schools with a very rich fraternity uh and you're going to be struggling against altitude sickness
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:22.320]   as well that'll be great uh i can't wait but at least my six p will be well it's also and i don't
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.120]   know it's google phy so it would be sprint slash t mobile so i don't even know if that i should
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:33.840]   probably be a phone too yeah just in case yeah grant land bye bye what a shock espn
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:41.920]   maybe not a shock espn had done some layoffs last week um several hundred i think laid off because
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:47.440]   they said we're not it's not that we're doing badly but we've got to kind of align our costs
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:54.560]   given how much the nfl and other game rights cost it's gotten so expensive and yet if you're espn
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.120]   you don't really have much choice you have to get as many football and baseball games as you can
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:06.720]   uh well then the next casualty of this is grant land which i'm even amazed that they they did it
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:13.280]   was as much a culture site as a sports site headed by bill simmons who they fired in the spring
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:18.960]   so i probably should have seen this coming but a good article by ben tomsen and stratecary
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:25.360]   um in fact we're going to get ben on twit on sunday to talk about this he says conventional wisdom
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:31.520]   uh is that uh both are worst off for having split espn for having lost
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:38.800]   simmons and uh in the end a truly remarkable online magazine simmons lost access to espn's
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:45.440]   massive audience he quotes dead spin saying that grant land had six million unique visitors in
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:51.840]   march i don't know about ours technica but uh six million it's kind of low isn't it is that
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:59.440]   low especially for 50 writers 50 writers yeah 50 writers editors and back end staff
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:05.360]   actually i think we have more than six billion not to the website but downloads i think it's seven
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:11.680]   million um even if grant land rights ben had been much more aggressive in monetizing through
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:17.920]   advertisements the site was not by the way it was beautiful it was exactly the kind of site those of
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:24.080]   us who use ad blockers would like which is uh you know basically one banner ad plus you might be
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:34.000]   interested in block at the bottom um it was uh um there's no question that grant land was an
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.880]   editorial success he says in terms of quality i'd agree with that i read it a lot and i'm not even
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:44.640]   a sports fan site get it got three national magazine award nominations a prime time emmy
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:50.720]   which must be hard for a website yeah and was nominated for one of the number of sports
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:56.240]   emmys webby awards and epsio epi awards and more um ben was a fan
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:08.320]   but um that i think i think the issue is scale he quotes uh tod van derworf
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:13.920]   writing on vox the promise scale a larger general interest site can't be built purely
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:20.720]   a top long form because long form takes time both for writers to write and readers to read
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:28.560]   therefore as both buzzfeed and gocker realized early on well done long form could be the stake
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:38.080]   but couldn't be the meal they needed quick hitting fast you know link generating articles
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.640]   um so the question is and here's his famous
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.680]   ben's famous for his illustrations
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:55.280]   where he kind of finds the sweet part in the curve between uh you know massive
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:01.760]   conte discovery uh with google facebook and twitter and highly expensive but
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:11.760]   smaller value content creation um this is this is the bottom line this was his tweet
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:19.680]   writing is really about lead generation hmm that's sad isn't this a writer i'm sure i see you
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:28.080]   shaking your head i'm sure ron has also as well um i think one of the one of the big deals about
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:36.080]   ours technica is how kind of slim we roll in terms of people like 50 people is insane to me
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.000]   like you know we have meetings and everybody fits into you know like a medium-sized meeting
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.600]   room like that's a lot of these places that closed down recently when you hear about how many
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:51.760]   writers they had hired it's crazy and it's like i don't know how fast you want your home page to
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:56.240]   like scroll with new stories yeah when you have 50 people like what what is your plan what is
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:03.920]   their output a month and we won't mention giga home by name yeah yeah um so simmons has gone on to
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:12.240]   do two things when he's doing a tv show for hbo and the other is a podcast apparently grandlands
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:17.120]   podcast were really good i never listened to one but that's part of the problem with podcasts
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:23.920]   well i i didn't listen because i i don't like sports but Ben writes the trouble with podcasts
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:28.000]   they're difficult to grow while text can be shared and consumed quickly and this is something we face
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.040]   uh podcast requires a commitment which is why advertising is so valuable in podcasts if you've
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:41.200]   made that commitment uh you're engaged in those ads work better um simmons though by virtue of
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:46.560]   his previous writing and this is the writing his lead generation is averaging 400 000 downloads
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.880]   per episode i can tell you from our experience that's astounding yeah that's huge number
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:56.960]   although i always look uh and i would caution everybody to do this with a grain of salt
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:03.120]   at podcast numbers because there's no accepted way of measuring that yeah and so i know what our
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:08.960]   numbers are which is at best half that but we now measure numbers in a much more uh conservative
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.680]   way than most people most people just look at the number of downloads and if we use that number
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:19.440]   it would be over 400 000 downloads in episode even for this show but that's not an accurate way to
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:28.800]   measure so i don't i don't know what that number means um podcast rates are hard to come by sis Ben
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:33.360]   i'll tell him on sunday a little bit more about this but i'm aware of a few podcasts a quarter the
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:39.440]   size that are earning somewhere in excess of ten thousand dollars per episode that's very low
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.960]   yeah for us uh presuming proportionally similar rates the bill cements podcast which
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:50.160]   publishes three times a week could be on a six million dollar run rate that's probably correct yeah
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:54.800]   which per my envelope math could nearly pay for a 15 person staff all our grant land
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:04.480]   so in other words uh he's found a more efficient way to monetize but writing was the great lead
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:10.480]   generator for an actual monetizable business and that's the lesson interesting i'm not sure it's
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:16.640]   right but that's the lesson that uh Ben pulls from the failure of grant land the failure of grant
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:21.920]   land that led to he says the success of bill sims as a brand i think that's accurate i think that
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.320]   the model that they that would have worked for them is the buzzfeed model where you have
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:32.320]   you have clickbait and you have long form you know quality journalism exactly what he says
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:39.120]   over extend yourself with as ron says with the with the staff keep it lean keep it mean and and
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:43.680]   take it from both ends and long form in the very short form he says the website should have been
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:48.400]   grant land should have been step one to a multimedia endeavor that converted visitors to fans
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:53.840]   willing to invest in time and formats that can actually pay the bills yep not just podcasts i
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:59.280]   think that may not be the right answer but i think you're right buzzfeed and vice both right have
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:07.360]   mastered that model yep on the other hand that's sad because um it kind of deprecates long form
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:12.080]   writing the stuff we really appreciate well you know people human beings will tell you they want
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.960]   long form high quality content but in actual practice there's so much content out there that
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:22.240]   people just skim and they they you know they brush over things so you want to do long form content
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:27.840]   because it's it's uh it's the right thing to do you you get you can do original journalism
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.600]   if you don't do original journalism you're just a pickup site and you shouldn't even exist
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:37.280]   um but at the same time you you you need both and and i think one of the challenges of podcasting
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:42.080]   is that unlike article if i if i you know if something's viral on twitter and it has a
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:46.080]   devastating headlines a fascinating thing you know people go in and read an article
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:50.720]   and they don't care that they don't always read that particular writer or that particular
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:56.000]   publication they read that article right just just on its own whereas podcasting people tend to think
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.360]   okay well i'm either subscribing to it or i'm not listening to it at all right right and and
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:05.600]   and people tend to listen to their podcast serially so you you try to get subscriptions but how do
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:10.560]   you get people to subscribe if they don't sample the goods which people you know that's where the
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:16.720]   writing is usually form is useful exactly so one of the things i i really like that uh the
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:22.240]   twit does is you'll like cut out the the good stuff you would have to throw it up on on youtube yeah
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:27.200]   it's like a little a little tiny thing like that uh when you got the note pen stuck in the
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:33.040]   yeah that was viral thanks to you yeah yeah that what that got like a ton of views and that was a
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:37.360]   cool if you had never seen the show before that was like a cool introduction to it and kind of a
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:44.240]   fun moment it was like lead generation yeah yeah yeah so i think actually ben's ben's pretty accurate
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:49.200]   in a way that's that's kind of what we do certainly you right i don't write but you right
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:56.560]   uh but everybody here has has built a fan base outside of podcasting right and then we bring on
[00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:03.440]   writers uh people with their own fan base like ron um you know a lot of twit is made up of that
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.960]   right is people like you like jeff javis who have their own fan base that we use to
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:14.560]   lead generate i guess is i mean that seems like a scummy well i know it works both ways you know
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:20.320]   people that that watch twit get to see you know guests come on and and you know see articles and
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.440]   and stuff like that so it's cool yeah thank you really it's there's the big issue in the broader
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:31.680]   large larger issues discovery right um and i as a user i've always felt this way with the internet
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.480]   there's too much great stuff on it yep and i can't figure out how to find it i know i'm missing
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:41.600]   good stuff and eventually you just give up and say well right i hope i get some of it i'm exhausted
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:47.360]   i'm going to bed now i'm gonna stop looking for content why else do we sleep so poorly we we we're
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.640]   we're constantly scanning the internet at three in the morning right yep we are somebody's ringing
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.960]   your door yeah i know it's just i like that ring video doorbell that ring really
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.200]   other actually my wife is schlepping in grocery so every time she walks by the door you see the door
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:08.160]   it's like another bag of groceries um discovery is a big challenge and uh you know i i'm watching
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.240]   the world series and all you see is these ads and they're not for twitter and they're not twitter
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:19.600]   really not really twitter ads yeah they're twitter moments ads because twitter realizes that twitter
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:27.440]   has no value at all unless you spend some time creating a twitter feed that's of use so they created
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.240]   this new moments page which is has nothing to do with who you follow it's just kind of news feed
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:38.160]   and then they spend i must be millions of dollars on world series ads and other and another big
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:45.440]   uh i think it was on blood and oil uh big big tv show ads millions of dollars to get people not
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.760]   to go to the twitter homepage but to go to the moments and i think moments for me personally i
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:56.160]   think is a huge failure i agree i go i keep thinking i i surely there's got to be something good there
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.520]   and every single time i don't find anything compelling that's that's there it just seems like
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:06.160]   it's just it's basically random it's yeah even flip boards better because at least it's tied on my
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:12.080]   twitter feed this is not tied to anything it's just what some editor yeah at twitter thinks is
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.840]   this is like a bad newspaper it's usa today for the web yeah it's like any other website but twitter's
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:23.360]   running it right but it's it's just any other news website on there right you know and speaking
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:29.200]   of this there's a really cool app that i'm gonna go go ahead and recommend it's called t l uh
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:35.280]   t l semicolon dr of course too long didn't read and it's a good name for an F yeah and their story
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.920]   selection is what moments should be it's really surfacing they're surfacing really interesting
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.560]   content and i have a setup i've actually got it set up as a notification on my phone and i
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:49.920]   don't get irritated by it i actually want these notifications that's not an easy so there's an
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:55.600]   email app called t l dr that's not it uh first problem they've got is that there's another app
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:01.040]   with the same name yeah and not to mention it's a very common yes thing that everybody uses when
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:06.720]   they write on the internet yeah well there you go yeah but but anyway this you know part of part of
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:12.000]   the i guess what i'm saying is that twitter's problem with moments is that they're they're
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.600]   they're it's bad editorially it's not that concept is bad it's just that they're failing as an
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.760]   editorial how do you feel about apples news i feel the same way about news that it doesn't do
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.240]   what i want it to do i don't use apple news either i mean it's you're talking about the apples news app
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.680]   yeah that doesn't it sucks at least that supposedly is driven by my interests you agree ron i mean
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:39.840]   you probably my my exposure to apple news has been uh complaining from the people here about how
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:45.680]   many hoops they have to jump through to make it work uh but i haven't really tried it now here is tldr
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:54.080]   it's tldr.io yeah uh so it's a chrome extension and there's also an ios app i don't actually and um i
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.240]   thought it had an android app but it apparently doesn't do too many tabs open remembering too little
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.200]   too much to read and that may be yet another thing i i don't know if that's look it's sponsored by
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:11.280]   giggle yeah and the rude baguette you know but the thing that the thing that bugs me about so much
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:17.280]   of what twitter is doing these days is that they don't seem to appreciate twitter so twitter is
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:24.720]   a thing it's minimalist it's it's not algorithmically sorted it's linear it's based on who you followed
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:30.800]   and those are the qualities that that make me like twitter right a lot and they just have this
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.360]   facebook envy where they're they're they're flirting with algorithmic sorting yeah that inserting stuff
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.560]   i from people i didn't follow but that's because if you come to twitter as a normal person this is
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.280]   why twitter growth is now just at what is it yeah well a million last last month yeah uh you come to
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:50.800]   twitter as a normal person is it's befuddling mm-hmm it took me forever to get used to twitter and i'm
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:56.800]   definitely not a normal person like i i probably tried and quit about three times yeah uh before
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:02.000]   just kind of every other journalist on earth using it forced me to finally sit down and try to make
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.080]   myself use it yeah but it's yeah it's very confusing it's hard to figure out why you would need this
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.080]   like like most of the time when you described twitter to someone they're like why why would i need that
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:17.760]   and it's but it's a it's a source for me it's a source of breaking news yes and kind of comments
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:22.080]   and nothing else and a lot of people don't care about breaking news they're happy to read about it
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:28.560]   like newspaper style like tomorrow on whatever your your website is but for for people like us
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.280]   where where we need to see the new thing it's useful but not normal people how do we solve this i mean
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:41.520]   this really is the discovery issue right uh you know how do we want to we don't want to miss
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:47.200]   everything we don't want to see everything right is it curation is that the key because that's
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:53.120]   kind of what moments is that's kind of what everybody does that for twitter you know yeah
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:58.880]   so many tweets are the source of news stories now that that's everybody on earth does twitter
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:06.000]   curation and i think normal people don't need that level of speed or noise that that twitter gets
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.320]   you like twitter is is the crap that uh that curators have to dig through to find the good
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.560]   stuff but i don't think normal people need to get involved in that or want to get involved in it
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:22.960]   oh this is too weird so i've installed tldr and now as i read websites is it going to shorten
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:28.720]   yeah it shrinks your stuff and does it i should totally try it on one of my articles see how bad
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:34.160]   it is i can't imagine and it's a human doing that so i don't have any tldrs on here
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.480]   is there a human doing that they say it's human oh you may you have to press this button
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:47.200]   options let me see the options uh don't check the existence of tldr for some sites
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.480]   no it says powered by liquid helium the plug-in analyzes the content and creates
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.680]   summarized versions so it's some computer generated it's computer generated
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:02.400]   oh lord that sounds terrible if we're talking about the same too long didn't read
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.960]   yeah but i don't see they they specifically
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.240]   signet sing the loud hacker news it's a picture of a sloth or panda or some kind of furry creature
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:18.960]   are we talking about the same tldr.io i don't see it sloth oh okay oh here we go here's some
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:26.640]   here's some short and sweet yeah i mean already i their suspect um let's go and look in tech news
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:32.320]   right because that's what we do and we know a little bit about this um oh okay you don't have
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:36.080]   to install anything no you can well you think you do to i don't know because i didn't see
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:41.360]   anything like this until i well i don't see any of my articles so obviously this is crap yeah
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:50.560]   uh you know what i have to say it is uh given what oh there's bullet points for everything that's
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:56.000]   key yeah i know this is you know i hate to say it because it sounds horribly antiquated but
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:03.840]   RSS is really awesome i wish our ses would come would revive i still use it i use feely and what i
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:09.040]   do is every time i find an awesome source of news and of course you stumble across things
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:15.920]   i just throw it in there and i i must have i i'm scared even no 400 news sources or something yeah
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:21.760]   and it's it's in reverse chronological order i i can scroll through it quickly i can save things
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.560]   to insta paper and and so that sort of thing you know one of the problems i think we have with
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:32.720]   content discovery is that we discard good ones right oh while we're chasing the shiny new thing and
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.360]   then later we realize oh the shiny new miss our us look at this this surface to a whole bunch of
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:43.440]   art compare that to tldr this is the top front page of my feedly nexus 6p bends easily again here's a
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:48.160]   list of usb type c cables google's lead engineer recommends because they're not all make may equal
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:53.440]   motor roll is opening a retail shop in chicago the nexus 6p features a double tap to wake feature
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:58.880]   hidden in the kernel and these are all art if these are this is good yeah yep but of course as you
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:04.080]   say we had you and i had to do the hard work of putting together hundreds of sources but well
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:09.360]   there's you can uh they have pre-made packages and you can just subscribe to like technology and
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:13.600]   it will give you a bunch of of things but yeah that's like one of my favorite views where you can
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:19.440]   just look at titles and just blow through your your list of of feeds and see what happened but
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:25.280]   this raises what i think is a central confusion around content discovery it's not about discovering
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:31.360]   new sources of content it's about hanging on to the sources of content that you discover and the
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.160]   tools that you've discovered yeah it's like the problem is we forget about great sources of content
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.120]   that we've already discovered and if you can figure out a central place to retain them we
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.440]   discover new source content all the time people refer to them here and there meet you know they're
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:51.840]   everywhere but the trick is to not forget about them well and frankly podcasting is based on RSS
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.200]   so yeah i don't know what we would do without it i mean that's another great thing about about
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:02.560]   RSS is you can it's it's agnostic about the source of content for your podcast in there throw your
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:09.680]   right publication and it's you know it's all presented in a very readable uh format i'm a huge fan of
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:15.520]   RSS and i think google screwed up royally by canceling reader psi i know that's an old gripe
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:22.000]   but i think some kind of some kind of new RSS interface would do pretty well i mean feedly is
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.720]   kind of there when like you go to titles and it shows you uh how many people read each article
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:34.640]   which lets you like really quickly uh see what news is important or popular and what people have
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:41.120]   read and that's made me read articles that i normally would never click on but but i see because
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:45.360]   they're oh everybody else thinks this is a big deal or everybody else thinks this is really funny
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:51.120]   or whatever uh it's definitely maybe click on it and if you were to do something that kind of took
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:57.840]   all those popular stories like feedley has access to everybody's RSS feeds if they were just like
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:04.720]   here's the most popular articles in the world uh you know in these categories that would be i
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:12.320]   think a really neat thing where it would be like crowdsourced uh you know crowdsourced like deciding
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:20.000]   what what stories are good yeah well here's a story i just found it feedly zach hall writing
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.080]   in nine to five google facebook supposedly will be launching its notify news app next week
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.520]   everybody wants to get into this business probably facebook's app is it's with partners right so
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:37.680]   what determines what gets in the news app is whoever gave facebook the most money i would oh
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.560]   whoever signs up for instan articles yeah i guess so the app will be called notify actually this
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.800]   comes from the financial time so let's go to the uh oh i was going to say let's go to the original
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:52.400]   article but it's got a firewall in front of it but here's the secret if you search google for the
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:59.680]   headline you just google the headline you guys already know all that huh wow you're good uh huh
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:06.400]   or i'll just read nine to five google synopsis of it uh media partners include cbs the washing
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:11.360]   and post and vogue well thank god because i am looking for a better way to find great articles
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:17.120]   and vogue right i am looking for that they have articles and vogue so hey hey that's uh that's uh
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.440]   one of my sister it's a condien asked publication a fine i think so right probably there's so much
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:28.160]   fine conda hey i read in the york and and wired so i think we're covered here okay
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:34.880]   how does conda treat you are you kind of autonomous at ours or yes you just uh
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:40.720]   can can fisher the the guy that runs ours the founder does a an excellent job of kind of insulating us
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:46.480]   from from the mothership yeah and uh we we get to do pretty much whatever we want so it's cool plus
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:52.400]   nobody understands you yes right because we're this weird website and everybody else is like the
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:58.080]   what internet does that what kind of what kind of paper does that get printed on and it's like no
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:06.080]   we don't have a magazine no never did um yeah it reminds me of bill gains when mad magazine was sold
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:12.080]   to time Warner bill gains the founder of mad magazine who was quite the character yeah just made
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:18.000]   sure that they did not to have anything to do with mad at all and and was kerf you know
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:27.120]   kentankerous and just you know he kept time at arm's length yeah and until he died mad magazine
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:33.200]   preserved its integrity of course as soon as he passed away mad magazine got co-opted and yeah
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.000]   suddenly they've got ads and all sorts of things so you're lucky to have like that feel like you
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.160]   heard the latest dead journalism empire national geographic oh my god this makes me cry Rupert
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:51.360]   Murdoch yeah bought national geographic and today how many layoffs 200 everybody everybody
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:58.240]   everybody was yeah that's what I saw oh my god so obviously this says this is a developing story
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:04.560]   uh because the first story I saw it was this it was a percentage it's the biggest layoff no no
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.760]   it's not everybody it's the biggest layoff in their history it's 180 out of 2000 oh okay calm
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:16.160]   down calm down unless unless this unless something else has happened uh it's a cost cutting move but
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:21.920]   it is the largest layoff in national geographic uh history it'll it'll also affect people at the
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:27.840]   national geographic channel which is the most profitable part that's everybody knows da da da da da
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:34.000]   right that's uh that's have been a very successful thing for them the national geographic uh tv
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:43.120]   stuff is nine percent in involuntary separations will make up about nine percent and the rest are
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:53.040]   buyouts um wait so how many then 180 okay that's also what pirates used to call people walking
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:59.280]   the plank yeah it's a very separate made it sound like national geographic was dead and everybody was
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.120]   well it may be i mean i can't imagine Rupert Murdoch is going to preserve the
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:09.120]   yes see yeah here's the story i saw that you probably saw Rupert Murdoch lays off
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:15.760]   national geographic staff yes right that makes it sound like everybody on earth got yeah reverb
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:23.120]   yeah right that's what i was reading yeah uh so wow the memo went out November 3rd came to the
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:28.640]   national geographic office this was the day in which Rupert Murdoch's so it happened on November 3rd
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:34.000]   the 20th century fox took over national geographic the management of national geographic sent on the
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.760]   email telling its staff all of its staff to report to their headquarters and wait by their phone so
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:45.280]   that's the email you don't want to get everyone who is in the field every photographer every reporter
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:54.240]   even those on vacation i don't i think this is because the washington post said it was 180 people
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.760]   well this has a hundred nadie employees received involuntary separation
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:05.920]   playoffs while some other staff members were offered consideration of voluntary buyout so that's
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:11.120]   150 people were forcefully fired and some other people were like will you please leave i guess
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:17.920]   not and yeah i think that it's it's not i think that that article
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:23.680]   is overstating it because as everything else i've read says around nine percent layoffs
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:31.360]   but anyway it's sad and scary and and well it's a begin i would say the beginning of the end right
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:37.040]   i i can't imagine i mean the wall street journal does okay they're they're a murdock enterprise
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.360]   uh and they're you know they were good before and they're still good now they they break tons of
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.680]   google news you know we were just talking about them earlier uh so i don't know maybe they're just
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:51.040]   doing super cost cutting or something they laid off their photographic editor sherry brook bocker
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:56.320]   that's yeah that seems like a big deal it's like a big deal that's like what national geographic is
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.680]   is most known for is there awesome pictures uh their picture editor was also laid off geez
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.280]   hovered yeah this doesn't sound good
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:14.880]   yeah well we kind of knew this was going to happen and of course the financial times which
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:19.680]   whose story i was trying to read behind the paywall it's also a murdock
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:29.600]   the future of news is facebook facebook notify uh which is an app which supposedly would come out
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:39.200]   tomorrow um i you know if you'll apple news um this twitter moments i imagine this will be very
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:44.720]   similar i just feel like these are this is not what i'm looking for feedley is what i'm looking for
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.680]   i don't know but what about you at home uh what are you looking for are you looking for some
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:57.040]   you know glossy thing that uh come i feel like this has already failed remember what was what
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:02.320]   was what was the murdock uh effort uh that was app based was it called the national
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:09.520]   oh they hired a hundred journalists built a newsroom built an app and within a year folded
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.800]   so one of the things that's different about notify that i think is remember facebook home
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:19.840]   yeah where facebook one of you that swap yeah but they wanted to be the the first thing you
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:25.760]   touch when you get an android phone well this is i think to me this is a kind of sort of like
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.920]   that because the news is not going to be inside the app you don't launch the app and then sit there
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:37.200]   and look at news it is based primarily on notifications so the notifications center is where you read
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.600]   the news well and and by the way we were talking about this on sunday on twit
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:47.520]   it used to be the home page is the real estate you wanted now it's the notification yes that is
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.320]   it turns out we're so busy we pay so little attention to what's going on that you want to get in the
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:19:00.480]   notification and to do that you have to be a standalone app right yep um that's the new that's the new
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.720]   ground zero that's the new that's one of the reasons why facebook wants everything to be in
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:10.400]   its own app because it adds a new opportunity to be in the notifications window and you won't be
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:14.000]   forgotten i mean this is the this is the real problem you know we're talking about how android
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.880]   is awesome because it has so many apps well you know how many apps can you really run so it's the
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:24.720]   shelf space issue with apps is just the biggest issue right the only issue really well i would
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:29.760]   never want like a monolithic facebook app they have so many crappy services that i just have no
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:35.680]   interest in at all and half the time i i don't even have the regular facebook app loaded i just
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:40.400]   have the messenger app because people actually use that and i really care about the baby pictures
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:46.160]   that are on facebook i think paper which was a facebook app with the same purpose basically yeah
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:51.920]   right that was a flop right they still i think you still can get it but yeah um i thought paper
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:20:00.560]   looked pretty good but it was facebook uh let's take a break we'll talk about uh smart
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:06.960]   smart replies you can show me how to use it an inbox uh i use inbox just i like inbox it does it
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.120]   does not work yet it doesn't work so you can't show it to me it's supposed to hit today but uh who
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:16.480]   knows all right i'll keep trying i'll do an ad and maybe it'll and then maybe it'll work i'll do
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:23.760]   an ad it's so interesting because um more and more when we talk about health and we talk about
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:31.200]   staying healthy of course the conversation was about exercise diet now it's about sleep
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:38.640]   more and more it's about sleep it's about getting a deep restful sleep not letting
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:46.240]   the your your phone or the internet distract you from that and it turns out this impacts health in
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:54.800]   so many in diet wait in heart health of course state of mind a good night's sleep is maybe one
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.800]   of the most important things you can do for your health and of course who wants to be tired all day
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:07.920]   that's why the Casper mattress is a mattress everybody should take a look at CASPR these are
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:13.520]   made in the USA premium mattresses that are designed to give you that night's sleep you've been
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:18.800]   craving no springs these mattresses are made out of a unique combination of memory foam
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:28.400]   and latex so that you get support and softness it's a very interesting feeling i love my Casper
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:34.400]   mattress they they are delivered for free in these comp surprisingly compact boxes here's one uh
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:39.600]   this is a queen size mattress easy to get in the room when i got my son wanted a queen size mattress
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:46.080]   and i in the in the frat house he's up three flights i got him a casper because he could easily get
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:49.280]   it in the room i don't know how he's going to get it out of the room but you know after a year in a
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:55.760]   frat house maybe you still want to take that time he's loving it he really loves it he says his
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:03.280]   friends love it too i don't know what that means you can you can you can buy it online and by the
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.920]   way you may say but wait i want i want to try before i buy you are trying before you buy well you're
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.960]   buying but then you have a hundred days to return it and get every penny back free delivery and yes
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:19.440]   friendly free returns should you not like it at all it's easy and you have a hundred days to do so
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.400]   they know they have to do that because you're not going to be able to try it in a mattress show
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:26.400]   room so they're going to have to let you try it in the house but i have to tell you you're not
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.200]   going to want to give up your casper but the first few nights you know take your old mattress set
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:37.360]   it aside put it in the basement keeper for a while just in case um it is amazing they're so
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:44.480]   restful so relaxing and very affordable because instead of that huge markup in the mattress store
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:48.640]   you're getting it direct from the factory five hundred dollars for a twin going all the way up to
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.920]   the biggest mattress nine hundred fifty dollars for the king size that is less than half what you'd
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:58.160]   pay for mattress of this quality at a mattress store and you're going to save an additional fifty
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:05.920]   bucks by using the promo code twig twig so go to casper.com/twig read up about it
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:12.160]   answer your questions take a look at how they're made when you order it make sure you use the
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:22.720]   offer code twig for fifty bucks off they say we need a casper in the uk says keith five twelve
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:29.920]   yes you do yes you do that's all i can say tweet at twelve fifty one
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:38.560]   two hours less than two hours ago by uh inbox by gmail thank you uh chatroom for passing this along
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:46.000]   thank you gardener to all those asking smart reply will start rolling out to inbox on andread and ios
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:54.640]   tomorrow uh oh uh i'm not sure this is gonna be all that useful the idea is
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:00.000]   and then here's a screenshot so you can kind of see what happens um i not do you got to use inbox
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   first of all which a lot of people don't like it's a very stripped down email client that takes
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:14.320]   advantages of the auto categorization built into uh gmail you'll have at the bottom of each message
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:19.520]   three responses i don't know if they're customized for message in this case it says i don't sorry i
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:24.400]   guess it must be yeah so i'll have to look for it yeah they're highly customized uh using
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:30.320]   very advanced ai so so the email begins do you have any documentation on how to use the new software
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.640]   if not maybe you could put something together and the automated response is ai i don't sorry i'll
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:41.360]   have to look for it or b i'll send it to you and then you do the attachment and you've written the email
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:49.280]   um yeah it's powered by google's like um uh it's a cloud-based natural language
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.920]   processor thing that they're like crazy research team just to admit it it's powered by what google
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:59.520]   knows about you it's it's actually it's interestingly it's not based on what it knows about you it's
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:05.120]   not customized in that way it isn't there's two there are two basic uh ai engines uh one is to
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:10.960]   understand the message and what they do is they go through the message word by word and it's purely
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:17.120]   semantic they they discard everything in style and they actually the software actually under tries
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:23.840]   to understand understand end quotes what it actually says if it's a long-winded message right it will
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:29.120]   get it that it it will seek not only is this something that needs a reply is this something that can be
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:35.360]   replied to in three to six words if not it doesn't do anything but if so it will take a shot at it and
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:42.640]   then it uses a different engine to construct using the same tone wow using and so what here's
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.880]   what this really is here's it here's the best way i think to to think about uh smart reply
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:52.320]   basically think about chatbots that researchers have been working on for decades they're trying
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:56.800]   to pass the touring test eliza yeah they're trying to create a chatbot so that you can text back and
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:03.120]   forth of the machine right and you can't tell that it's a machine or not it's no nothing has passed
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:09.280]   the touring test yet despite a couple of controversies and so what this is doing is it's taking that
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:18.240]   whole area of of research and it's applying it to not replacing the human inter you know a
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:24.320]   per con converse conversant but it's augmenting a human one and so what it's doing is it's essentially
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:30.720]   using the human as an editor in order to pass the touring test ultimately that's what this is and so
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:34.480]   so they're gonna i wonder if they get feedback from which ones you choose i bet they do they
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:40.240]   keep track of it yes they don't they don't they don't yeah but they don't okay they don't read
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.000]   no they promise that no human will ever read either what you get or what you say okay well no
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.400]   human since they don't read your email yeah no human does not mean no google so here's an email
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.440]   uh turkey hi all we wanted to invite you to join us for an early thanksgiving on November 22nd
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.560]   beginning around 2 p.m please bring your favorite dish RSVP by next week and the reply is don't call
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:08.160]   me in turkey yeah my reply would be i'd love to go to turkey when are you leaving no and so here
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:14.720]   the three replies by the way with exclamation marks which means they saw the exclamation mark
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:20.400]   in the body and they said oh that's how they write a number one is count us in exclamation mark
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:26.640]   number two is we'll be there exclamation mark number three is sorry we won't be able to make it
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:32.640]   period that's actually pretty good yeah that's i would love it yeah i would say they're gonna come
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:38.960]   out of the bojis here pretty soon uh that's pretty good my favorite story from this is when they were
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:45.520]   when they were working on it um the the algorithm would reply i love you to every message early version
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:53.760]   um so it's such a sweet computer yeah this is actually a great article it's on the google
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.040]   research blog this is not the announcement article but it's linked from the announcement article
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:04.400]   um it's describing how it works which is uh pretty impressive yeah um this is isn't this
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:10.640]   it's using recurrent neural networks uh two of them one to encode the incoming email and one to predict
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:18.000]   possible responses um but this is always what we wanted computers to do yeah right yep and i
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:24.000]   really get sad because so many people are so worried about privacy that they go oh no that means you
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.560]   have to read our mail and blah blah blah and i feel like we're not going to get the computer
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:36.240]   future the technology future we wanted because of people being so um privacy focused yeah now i
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:41.280]   understand i support privacy and all that but i want this stuff and if it has to read my email to do
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.960]   it fine yeah they're reading your email anyway for ads and and categorization and everything else so
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:52.880]   it's not like if people don't like that well but see i i you know i think that this is the thing that
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:29:01.120]   mislea you know then they are not reading your i'm gonna do an email it's anthropomorphic a machine
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:08.000]   that responds in specific ways if certain things are in in the email if if a forest falls in the
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   tree etc if nobody's actually reading if a human isn't reading it right then then i don't think
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.560]   they are reading your email it's and besides all that even if they were i agree with you Leo that
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.120]   there's if you know what you're getting into i think this is something that people shouldn't
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:27.280]   automatically reject the other thing is interesting about this is it it seems to me that
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:32.640]   inbox is sort of becoming a virtual assistant i love that's the direction it's coming i do too
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:36.400]   love it and and lots of people it's like twitter it's like a long experience with twitter in my
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.320]   experience with twitter people go to it and like i don't know i don't feel like i have that much
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:45.840]   control and they they leave and then maybe they come back yeah i really strongly recommend that
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:52.160]   everybody who can force yourself to use the in-box for a couple weeks and let google it's a great
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:57.040]   way i knew bumper sticker i achieve i don't have it today because Leo you've kept me very busy
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:03.360]   today but normally i keep a zero inbox all the time zero inbox i'm impressed and it's because of
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:09.760]   inbox it's so easy to procrastinate intelligently it's so easy to i use the feature of like okay
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:15.360]   make a go away and come back when i'm at home i don't want to see this news email yeah stuff like
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:21.280]   that it's such a great uh service i i really like inbox you know my problem is you can't you can't
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:26.320]   use it with exchange so yeah on android you have to use gmail to use exchange yeah and a lot of
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:31.440]   times like well i'm already in gmail now so and i think it still doesn't work with google for work
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:37.680]   and mail yeah i am i'm blissfully free of all of those things actually i've been considering trying
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:44.480]   to get uh everybody at work to use their work email which is a google for work email um because
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:49.280]   then we have better control over who has access to the documents and when you leave instead of having
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.880]   to go through the documents and seeing who has access to which documents we could just kill your
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:57.440]   your work email and then you won't have access to it anymore which is why you need android it works
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:02.880]   but you don't i don't Lisa doesn't know because we have to staff is using their personal gmail
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:09.120]   account right because we want these features right exactly you know the the closer we get to the release
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:14.320]   of the blackberry priv the the more i'm like man i hate software keyboards and and this this
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:20.400]   you're gonna get a blackberry priv i'm gonna try to play with one i don't i don't know but like
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.760]   this this feature is is an indication of like how much software keyboards suck because it's
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:30.560]   it's gonna type one sentence for you and on a desktop with a real keyboard you wouldn't care
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.880]   at all about that you're like i could type one sentence in in half a second but on mobile
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:39.120]   phone that's a huge pain in the butt so so having it type that that one second you know the one
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:45.520]   example was i'm on it like three words yeah but on mobile that's that's useful so well the the
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:50.800]   thing is that i'm excited about uh ron is that uh you know people talk about whether you know
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:55.760]   something is keyboard friendly or mouse friendly or whatever i think that these next generation
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:02.240]   ai based virtual assistants and and all these other features should replace
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:10.080]   the need to be typing all the time i mean i we we type way too much i think and i'd love to see a
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:15.120]   lot more intelligence uh where it's always suggesting things you want you want to just say
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:19.200]   this whole thing yeah just say that you know that sort of thing i mean if you think about think
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:24.320]   here's something that came up in all this uh blather about uh inbox smart reply which is that
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:31.120]   how often does everybody reply to email by saying sounds good exclamation point like yeah half the
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:36.640]   emails that i get i reply with that basically and so you know i've written i've written uh uh what
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:42.400]   do they call them in in gmail uh filters and and sort of macros and they sort of can't reply we've
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:49.840]   always have these sort of dumb approaches to semi-automate email and it's great to have some help from
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:58.720]   a massive artificial intelligence uh bank of servers i think yeah but uh yeah i really i really
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:03.680]   like this this whole thing and and of course the other thing's interesting about inbox is that it
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:09.760]   keeps getting smarter about various things so increasingly as you type in uh something especially
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:15.520]   into the reminders feature the so for those of you unfamiliar with inbox you can send an email or
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:19.600]   you can send yourself a reminder and i use the reminders thing all the time but if you start to
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:26.720]   type in certain things into the reminders box it will auto fill in uh certain things like pick
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:32.080]   up whatever i i don't remember the exact uh features and then oftentimes it will populate
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:39.120]   that reminder uh with some you know some intelligent thing so if you for example you're setting a
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:44.000]   calendar invite or whatever it'll put the link to the calendar invite in there stuff like that
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.120]   and i just want to see a lot more of that because i i i think that i love that everybody bad mouth
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:54.720]   see if it does a bad job yeah part of the process is helping we got to start yeah so and correct it
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:59.920]   and give it feedback so that it gets better yeah because i want the computer to know what i want
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:07.040]   yeah yeah and i love the fact that you know it well first of all everybody bad mouse email
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:11.840]   talking about how it's inadequate no email is actually pretty great because it's so universal
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:16.720]   right it's it's not a social network well so i i have to be on pinterest in order to communicate
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:22.880]   no it's it's email it's everybody uses it and and it's it's automatable and especially with things
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:29.280]   like uh with inbox the the people i'm i'm talking to you don't have to be an inbox but i can use
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:35.280]   inbox to do all kinds of right right amazing good points yeah and uh i just i just love it especially
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:39.280]   since i've been able to maintain the zero inbox thing which just gives me so much peace of mind it's
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:44.640]   uncomfortable i just wish google now would it be do more i feel like they've held back on that too
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:48.800]   and i'm worried that it's there that it's because of privacy advocates and they don't want to go
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.680]   too far because they're afraid that people get upset that they're creepy and they're too cautious
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:58.160]   about crushing the creepy well there was a there was an internal fight about google now the the
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:03.120]   android team wanted it right the google search team wanted to take it over so right so they've been
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.360]   they've been going back and forth about who exactly owns that and all that and and maybe now that
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:12.880]   that's decided i hope that they will you know add more features to it now i think it's got to be
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:17.600]   everywhere and including and especially in inbox i'd love to see i love it completely integrated
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:23.680]   in inbox yeah by the way just so you know Jason i i i went over and gave Jason back his uh
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:30.160]   uh next six piece so he could do his own you know i i you were very it's very generous of you to let
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:36.000]   me take that out no problem and open that because i wouldn't know i'm i'm spoiled because i have two
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.040]   next to six piece with me right now so it's okay now i just hate you i'm sorry i said anything
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:46.720]   but i love the verges article which says the next is six p will snap in half if you try to snap it
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.280]   in half which is true so don't try to snap it in half because you're not it will because it will
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:59.120]   apparently it does bend the box doesn't as we now know you're welcome but uh thank you
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:05.200]   but apparently you can snap it in half if you really try so don't yeah and just by the way from
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:10.080]   that video if you watch it he does a lot of things to the device before he ever tries to bend it i'm
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.240]   not saying that it wouldn't bend without that other stuff but i definitely am saying that
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.880]   the stuff that he does to it probably weakened it a little bit as well it just shows you that
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:23.840]   people will do anything to get clicks it's the world of youtube yeah thin smartphones are dumb
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:29.520]   give me a bigger battery i agree with that completely right that's what that's what's kind of making
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:36.240]   me mad i mean apple apple's able to do it this uh six uh s plus which is what i carry around i
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:39.920]   i can't i can't kill that it's indestructible as long as you charge it every night you're gonna
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:45.680]   be uh you're gonna get a big nice long day uh battery life and i just wish there were an android
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:50.800]   phone besides the one plus one which is the last phone that did that maybe then maybe the
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:55.680]   sony's do it people rave about the sony's i just get the blackberry battery is huge the pribs yeah
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:59.840]   four hundred milli-n-a-half hours well so is the six p that's it's thirty four fifties on the six
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:07.120]   b it should be better is the the smaller yeah okay smaller screen and is it uh four or uhd
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:13.360]   display on the prib or is it ten a p five point four inch four-teen forty p display curved ammo
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:20.800]   that if you want to get it it's ergonomically perfect according to the you know i am i wouldn't
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:28.320]   mind going back to a physical keyboard i guess yeah it has a shnidocluzh knock certified camera
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:34.640]   watch your language lee is the family shock what but what's so sad about this is this website is
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:43.840]   pathetic i'm a this blackberry it amazes me the iphone came out in 2007 eight years ago yeah and i
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:50.160]   would say now today blackberry has something that might compete with it maybe yeah and it's on android
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:59.200]   on yeah oh can i buy a proof uh choose a color black it's just like the model t color you want
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:09.680]   as long as it's black oh man uh on friday it'll be at atnt okay ships ships from blackberry directly
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:16.400]   on the ninth you really want this phone i can tell run i'm gonna have to buy one frickin blackberry
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.600]   will quote me in their blog post but won't send me a review you
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:27.600]   hate it hate it when that happens i i'm so astounded at how stingy some companies are and how badly
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:33.840]   it hurts them there are certain products that if they just gave everyone in the press one they would
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:38.000]   be guaranteed to dominate their their market segment and then all these companies like oh we
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.360]   have three avial units as soon as mop moshburg and jason howler done with the three units you know
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:48.480]   and to this kind of crazy because well blackberry is being super sleazy and i i think the plan is to
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:54.880]   give it to the fan sites first uh uh is gonna get one and uh and then once the super positive
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:59.280]   reviews can hang out for like a week then they'll probably send it to two more impartial people
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:05.680]   if for my business i do that yeah i get the strategy i just don't like it it's 700 bucks by the way
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:12.000]   yep but hey man you get a keyboard you get a hardware keyboard and and a hardware camera
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.280]   button and a hardware convenience key and there's like all this old school stuff on it that everybody
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:22.320]   cut off right to cut prices why don't they have an extending antenna that would be now you know
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:28.080]   you know you know that'd be cool this little slide out antenna that's awfully pricey wow i'm
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:33.280]   not sure i want to spend that much money to find out how bad this might be it'll be great i'll read
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:38.400]   ronamadio's review when it comes out and then i'll know if he ever if they ever give him one hey
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:47.040]   great high high praise to ome malek who two years ago said amazon will open a store watch
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:55.280]   he said two years ago he said the future of of shopping is obviously with amazon it's
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:01.200]   obviously with ordering online but we need somewhere to go to look at it yeah we need it's the it's
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:05.520]   the apple store model it's the uh and a microsoft same thing in fact i got a uh a
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:09.280]   tweeter an email from somebody said i wouldn't have bought the microsoft band had i not been able to
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.880]   go to the microsoft store i wasn't i looked at i thought i don't but then i tried at the store and
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:21.280]   i bought it and amazon is opening its first bookstore in seattle yeah and you know it's what's
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:28.320]   a book store and what's amazing about this first of all the books selection are chosen by ratings
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:33.920]   and sales on amazon.com interesting so it's it's sort of kind of crowd source that sense yeah the
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:39.360]   other thing is that the thing the reason amazon is harming physical brick and mortar bookstores
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:43.920]   is a phenomenon called show rooming right people go to a people go to barns and know well they're
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.040]   like oh this is i want to buy this book and so they whip out their phone and they order from
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.400]   amazon for next day delivery this is a this is the first store that i'm aware of ever created where
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:58.960]   show rooming is the main point is the amen seven says i thought best buy was the amazon showroom exactly
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.360]   but of all the things on amazon i definitely don't need to see before i buy a book is is at the
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:09.440]   tribal list who cares like that's true you can you can flip through the first couple pages on
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:15.680]   amazon anyway uh-huh but but uh ron they're also showing off their hardware their fire stuff
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:20.480]   and so it's also a kind of an apple store type of a concept where people can sort of be introduced
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:25.120]   i admit i felt like a kingle store yeah it's a kingle i did fall for the new uh kindle i ordered
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:32.400]   a paper white 300 dpi it happens it happens i bought i bought many a kindle which i have never
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:37.600]   used because i always end up using the phone or the tablet yeah but i really i keep thinking this is
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.280]   such a good idea and as we know it apparently the people who use e-book readers are falling
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:48.800]   dramatically i think was 19 percent well because of paper books which are on the rise they're big
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.040]   they're big and they're growing final records yeah yep and pretty soon we're all going to watch
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:58.480]   black and white tv because you know monochrome is always better yeah exactly no but i i think the
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:03.600]   vinyl record thing and the paper book thing are two different things the vinyl record thing is a
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:08.240]   sort of a hipster affectation for the most part the paper the paper thing i think is
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:15.520]   the paper and the paper uh book phenomenon i think is directly related to the number of hours we're
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:19.360]   spending already looking at a screen people just can't stand looking at screens anymore
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.440]   yeah it's like after you know the the number of hours people on smartphones is now about five
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.520]   hours a day on average and then we're looking at tv's and you know what i have a different
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:33.920]   solution i got i stopped reading books i only listen yeah that's what that was my solution is i just i
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.520]   if it's not an audible i rarely read it yeah you know in fact the only books i read that are not
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:41.360]   out of our programming books because it doesn't really make a lot of sense read a program plus
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:47.200]   they read every table right yeah they read the whole it's really plus all of this all of this extra
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:51.440]   book and and game stuff that you can do on your phone it's like if you do that on your phone you're
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:56.240]   gonna kill your battery and you're not be able to text anybody or or make a phone call or any of
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:04.640]   that stuff so yeah king okay talk about bad timing oh gosh king which creates candy crush
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:13.200]   just was sold to blizzard activation for five point nine billion dollars right this reminds me
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:21.120]   so much of omg pop yeah uh which was the game that sold for god a huge amount of money and then of
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:24.960]   course that not another game came out of them eventually they just shut the whole division down
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:32.320]   yeah they even already king has admitted we cannot come up with a sequel to candy crush
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:40.560]   just variations of the same game but this is the ultimate model for uh social and mobile games you
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:46.800]   you come up with a game that's so uh faddish and viral that it becomes a household name and sell
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:51.520]   sell the company sell everything that's the smartest thing you could do it's an all cash
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:57.840]   transaction this is three times the amount of money that facebook spent for oculus vr all cash
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:07.200]   it's a 25 premium to king stock price it is below this the public uh opening price their ipo
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:13.760]   opening price but uh still um activision is going to use 3.6 billion and cash held outside the us
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:20.160]   that's always the problem right is you offshore your money for tax purposes but then you you can't
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:25.360]   you can't repatriate it to buy something so you only buy stuff that's overseas which helps king
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:31.920]   because king i guess is in ireland uh so activision will use all of almost all of its offshore funds
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:38.800]   and then borrow the rest oh dear i wonder how much uh guiness you could buy with 5.9 billion dollars
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:44.640]   just one why is king worth that much i don't i think they're not well minecraft is worth two and
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:49.680]   a half billion how is candy crush worth more than twice that but the way active vision looks at this
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:53.520]   is that it's all going to mobile that's what they're freaking out about and so they think these
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:58.960]   guys know mobile yes but activation activation has been great at mobile hearth stone is like one
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.600]   of the best mover parts stone is a good example yeah that's good point they well that's the blizzard
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:09.440]   side right it's the only triple a like mobile game really i feel like
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:16.000]   unbelievable they're buying it for that advanced candy crush technology
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:24.720]   they have tried other games um so what does zinga pay for omg pop do you zoom in remember let me
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:30.560]   see if i could find it because that that's the classic uh you know in two years later they shut
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:36.080]   it down but the the risk of looking at previous acquisitions that is they keep getting so insane
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.800]   that right the old you know the old this is meaningless you should multiply by a thousand yeah
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:46.720]   200 million see they got a deal at the time is this huge amount nine billion dollars
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:54.480]   in a couple of years 200 million has become a paltry sum yes except if it doesn't have a b
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:46:00.720]   in the word i know but then you hear about sales of companies like um book a zell which sold for
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:05.840]   seventeen million dollars yeah just a year ago they got 63 million dollars in venture funding i
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:13.200]   have to think that that's yeah it's not good uh but but that's i mean it's you know they're they're
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:19.760]   actually doing gazelle is doing the ovens work that's not scalable they have to individually interact
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:24.480]   with every phone they buy inside whereas with games you just you know just make it once and make a
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:31.280]   billion downloads is more or less the same that's free profit um let's talk about facebook's results
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:43.920]   speaking of profit yeah uh 1.55 billion users um and uh was this up to date a billion users a day now
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:51.920]   daily active users a billion i believe so yes holy kamole that is insane and that's not counting
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:59.200]   what's up eight billion video views a day eight billion internet.org which was their initiative to
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:04.960]   get the uh offline third world online yeah what 15 million plus people online every day
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:12.080]   or no i just in general 900 million what's app users now compare that to what what twitter's 300
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:20.080]   some million yeah 900 million 700 million messenger users 400 million instagram users
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:26.800]   facebook scares me they have too many users 4.5 billion dollars in revenue
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:34.240]   um that's actually not that much no i mean they couldn't even buy uh candy crush with that money
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:41.680]   that's not that much uh it is did beat the street of course when you beat the street that's all
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:46.800]   good for the stock price yeah the street hates it but yeah the street hates facebook i'm just saying
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:55.040]   it just doesn't sound good the street loves facebook um what else uh percentage of monthly
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:48:01.280]   users have come back daily is 64.1 percent so really really is most people just check it every
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:08.560]   single day and 4 million new users in the us in canada that's more than twitter added in the us
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.440]   of canada like worldwide yep you know what's really impressive about their user numbers is that
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:19.120]   they're banned in china yes they don't even get to include it but but zuckerberg is working on it
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:26.320]   he's learning and he's he's gonna get into china net profit 896 million dollars
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:34.640]   um and uh that's okay again not enough to buy a candy crush yeah that's really not huge
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:40.480]   it's amazing that that they have so many users and i don't know i just find facebook so so so
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:48.480]   boring yeah well you just don't have good friends you need better friends my friend uh facebook now
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:54.240]   sees eight billion dollar video uh eight billion daily video views well those are fake they they
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:58.240]   autoplay video oh yeah you're right we shouldn't count that number you watch for a second you
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:03.760]   watches you scroll by you know now you look in fairness i believe the cut off is two seconds oh
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:12.080]   well let's be fair uh but they did put a lot of money to r and d and uh so forth so the thing that
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:17.120]   freaks me out about some facebook in addition to their user base is the fact is two two separate
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:22.240]   facts one of them is there they're doing the ao model they're trying to duplicate the internet
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:26.640]   so you never have to go on the regular internet you can live on facebook get the news on facebook
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.840]   to video on facebook get everything on facebook and the second thing is they're they're immune
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:38.480]   from the laws of of of nature they uh they they're the only major social network that still has a
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:44.160]   real names policy that total jerks about it it's a very biased and bigoted policy and there's no
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:50.160]   yeah consequence them uh are you serious is really upset because even though his facebook name is
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.960]   can't his real name is Ken goffman nobody's ever known for that he founded mondo 2000 he's an
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.480]   internet pioneer in fact as he pointed out in a letter to mark zuckerberg
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:05.760]   hey basically hey brat i created that thing you call social media without me you're nothing
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:11.200]   uh they won't let him use can are you serious goffman he has to just be plain old can goffman
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:16.800]   yeah that's just crazy yep um i understand you know we've talked a lot about the you know anonymity
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:23.120]   is what fosters trolls i understand it's desirable to have people use their real names but but they
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:28.720]   don't need it they just need pseudonymity they they should establish a process whereby
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:33.120]   you have to tell facebook what your real name is isn't that though what they say they say it's
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:38.080]   you're commonly accepted the name people know you by doesn't have to be a real name just the name
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:42.720]   people but you had somebody on rules are different today who they made him divide his or is that g plus
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:47.440]   how to divide his name into two names uh that's right he was a whatever exactly that was that was
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:52.800]   google he was complaining about google's real names policy right but the the the problem isn't that
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:58.960]   what their rules are though it's not what facebook says it's what they do right they don't actually
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:04.720]   have a real names policy they have a normal names policy so if i i could right now just create a new
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:08.480]   facebook account and i could call myself leo la port and they say fine that sounds like a real
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:12.720]   name but if i call myself something that sounds like it was a made-up name or sounds like a native
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:17.120]   american name or yeah if you have an american name or whatever they're like oh wait a minute
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:22.400]   and so it's not about they they don't have any way to tell if it's your real name they just want it to
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:30.400]   be normal which means a eurocentric name or commonly held man it's and and nobody cares this is the
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:36.080]   thing that bugs me they're immune to the pressure around this every other social network is because
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:41.120]   they have a monopoly on everybody right they have they have a network effect they can do anything
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:45.760]   facebook can do anything they want and and you see people you know complain about new facebook
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:49.840]   features all the time but it doesn't matter because all your friends are there they didn't add search
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:54.320]   until last week right and you tell people are they don't even have search and people are like
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:59.040]   whatever okay all my high school friends right they're all my former co-workers they're all my
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:04.560]   families there who cares about search you're right in fact kids uh i was talking to high school kids
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:10.560]   they know very well that their facebook profile will be searched when they get into the real world
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:15.680]   so they use a different name for their either they use a different name for their high school
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:20.000]   profile or then when they get a grown up they change their name to something else yeah
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:26.000]   uh and that works and it doesn't stop that and then they put phony of post for the family to see
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.040]   on facebook and then they're run off to snapchat and do their real communication right
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:35.920]   oh well okay we can go on and on about how bad facebook is but doesn't matter we're all still
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:43.040]   using it yes i keep i quit it once but i realized as a tech journalist you can't not use facebook that's
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:47.760]   right yeah that's this i mean here we are talking about that's a huge part of the story like it or
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:54.000]   not yep but now i realize that's how everybody feels it's nobody wants to be on facebook you just
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:00.400]   can't not be it's like the phone system yeah yeah you can't say oh i have a small business but we're
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:04.720]   not gonna have phones we're not gonna have a phone number you can't reach it no you can't do that i

[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:45.200]   yeah this is a podcast called design notes it's design notes at fm it's uh it's from
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.560]   leham spradland who works at android police and and does does a bunch of other stuff but it's a
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:56.000]   podcast about design usually designing android apps and and talking to people that design
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:01.920]   applications and kind of what tools they use and how they go about oh that sounds great you know
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:06.800]   coming up with these new interfaces if if you go down the one that was october first was with
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:12.880]   roman uh nurick who works at google it was it was really interesting talking about yeah that one
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:17.440]   it was really interesting hearing them talk about you know what what kind of he uses internally as a
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:25.120]   guy that that works at google and you know how he kind of does uh design advocacy for other uh
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:30.640]   for third parties and stuff like that it's it's one of those areas that doesn't really get
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:35.280]   talked about a lot like you can you know you can read android news from anybody till you're
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:40.160]   brewing the face but not too many people go into design and like leham is an actual designer like
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:45.280]   he works on nova launcher and and all sorts of other apps so it's very interesting oh here's a guy
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:52.400]   did nova launcher and kind of coincidentally this week's episode is with the designer uh

[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:25.920]   and i uh they embed soundcloud stuff there but it's on iTunes and okay and all sorts of all
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:30.720]   the usual podcast stuff oh good all right i actually like soundcloud it makes it very easy to play
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:38.000]   right on the page here yeah all right uh your pick of the week uh mike elgan well the we all
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:43.680]   we all suffer from the problem of internet distractions the internet is very distracting
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:48.640]   and from an evolutionary perspective it's evolving become ever more distracting meanwhile
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:55.280]   we feeble puny humans do not uh evolve accordingly to resist said distractions and therefore we
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:02.320]   need technology to help us with that and i'm i'm uh recommending today a chrome extension called
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:09.360]   dayboard now dayboard helps you survive distractions and here's how it enables you to do that it's
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:14.880]   it replaces the new tab whenever you open a new tab in chrome all right so you see it every time
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:20.640]   and it's uh it gives you the opportunity to have five to do items so you you know we all have to
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:24.800]   do items there's probably hundreds of items but but really you're not going to do hundreds of items
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:29.840]   today no you you'll be lucky to do three items maybe so what this does is you can put five
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:36.720]   exactly five items uh on your dayboard new tab interface it's very clean and clear you can you
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:41.200]   know click it to cross it out if you've done it and every time you open it you get described you
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:44.640]   look you look a squirrel and you go off to the internet to check them the app first thing you do
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:49.040]   is open a new tab it reminds you oh yeah it's a word tps reports to do and all that other stuff
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:55.600]   it also has a if you if you really want to get crazy with it it's got a a view that just shows
[01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:01.440]   you the the first item and so every time you open a new tab it's in very large letters do this
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:07.360]   and uh it's a great way to stay on track now if you don't complete all the items it forwards the
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:11.680]   uncompleted items to the next day so the next morning you open it up and there's the stuff
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:16.640]   you didn't do yesterday it runs offline so if you're on an airplane you open and using chrome or
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:22.800]   chrome OS it will be there for you uh and they've also got a team version coming so if you've got a
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:26.880]   team you can set up this whole team thing and you can look at whatever what other people are working
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:32.640]   on today and it has other sophisticated things but forget all that right now uh it's great the way
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:38.000]   it is because it will show you those five items and i've i've introduced this to half a dozen people
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:45.040]   and every single one of them loves it because the psychology of constantly being reminded not
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:52.080]   having to go find where is my list it's always coming up it's always popping up because you're always
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:59.360]   opening up new tabs dayboard search for it on the chrome extensions site and you will find it very
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:05.840]   uh very productivity inducing you know i use a vunder list for my to do list and they also do
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:11.040]   the same thing on a fresh tab but it could be a very long list so this seems like a good maybe
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:19.760]   alternate way of doing this dayboard it's free it's a chrome uh extension so i guess my pick is
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:27.120]   something i already talked about but just a little more information on duos or ami duos from ami
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:36.160]   remember ami america megatrends they did the biosis yep for all the old pcs um they have done a windows
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:45.680]   seven android emulator uh there's two versions there's one that comes i'm not sure why um with uh
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:52.000]   is it ice cream sandwich comes with an old version of jelly bean and then there's one
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.520]   for version two point other comes with lollipop it's not upgradable with the standard updater so
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:06.400]   it's like lollipop 5.0.1 but that's fine um and it also does not come with the google apps but they
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:11.680]   point you to where to download it and add it and it's a simple thing to add it and when you do that
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:19.680]   now you have pretty much on a windows machine an android device so actually uh i installed all
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:27.360]   the apps where on my nexus six including nova launcher my file launcher and 500 px screens uh you
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:32.080]   know live wallpaper so i always have my beautiful wallpaper all the apps around here and as i showed
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:41.680]   you it pretty much works um just like android i mean i it with a lot of space as if android
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:49.840]   were on a massive uh phone but the the i think the number one use for me now is playing uh video
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:57.760]   games fallout shelter plays great on this um uh so so does so to most of the apps fact almost all
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:02.240]   the apps run just fine it is an emulator i don't feel like it's particularly slow
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:10.000]   hung up on me well look what do you want it's this is better than bluestacks uh bluestacks it was
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.320]   very limited in what i could run i think i made a mistake pressing that button i think i appreciate
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:20.880]   and and you are pushing it about as hard as you can push it on that that uh what 3200 by whatever
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:25.280]   screen you can't really get a bigger oh i see it's downloading the the latest instagram that's the
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:32.800]   highest res windows device on earth yeah it looks good doesn't it uh so um i think for developers
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:38.000]   this would be a great way to uh to try out your android apps if there's an android app you want
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:44.640]   to use the you know you can't uh get working on windows maybe uh netflix or i don't know there's
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:51.520]   just something you would like to have it all works here uh mirror cat oh actually camera apps don't
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:56.720]   work at least on this surface book and they may work on some windows devices uh it's probably
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:03.040]   something about the driver situation is it windows only is windows only seven eight or ten they don't
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:10.880]   have a mac version um it's pretty wild i mean just just to see these apps on a on a high res
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:15.440]   screen is pretty amazing easily the most expensive android tablet
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:21.280]   well the good news is the software is free for 30 days and 15 dollars if you want to buy it so it's
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:28.400]   it's not it's not horrifically expensive um i always always wanted to be able to run
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:34.240]   particularly android games on here because there's no now of course i can run many of them on my
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:39.760]   android tv but uh this is this is kind of wild you know any crossword puzzles all that stuff
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:50.240]   um pretty crazy it's uh it's free to try for 30 days and the website is amidus
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:56.080]   dot com it's ami duos i guess how do you think you pronounce that
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:04.080]   ami duos nobody knows no one knows actually after playing with this a little bit um i've
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:10.640]   invited uh the ceo of uh ami on to triangulation so we're gonna talk to him uh about this program
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:15.760]   gary vaynerchuk by the way monday on triangulation and the following week larry wall
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:19.920]   the creator of pearl will join us that's gonna be a lot of fun
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:25.760]   ronomadio is at ours technica he's a must read if you are into android he's the guy i mean just
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:32.640]   basically the guy did you ever update your on hub review or you it's basically the same your
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:38.160]   your thoughts um they haven't done much in the way there's there's been like one software update i
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:45.040]   think they kind of changed the way uh wi-fi worked but nothing nothing super significant worth
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:50.240]   writing about i tried that that crazy uh somebody rooted it uh in a couple weeks ago turn it into
[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:55.680]   a chrome book yeah i i haven't been able to get that i wouldn't work exactly how about that now
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:06:01.440]   and now they have a new one the asus built by asus at a tp link but it was because of your review that
[02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:08.560]   i canceled my on hub uh purchase it hadn't been shipped yet and i but instead bought an asus
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:15.760]   ac 3200 and it's super fast it's a great router i'm so happy and with more functionality than the
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:21.360]   on hub had yeah there's absolutely no reason to buy an on hub today yeah someday maybe it will
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:28.160]   be useful but but not right now yeah anyway that's why you got to read ron yeah ours tech
