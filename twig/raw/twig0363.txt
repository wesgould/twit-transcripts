[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.520]   you. We did not post nor allow anyone to make a ringtone out of your
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.360]   exposts it's postulations yes last week. I saw I had heard something. I felt bad
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.560]   actually in hindsight I thought oh probably this I didn't mean to hurt your
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.600]   feelings or anything. You didn't hurt my feelings I was just like oh man. It's
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.520]   going on to you. The thing that comes up for the rest of my life. No. No so it's
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.760]   not it's dead I was asked many times for a copy and I have declined. Tell I will
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.840]   still get excited about things on the air you guys I promise. Oh thank you that
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.800]   was the only thing I was worried about. Oh no it's unrelated enthusiasm so that's
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.280]   coming. I like that's what I like about you. You're enthusiastic in the face of
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.720]   these old couple of old guys who are seeing it all I'm bored by everything.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.720]   Yeah that's for sure.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.080]   Rename your show here Leo. Watch out. Yeah one of those two old guys in the
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.040]   Muppet Show. Alright. Oh those are my favorites. Yeah Jeff Jarvis is also
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.160]   here president journalism the City University New York blogger at Buzz
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.840]   Machine.com the other many a great book including the exparing gifts and public
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.080]   parts and what would Google do. Hello Jeff. Hey so I don't know what to start
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.680]   with. You got Russian hackers you got Apple earnings you got just all kinds of
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.600]   news. It's hard nowhere to begin Twitter. Twitter did well but not in the stock
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.080]   market. They didn't have much growth only three million new users about one
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.640]   percent growth over the last quarter that's not making the stock market happy.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.840]   They made money but they scared the stock market by saying it's getting it's
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.360]   harder to sell ads than we thought it would be. Yeah. Did you see their
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.480]   commercial? You want to see it? It's helping people understand Twitter right
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.680]   because nobody's trying to I was a mixed thought about it. I don't know if it is
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.200]   really the thing people experience in Twitter. Did you see it Stacey? I didn't.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:19.360]   I don't have television. Oh you are. What's happening? That's not it.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.600]   It's it's it's it's well I'm I can't I can't scroll down this happens every
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.440]   time I play. Oh no that's that's the end of it again. This is a flaw in the
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.840]   next web's website. I can't you you had the same problem. Oh yeah you can't
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.000]   scroll down. It's because they have this lame animal you can't either. Somebody
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.960]   ought to tell me next to my game. It's very inconvenient for Leo show. Is it
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.160]   convenient for everybody? You're trying to watch. There's something that there's
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.480]   like two or three sites where that happens to me. Point but the web is really
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.200]   broken. Now I'm gonna be in favor of AMP. Yep. They shouldn't really use AMP. The
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.720]   web is broken. Anyway so the idea is Twitter is where it happens right? This
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.800]   is what's happening in the world. You know what's happening in the world. That's
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.600]   why I beat you. Yeah. Here we go. What's happening and then showing tweets in many
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.360]   languages. What's happening in the world versus the Olympics and what's ever you
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.880]   talking about Trump and Clinton. Game of Thrones. It's trending. Hamilton.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.280]   These days they had a good life. How did it start? Black Lives Matter. Well this is true right?
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.960]   Yeah. Didn't Dale Rimmick has to say that Black Lives Matter started at Twitter.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.840]   Started with Twitter. Is this gonna drive people to Twitter? Love not hate. See what's
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.040]   happening in the world. Well you know it ties into two of course. They're now doing
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.160]   Major League Baseball NBA basketball NFL football. You know what I'm thinking? I
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.120]   think Twitter is the new Yahoo. Oh that's that curse. Maybe Marissa could go over
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.040]   there. I think we're gonna see stories you know what is Twitter. Just like we saw stories
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.480]   but what is Yahoo. I love Twitter in a lot of ways. I don't in other ways but but well
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.320]   Twitter is really interesting and I think in many ways it mirrors the internet. It is
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.960]   simultaneously the best and the worst. Yeah yes yeah and it's hard to monetize.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.200]   Has it open ecosystem? It mirrors the internet. I risk my case.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.600]   I think that commercial like Twitter is it's great for journalism. It's great for if you
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.120]   really legitimately want to know what's happening but I don't think that many people in the world
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.800]   like a huge swath of the population. They're not it. They're looking to the internet still for
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.840]   entertainment and how do you monetize news? No one knows. I mean that's very right Stacey.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.840]   Well a lot of people while they do on Twitter is they look for for stars. That didn't really do that.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.400]   Yeah so like show me a Taylor Swift's latest beef with CDFairy and then I'd be like
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.640]   hot days. They're not gonna show you that. But that's like Instagram and even Snapchat.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.040]   Look at what Kim Kardashian did. Well but this is where Twitter is at a disadvantage because
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.880]   unlike Snapchat and Instagram it's many many things. So there's black Twitter right? They
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.280]   didn't I mean they mentioned black lives matter but they don't talk about the cultural phenomenon
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.720]   that is black Twitter which is much more than black lives matter. It's the thing that Mark Zuckerberg
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.160]   he said I think he said it to me years ago. No two people on earth see the same Facebook
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.440]   because you see your community your language and they kind of make the point with the languages but
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.520]   it's it's your own world and and you can make it what you want to be but that means you got to work
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.160]   at it. Well you know first of all you can't make an ad especially a 30 second ad that's going to show
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.200]   all the things that Twitter is. I think this ad is has one single purpose which is to say
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.560]   Twitter is and I think this is absolutely one of its greatest values. The place to go to see what
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.520]   the culture is doing right now. What's happening right now or a slice of the culture let's be honest.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   Well many slices the problem is you don't see all the slices right but but if you look at
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.600]   whatever done an ad. Oh yeah remember the chair Facebook is a chair. That's right that's right
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.440]   the best now. I mean if you want a bad ad that's true or an inscrutable ad that's it at least this
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.440]   you can't say this is wrong this is what part of what it's just it's just a part of what Twitter is
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.600]   but it's one of them it's one of the best parts you know there's actually a whole
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   bunch of people upset at Twitter because of the DNC leaks slash DNC leak hashtag
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.960]   I don't put this in air quotes scandal. A number of people tweeted me and said
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:50.240]   DNC leaks was trending and Twitter pushed it off the trends. I've heard this one so often people say
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.320]   surely this is trending surely this is trending and remember that in a while but again trending
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:00.080]   does not mean most popular trending is a as a mysterious formula. Is it specific to
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.840]   is it specific to the people you following you I've always wondered that because
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.560]   no it's pens you have to their settings market yeah okay so you can have global you can have
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.320]   US you can have it used to be able to have a local I don't know if you know it's not personal
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.840]   but it's not personal it's geographic which would be interesting trends once training among your
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.320]   friends so the the evidence of people using by the way the chatroom is convinced that Twitter
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.240]   pulled it down how did it go from the top of worldwide trends to nowhere like that
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:35.120]   does that happen ever with other trends yeah I remember this is a I remember this
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:43.120]   for by the way it was replaced by a DNC leak and some say well that was to down to reduce it they
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:49.440]   split it or something I don't know I dig this is this is similar to the argument that Facebook
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:57.760]   is is currying the the feed to promote an agenda and that the the latest one that broke this morning
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.360]   is that Google has when if you Google presidential candidates that they fixed it you can't do it
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.200]   anymore but if you this morning if you Google presidential candidates you would only get three
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.960]   out of the five you wouldn't get Trump and you wouldn't get Gary Johnson the libertarian
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.800]   that's because those those elections were already done so they were still in primary mode
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.080]   until the convention was over the way the algorithm works wrong but there was a reason behind it
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.600]   they fixed it well the original the regional one had Trump if you did this if you did search
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.400]   for presidential candidates Trump Clinton Sanders Johnson and Stein who were all the
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:42.240]   major party in a couple of smaller party candidates and then this morning it was just the three
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:50.000]   Clinton Sanders and Stein actually say why is Trump first hey yeah why is Trump first
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.440]   not my party not my last name well because we have two Democrats I don't know
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:05.520]   this is this is a land this is landmine this is a mine field for any of these companies
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.320]   and I would guess that Twitter Facebook and Google would bend over backwards to try to
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:16.960]   just make it nonpartisan but it's very hard and and algorithms being algorithms are unruly
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.040]   you know I just wondered too so if you looked at most popular pictures of Donald Trump it would
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:28.080]   probably be his huge face and that with that with that you know odd Orwellian huge face behind him
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.720]   how do they end up choosing the pictures for things like that yeah you always see that
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.920]   that no magazines do that right we've seen that in the past remember the say say or a palin
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:45.520]   a cover was it a time or news week that was very unflattering and these are flattering right
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.720]   so I'm saying is if you just went with the most popular pictures through search I'll bet
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.360]   wouldn't be flattering sure maybe they go through the campaign maybe the campaign websites
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.680]   is where they get it from because that's a slight like trusted source what is a flattering
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:04.960]   picture of Donald Trump I'm sorry well he loves yeah any picture of him is probably good for him
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:10.720]   yeah he does but I'm just saying that because he is a very has a very expressive face in his
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:18.000]   and almost all the pictures of him are grimacing or shouting or he's very expressive it all it all
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.800]   comes out in his face so you don't have any kind of posed unless there's a big eagle
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:30.400]   imposed pictures of of him none of the magazine pictures make it because they're copyright maybe
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.440]   or I don't know I'm I don't want I'm not an apologist I just I think that it's tempting to see
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.160]   a trend where none exists that's the human brain is designed to do that
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:47.120]   and you'd be crazy if your Facebook Twitter or Google and under all this scrutiny to ever attempt
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:53.440]   something like that or would you no I mean what's happening what would I wouldn't even trust an
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:59.520]   algorithm at this point to do a lot of this stuff I mean because would you trust a human well
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.920]   yes it depends on the human but yeah you'd have to have some really
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:12.560]   you know how journalists used to be objective and we used to like not vote and all of these
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.200]   things just gonna be like you'd have to have someone who kind of subscribes to that set of
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.240]   beliefs and I but I agree with you Stacy I think I think that there has to be I've argued to Facebook
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.880]   I would argue to all these companies and this sounds so professionally egotistical
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   that we need a journalist there but my point is they need someone who makes decisions based on
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:37.280]   principles to serve the public almost a public editor editor there shouldn't edit it shouldn't
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.560]   select things shouldn't try to organize it but but when there is a choice somebody sits back and says
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.960]   what's the best thing for the public here as opposed to at the same table somebody's gonna
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.720]   say what's the best thing for our brand which they should they'll be there somebody else has to say
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.520]   ah no you miss serve the public that's a bad thing and they need that discussion which I don't
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.320]   think they're having I mean there's there's like three stories in this was rundown about Facebook
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:06.000]   taking things down what about the leak email issues which I don't really understand the story
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.800]   one about news footage from child torture and one about a diverse lingerie model nothing revealing
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.040]   but for some reason they took it down and I want to know what is there's had some principles behind
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:25.760]   this why are they taking down what and I don't and these are to serve the public or is it to just
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:31.360]   dodge as many controversies as they can which I understand but now that they're in a role
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:37.040]   distributing news and informing people you know if you take down pictures of transgender models
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.920]   you're saying something about transgender models and you've got to face up to that
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   which is yeah that's the question is who's who's your public when you're an international
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:56.720]   social media that has a billion people with many viewpoints and I don't know I wouldn't want to be
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:04.320]   them I wouldn't want to have it but maybe they need like a public maybe they need market Sullivan
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:11.520]   leave the way to that's what they needed yeah an ombudsman a public editor but it's also someone
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:17.280]   who actually is opposed to a Margaret Sullivan nor now let's say her replacement who from a
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:24.320]   distance criticizes the New York Times instead what they need is somebody inside who explains
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   the principles of journalism and the business of journalism to Facebook and in turn and explains
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:37.440]   Facebook to the news industry which they need I don't know if that's do you think that's going
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.720]   to make Facebook money do you think that's I mean well that's what people accuse both Facebook and
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   Google of they say that their agenda is not is only what makes them the most money that you can
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.480]   have any company including newspaper well it's always true it was true but I think I think Stacy
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:00.160]   I would argue that in the long run if people start to depend upon them for information then
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:07.280]   being more credible trustworthy and predictable about that information is a good thing for the brand
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.080]   and ultimately the business so I feel like generationally we no longer trust our
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.680]   I think the era of trusting in a news source is probably gone does that make sense so like
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.320]   you don't even look at your websites or sorry your actual newspapers free of bias anymore you
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.960]   just have to suss out what they are I don't know right so that's a transparency so what
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.520]   I think we're saying the same thing in the long run I don't think that Facebook or anybody has to
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.200]   say that we are the new objective they're transparent and and they just as Facebook a few weeks ago
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.560]   put forward its principles behind the news feed and said this is how how we decide what goes
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:48.080]   the news feed in a very general terms but it was a good start similarly and they do have standards
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:57.680]   they do say no naked breasts period up except for breastfeeding except for post-surgery so they've
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:02.480]   you know they put that out there and they don't care these are the rules are well they've got to
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.800]   do a good job of being transparent about those principles and their enforcement of them
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.600]   it's tough once you become an arbiter it's so tough and you're always going to make you're
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.080]   going to just piss somebody off because oh oh whatever guidelines you use are going to
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.640]   it's going to be upsetting to somebody so that's why you know really
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:29.200]   Twitter I'm sure would like to be completely not participant in any of this and just say
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.960]   what they they sense at the least wouldn't you say I mean you make a breast no problem on Twitter
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.480]   that's that was the discussion last week about Nero yeah um was why it was such a shock that they
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.360]   banned Nero because I can't that's the I can't remember them banning anybody before
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:53.520]   how about this one google getting a lot of criticism this is an article in the New Yorker for
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.440]   deleting a literary blog if we got criticism last week for not bringing this up but the
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.840]   story had just happened and it just seemed to me that we just didn't know enough but now I agree
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.400]   it's definitely a story because I don't hear any good reason I mean google also believes in the
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:14.000]   in the portability of your data why for for some reason they didn't want it there a again
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.240]   transparency why not and then b let the guy export all the stuff so Dennis Cooper is a writer he has a
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:26.320]   blog it's a google blog called the weaklings it's got a lot of fiction on it some of it is
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:36.720]   a challenging there's sadism there's self-destruction as homosexuality it warns you before you go in
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:43.040]   as as all blogger blogs do if there's adult content in there and he's been writing there for a long
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.040]   time in fact it's been his and this is why it's significant his chief form of publishing for a
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:56.560]   lot of this stuff now of course Cooper should have kept backups of everything never the less
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.280]   I don't do I don't have backups what I put on medium I don't I haven't backed up Jeff I didn't
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:07.920]   back up what I did years ago can you make a backup of your content Jeff on medium you don't
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.320]   how many times I have to tell you you don't own and if it's on some other site I don't know I don't
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.040]   know this is Kevin Marks would spank you right now yes Kevin Marks would be up and this is like
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.280]   everything Kevin Marks stands for right but Kevin I Kevin might just simply say well but yeah we've
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.480]   been saying that of course if you're posting on Facebook or Twitter or Google or anywhere you
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.000]   you it's not your site now a blog is a little different yeah and that's why it's interesting
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.200]   I got my blog yeah because this was his blog now admittedly it's run by Google and it's a free
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:42.320]   service from Google but you always think even if your blog is hosted by somebody else it's my
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:49.120]   content my blog Google not only deleted the blog in its contest but killed his gmail account so they
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.880]   actually deleted the account so he has no way of going to Google takeout and getting the content
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.600]   back that's the issue and go and Google's lack of transparency the press I mean New Yorkers
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.440]   rained about this and they can't get an answer on Google this is a failed Google there may be some
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:11.280]   reason but but be transparent about about your process and allow someone to export those are
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.240]   principles that you've you've you've expoused before and you're and you're failing on and a blog is a
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.440]   little different because people assume that's my blog you know my blog's on Squarespace now
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:27.040]   admittedly it's but it used to be on software it's on somebody else's computer so are you backing
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:32.240]   that up of course okay I'm not okay so you have everything set up now for for I have everything
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:39.200]   backed up now yeah I've always have had everything backed up but still you think that's my blog
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.040]   that's different than putting a post on Facebook which you know could be taken down
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:49.920]   anyway Google doesn't have much of an answer they speculate that it was because he violated terms
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:59.040]   of service but Google doesn't even know and she she talks to Dennis Cooper and he doesn't want to
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.720]   say it's censorship he thinks it probably was due to violation terms of service but he was not told
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.960]   and he doesn't know why they deleted his Google account because that's not part of it
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.080]   this does seem like there needs to be some kind of I mean due process is a legal term not a
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.160]   service-oriented term but but you want to know that that if you go over the line you've got some
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:25.600]   chance to rectify or leave or whatever some form of justice Google hasn't according to this Google
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.360]   hasn't really talked to him no officially I mean and his lawyer he hired a lawyer so here's what the
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:38.000]   New Yorker got regarding your inquiry this is from Google's press team we're aware of this matter
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.840]   and not able to comment on specific user accounts thanks so the reporter Krasinski also emailed the
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:51.920]   same Google employee who tried to help Cooper because you know and she advised she'd been advised by
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:59.600]   Google to refer all press requests to the press department you speculate on any legal world where
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:06.000]   they they would be forced to do this no um if well maybe if like Cooper was going to sue them like
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.400]   once Cooper got a lawyer maybe Google was like oh shoot well now they're gonna yeah and maybe now
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:18.240]   they uh they had to climb up I don't I mean yeah this this whole thing if it was a mistake it's a
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:25.760]   mistake that's gone too far and now they're like scrambling yeah it's kind of reminds all of these
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:32.080]   are of a piece you know all these stories are of a piece uh these companies are huge and they
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:39.440]   wield kind of a lot of power uh the other side of that flip side of that twitter ad is you're also
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:45.040]   now the journal of record so uh with great power comes great responsibility and
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:51.600]   I don't blame them because we're in a new world and uh when no nobody's ever had a billion and a
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.680]   half customers before you know it's just that it's a new world and I understand why this is
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:04.720]   difficult let's take a break uh Jeff Jarvis is here from CUNY right teaches professionalism
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:10.080]   what's it professing alism he teaches journalism professional journalism or I call it for very
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:19.360]   pre-journalism and and then what's happening with dot NYC um I've been doing kind of a rethink of it
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.320]   and just today I sat down with Annie our producer and we're gonna try some different forms over the
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.760]   next three weeks go to experiment with some different forms and figure out what it is how
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.720]   can people find out when you're gonna do a show uh we're gonna do on Wednesday noon-ish okay and
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.000]   follow my twitter feed and i'll promote it and then we'll have dot NYC show twitter handle and a
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.760]   dot NYC show facebook DOT NYC on twitter show show the O.T. and I think so I think so I think so
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:52.960]   at Jeff Jarvis and new yas me on on Wednesday good and you do it on youtube live and facebook live
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.560]   or facebook we're gonna try facebook live for a while so that works out and we're just at this
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.760]   point we are experiment we're gonna try two or three different forms because because I think as we
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.800]   discussed we haven't found our niche yet we are gonna work on that first it is very it's much
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:11.440]   harder than I thought yes I have just been extremely lucky uh no you know you're talented when we
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.720]   watch the show we just uh we picked the right people uh and the and the right time to do it and
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.840]   it just did very well out of the box you know though Jeff that we've canceled more shows than we've
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:28.560]   no yeah that we do it's kind of normal you know you try stuff no one no one has the formula
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.960]   so you just try stuff Stacy Higginbotham is also here she is a sem what were you assembling
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:42.720]   earlier so blue tooth it's a this is a silicon labs thunderboard react which is a tiny little
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:47.360]   bluetooth thing that's got an accelerometer some LEDs and I'm gonna stick it on a
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:54.400]   uh what's this it's a model car kit oh fun so this is what my daughter and I are gonna do this
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:25:00.960]   afternoon after the show oh man you are the best mom yeah this is this is better than the box car
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:10.320]   Derby yeah do you do any uh any IoT stuff with your Tesla um not really it's I tried out the
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.360]   Eve stuff that we talked last week yeah about last week um but other than that it's not very
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:21.280]   easy the Tesla it's not easy to connect to things and I don't really want to hack my car yeah and
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:26.400]   I don't think they yeah I don't think they encourage it no Elon gets pretty testy about that yeah
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:32.960]   I it does you can't even get to it that TV on the browser no I mean that that's that's not a real
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:41.680]   browser it's okay you shouldn't be browsing should be browsing while you're driving true that hey let
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:47.760]   me tell you this autopilot thing uh has really um hurt Tesla owners you know we we're trying to get
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.960]   we have car insurance for it um but they initially the deductible is 3000 they've raised it to 6,000
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:01.120]   and then they are agent today said you're not going to use autopilot are you and we said yeah
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:07.600]   and she said oh that's going to be a problem they see that it not as a positive which I think it is
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.960]   it makes you a better driver safer driver it saves you it saves lives they see it as a negative
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.480]   well because the first trial the first cases will be legal help for whatever insurance company gets
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.320]   them yeah but I think you could make strongly make the case that driver assist is is I agree with
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.400]   you but but you know how that's going to get challenged in court if you're the first insurance
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:34.640]   company that goes down in this case I don't know what it is you have and well have you
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.680]   priced it out in other places the other thing is we noticed when we told our insurance company
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:46.960]   that we were getting a Tesla he calculated as a p85 so the performance version and I just have
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:53.360]   the normal 85 and that actually dropped my cost of course because you don't have insane mode
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:59.840]   but but I think this is new is what I'm saying I think because of that big story
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.120]   and the number of stories about autopilot failures failures yes all of a sudden
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.320]   this is becoming an issue and I think it's an issue three thousand dollars a doctor was
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:16.880]   only six thousand no you don't have a choice it's now six thousand and I don't know what they're
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.920]   going to come back to us but I don't know if they're going to refuse this insurance because we say
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:26.640]   we're going to use autopilot autopilot is the pit bull of auto insurance that's going to be it's
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.480]   going to be I mean I think Tesla's going to have a problem if they keep people can't get insurance
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:39.200]   because of this who's sure who's your person it's yeah all around we do it well so it's a
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.840]   it's a corporate lease the company owns a car and so it's our it's a company that we've been
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:49.120]   using for all of our company insurance all this time and we use an agent so they all shop it I'm
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.440]   sure if they can't get but I think it was the agent who said oh we're gonna have a problem here
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.960]   and I and you can't lie and say no I'm not going to use autopilot because if you do it
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:05.440]   Elon knows and you have all the liability Santa knows yeah right I never lie to insurance
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.640]   companies because that's a great way for them to deny you coverage after the fact when you need
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:19.680]   it most right unbelievable uh wow we live in interesting times yeah I think I think it was
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:25.520]   Volvo and maybe your chit the chair I'm saying Audi I'll also do this but they claimed that they
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:31.680]   would do they would keep the liability or pay for liability I would suspect I suspect that's what
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.880]   Tesla will have to do oh does that fit with Elon's big plan sure he wants to it's for
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.000]   a little integration of everything the leasing is through Tesla so actually which is also was
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.440]   also the case for Volkswagen Audi they have their own finance and GM does to GMAC I would
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:54.320]   bet that Tesla drivers as a group are they're older they're richer you don't want to crash
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:00.800]   on a car exactly they're actually a decent risk you're you're older and richer no you're younger
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:07.200]   and richer I also bought my news so I'm not even when you said you graduated from college in 2000
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:13.280]   I went oh wow oh all right well you're the you just brought down the demo

[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.680]   internet connected doorbell you might say why connected doorbell to the internet oh I'll tell you
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:46.080]   why because this doorbell has a camera and a microphone and a speaker and when I installed the
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:54.720]   ring video doorbell man it changed the way I think about it's not it's a I don't you know I literally
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.760]   if I didn't have this now I would feel like I'm in the dark I now know when anybody comes and goes
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.000]   because you doesn't have to just ring the doorbell just the motion sensor so somebody comes up my
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.080]   my steps I know it I have video of it and I get a notice on my phone what somebody rings the doorbell
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.600]   I can I can talk to them actually even when they come up the steps I can talk to Mike say
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:19.680]   is that package for me leave it right there our Russell RIT guy was saying he uses his because
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:26.480]   he gets a deliveries every day and he just tells the delivery guy the passcode you know you can see
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.680]   there in a uniform you can see the truck so he knows it's real he tells him the passcode just
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:37.280]   open the door and leave it in there the ring video doorbell is awesome not just making your house
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:44.160]   safer but just giving you the it's it's the quantified front door giving you the information that is so

[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.840]   because it doesn't have the battery so it has to be for a wired doorbell it's also got 1080p video
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:06.720]   you also get an additional camera they call it the stick up cam you could because you could put

[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:49.440]   all around your house peace will peace reign in Europe with Google they got a good decision in
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:56.080]   France right France said being in Google are not liable they do not have to pull down search
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:03.680]   results that return bit torrent links that's the first good to set a Europe in a long time yeah
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:12.800]   you wrote a piece I got I got invited to write a piece on the European Commission vice president
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:20.000]   it's good to go to it and good who is in charge of the digital one market stuff that they're doing
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.360]   and so they asked me to write a kind of op-ed on his blogs Wow I did wow I was arguing because
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.200]   I think they know all the different viewpoint but I've just simply said it's time to move past
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:35.200]   war footing to business footing I think Europe is hurrying itself by this constant war and
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:43.680]   what's the response been none you know some Europeans on Twitter said link to it but some
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.360]   Europeans on Twitter also said you know Google fanboys what do you always say
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:53.920]   boy I think you're so right though I mean I think it makes sense you know I'm dealing with
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:59.520]   I think there's a chance to build an ideal relationship to negotiate yes you know be diplomats and I'm
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:05.040]   dealing with Latin American publishers who one came out of my favorite told the story on on
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.120]   twig one came to me some time ago and said you know we're thinking we're not happy with
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.440]   Google and Facebook we're thinking about doing a war like it in Germany and I said yeah it's been
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:19.520]   done why don't you try to develop a model relationship and have a mutual benefit and Google at least
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:25.040]   Google so far responded well and there's the start of good talks so Europe could find itself in a
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.880]   case where where the tech company is just going to write them off not in business terms but in
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.840]   terms of ever trying to go to them to do new things and collaborative things now Google meanwhile is
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:40.000]   very hopeful about the initial news initiative and their their development fund they're not
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:48.800]   happy when I call it a blackmail fund hey and good things are happening I think they can but but
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:54.640]   if the EU keeps spreading the laestong should threat across all of Europe which they're now
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:00.320]   basically threatening to do and constant antitrust and the right to be forgotten and all this stuff
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:04.960]   I think Europe is hurting itself so that's the point I made that was it we didn't mention
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:13.600]   Facebook stock results good earnings excellent Wall Street loves them the stock is soaring
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:21.440]   this these results came out today right right before show right before the show so I haven't
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:26.480]   had a chance to review them and I think they're now a billion was going to play in mobile users
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:31.920]   though she's the number I think they were at that already they were there was something I saw
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:40.000]   this craft is fascinating average revenue per user worldwide they make three dollars and 82 cents
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:48.480]   that's per quarter on a user but of course that's worldwide in the US and Canada 14 dollars a user
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:56.720]   oh my gosh you know 1.7 billion users well no yeah but yeah sorry no I'm just looking at
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.160]   multiply 3.82 times 1.7 and then you get a number yes they're doing okay
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:09.840]   1.7 billion active users they're pretty much I don't know if there's more growth available at
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:17.360]   this point oh yeah that's why they're trying to bring internet to more places yeah but I mean
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.400]   okay but but right now how many internet users are there
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:28.240]   in that but okay let's not even just look at okay they're nine or they're nine billion people
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.920]   yet in the world where are we somewhere like that but I think there's three billion in your
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:38.000]   you three billion internet users I think they want that to be six billion by 2020 and so obvious why
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:43.440]   because they're going to hit the ceiling well but then from those people you should be able to
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:48.240]   continue growth I mean they'll keep buying new platforms that provide a lot of activity and growth
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:37:01.280]   like you know Instagram and what's up what's up 6.44 billion in revenue 97 cents per share profit
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:09.120]   23 billion in cash oh that's nothing compared to Apple you know it's so funny because let's not
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.200]   compare it to Apple but you know it used to be that you know you have a couple billion cash
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:19.360]   you're doing pretty good but Apple set this new benchmark and now 23 billion all shoot but that's
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:29.840]   a lot of money it is it's important it's a it's a it's a fund for buying stuff well yeah and their
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.880]   stock is still great so they don't have to even really spend money yeah yeah it's been stock
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:40.960]   Facebook Live going great guns Washington Post has now a full-time more than one I think
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:47.200]   Facebook Live producer they're so one and only job to produce live content for
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:56.400]   Facebook they have two positions now of course Facebook is paying various publishers including
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.960]   the Washington Post oh so this might be Facebook money yeah I think it I think it's a good portion
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:06.960]   of it is wow oh so why not do it right Facebook if you want to get me some money I'll hire some
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:13.600]   people oh yeah I would do that the heartbeat to vote people to it yeah I also find it fascinating
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:21.280]   I was at a newspaper two days ago the need to publish natively to platforms and specialize in
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:26.000]   those platforms it's pretty another huge burden on these guys and what they do so you also have
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.240]   CNN is hiring a full-time I think full-time Snapchat producer yeah yep is Snapchat paying for that
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:41.600]   I don't think so no Snapchat does pay some organizations well if you're in discovery they do
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:47.760]   social publishing wait a minute this is the weekend Snapchat producer yes the week
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:54.400]   implying there is a weekday Snapchat producer there's another one though I didn't put up there's a
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:00.160]   trunk job you remember the trunk video we made fun yeah yeah there's a trunk job listing
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:07.840]   tribute is it the Chicago Tribune online like assembling other content job yeah it's just
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.840]   the army of bots
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:19.200]   chief plagiarizer it's amazing holy cow aggregator you think they'd have the pride at least to change
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:24.240]   the description a little bit they think it's no well they they do or where is it here okay here
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.200]   we go here we go here we go I got it um
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:36.400]   content specialist oh yeah oh that's I read a dedicated individual to join our car to
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:42.960]   development sport our news content harvesting robot harvesting harvesting robots that was it
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:49.760]   and classification and management systems harvest other people's content and turn it into separate
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:54.560]   the wheat from the chaff and turn it to a fine loaf of they are an industry leader in providing
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.120]   content solutions to the global information marketplace and with its innovative content
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:06.560]   ingestion classification and bermi burp delivery platforms as someone said it eats it up and it
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.800]   shoots it if you're making if you're making the metaphor to ingestion guess what
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:19.840]   the link up here sorry this is what we've come to it is Chicago Tribune is now trunk
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:27.040]   I just put it up on the um yeah we see it yeah it's wow so your job is to develop maintain and
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.400]   upgrade content harvesting robots develop and refine news ontology most news people I know
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:40.640]   don't know what ontology means what is that mean tagging in this context no tagging taxonomy
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.400]   yeah it's tagging oh it's okay well it's okay a content structure
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:52.080]   are they misusing the word ontology I think they are ontologically they are it's a branch of
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:58.400]   metaphysics dealing with the nature of being not taxonomy so oh I think you're right I think they
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.880]   are just you they're misusing the word no because ontologies when you talk about like remember
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:09.040]   the semantic web yeah so ontologies in the semantic web are classification systems I believe
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:16.720]   oh yeah information science in computer science and information science an ontology is a formal
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:22.320]   naming and definition of the types properties and interrelationships of the entities that really
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:28.560]   or fundamentally exist for a particular domain of discourse so it's a practical application of
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:37.520]   philosophical ontology plus a taxonomy let's not use the language as a brutal instrument of
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.760]   subjugation let's be inclusive fifth grade words please
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:52.720]   wow I can't even believe I brought up the semantic web the semantic web whatever happened to that
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.200]   I don't know let's ask a lot of timberers these dreams I think it's been I think it's there I
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:02.400]   think we're here we're some don't get Kevin Marx started on it that's all I can know no don't
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.880]   where is Kevin let me explain no I love Kevin
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:18.720]   um yahoo let's talk about it uh yeah 4.8 billion dollars not including yahoo japan or alan bob
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:24.320]   but the really the valuable parts of yahoo just the intellectual property the properties like flicker
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:35.120]   and omg.com are you sad? Stacy I'm just I'm just for rising buying content in your carriers this is
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:41.680]   their strategy to avoid kind of a dumb pipe you get new revenue streams from ad isn't that what
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:50.880]   Netflix and Comcast are doing they're becoming creators well nobody wants to be a dumb pipe right
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:58.000]   so I just it stresses me out that they're involved in in my my particular industry I guess media
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.320]   so I know well Verizon is not the most beloved company in America but neither is
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:11.360]   Comcast but once they have dreamworks they will be oh god dreamworks universal really
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:17.120]   are they buying dreamworks I know they I know Comcast owns universal uh Comcast put in a
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:23.360]   as a 3.8 billion dollar offer for cheap works um yeah that's right now I'm hanging my head
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:30.560]   mark this moment I'm going to defend Verizon what not Verizon mobile but Verizon I have files I
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:38.080]   love files right and so I I'm a huge fan customer it works well a few weeks ago two weeks ago on the
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:44.000]   show somebody mentioned maybe it was Twitter for some reason frontier it's about oh well did I
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   find out my poor parents in Florida I was moving them in the retirement home all we had was moved
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.480]   their phone from one place to another we are weak to do it frontier was awful my sister who is a
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:44:00.080]   Presbyterian minister was driven four and a half hours four and a half hours on the phone she was
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:05.280]   driven to tears and cursing not the cursies that uncommon for her but you know makes a
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:11.200]   story she's a minister Presbyterians a little more lenient they'll award you yeah so uh that I hit
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:17.280]   town they're still nowhere I go berserk I finally wrote an impassioned email I found the emails
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:23.440]   the executives here big mistake put it into the the uh VP of customer service or customer relations
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:27.840]   I sent her at 9.50 work credit I said her at 9.15 at night an impassion email my parents my mother's
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:33.120]   diabetic my father they can one of those deaf they can't move this is a lifeline and I'm out of town
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.720]   9.15 at night 9.30 she called me to work credit and you know the old bump it up to the president's
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:44.000]   office so you know do that takes more days they don't get it done they can't get it installed they
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.440]   don't show up and they're supposed to show up even with the president's office involved then
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:53.280]   they do install it and it works for 12 hours and then they moved it back to the old house
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:59.360]   and so I said that's it I've had it and I'm going on twitter and people are saying oh yeah they're
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:03.280]   the worst everybody hates them everybody hates them you should hear southern California
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:09.440]   oh hey then so then uh I want to I that's it they're in their in bright house territory which is
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.440]   just bought by charter um and so I said we're moving them to the bright house bright house
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.440]   couldn't get the number three days I had to get back on the horn to the president's office
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:23.280]   unbelievable I mean the VP was very nice but if your staff just can't do it somebody said in
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.800]   twitter oh get get a hold of Kevin Rose he had to go to the president's office to get anything
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:33.760]   really to yeah yeah but torch to to to to be let's to be so fair rising sold it's
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:39.040]   in southern florida franchises to frontier and the same thing happened make you wish
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:44.160]   for Verizon I have one request for rise and I'm now in files territory please Verizon please
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:49.840]   all is forgiven I will say nice things don't sound need a frontier please to be fair it may
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:55.600]   not be entirely frontiers fault Verizon may not have done the handoff very well you understand
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:01.840]   their data may not have there may have been a mismatch in the formatting the data may not
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:07.760]   you know it's it's same thing happened in southern California I'm not I don't know who to blame
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:15.040]   and I hate to defend Verizon so it'd be in frontier neither one frontier or Verizon but we
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:20.880]   don't know where the where the when you have a handoff it could be either side that could have
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:26.560]   caused I don't know how long ago the handoff was uh Verizon bought or sold to frontier in like
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:34.160]   2008 2008 yeah hold on yeah hold on oh okay no no this is this is more recent because this
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.160]   transfer happened for fire from phios to frontier in southern California about two months ago
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:45.680]   oh I suspect it's related or it's the same time yeah they did a big package I think they added
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:50.400]   to it in one of their yeah it's it's been an ongoing thing because remember we talked a little
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:58.880]   bit about frontier buying Verizon's uh phios installation anyway just so yeah so here's a story
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:03.680]   at the Tampa Bay Times from from April can frontier regroup after its bundled Verizon
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:09.040]   phios take over or will this get ugly give me the answer to that question phial it's ugly
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:16.720]   ugly so Marissa Meyer what oh I was seeing there's a consumerist
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.960]   yes from actually 2016 so yes no this is this is a nightmare in southern California because I get
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:30.960]   I'm on the radio down there I get a lot of calls um Marissa Meyer says to yahoo's anyway I'm not going
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:39.120]   anywhere what that's not true no there'll be a time 50 million what was it was a 51 million
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:44.320]   dollars uh golden perish she's no come on planning to stay till the end of the month maybe
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.720]   well when's the actual closing I done just wouldn't she have to stay to the closing yeah I should stay
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:53.200]   to the closing well when's the closing I think the closing isn't until like 2017 because
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:58.080]   there is I presume there's got to be regulatory but maybe not they're not quite in the same business
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:04.560]   promise well they are of course Verizon owns AOL so maybe there is an issue it looks I mean the
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:09.840]   joke Verizon looks like a collector of old internet properties now like they're buying they're
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:16.080]   snapping them up you know the LA Times had a story about Verizon getting some silicon valley real estate
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:21.680]   with this deal with the yahoo so I thought that was kind of interesting I was like oh Verizon I
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:27.120]   mean they've got they've got stuff but it says the real estate is including oh I thought it wasn't
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:31.040]   gonna be interesting well you know what is for what does yahoo need with a campus
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:37.440]   Marissa Meyer says she couldn't be more proud couldn't be more proud of her achievements
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.240]   at yahoo you know I'm still gonna defend her at least that that she had an impossible job
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.080]   utterly impossible but okay I don't know what I would
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.760]   the test would you be would you be touting the great job you did though
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:56.400]   I think her point is compared to what it was without her you know her her what was that what was that
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:01.840]   the mobile you tripled the mobile base 600 million monthly active users
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.400]   generated a billion dollars of mobile advertising in the year gone by
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:12.000]   invested in and built our mobile video native and social businesses from nothing in 2011
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:19.840]   to 1.6 billion in gap she leaves out you know didn't really bought tumblr didn't really make
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:25.360]   anything of that really weren't able to turn around yahoo mail or flicker the kind of jewels in the
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:30.960]   yahoo crown in any significant way and really the most of the value in yahoo came from their
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:38.240]   prescient or maybe just lucky acquisition of stake in alway boba but the big mistakes that
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:43.280]   yahoo were made before her tenure right now no you're i agree with you i had a reverse off she
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:48.160]   you know and we even said at the time she must have seen this as a as a challenge
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:53.920]   and and a worthy you know thing to sink her teeth into yeah if you're gonna criticize
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.760]   if anything that's the hubris of thinking that you could fix yahoo but why not she's got nothing to
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:04.080]   lose yeah and that's you know that's when women's CEOs are often brought in it's when the company is
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:09.840]   like true just nothing can be done so you're like really that's not when you bring in chainsaw
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:17.520]   al done lap these are the ones you want to have turn around but think about it i mean there's
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:22.240]   megalithman in ebay she did actually really well um oh it's interesting that's interesting
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:29.680]   uh sorry megalithman at hp hp and then uh that was not great carly fierina at hp
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:35.120]   well she was she was different i'm just thinking of companies that are but Meg did go to ebay
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:41.520]   later right she said ebay now isn't she she had ebay now yeah so i was thinking about her at hp
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:46.560]   right that was just an untenable position hps another company that just was unmanageable
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.360]   i just put both a link up marissa i think really do your points dacey an important point
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:57.040]   called out media for the sexist coverage that she had to suffer really uh and then others yeah so
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:03.600]   you really really run down really i mean look i believe me i i see sexism everywhere and i and i'm
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:09.920]   not a supporter of it but i thought she got pretty intentionally pretty even-handed coverage
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:16.480]   uh i'm trying to be gender blind and believe tech is a gender neutral zone but do think there has
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:21.200]   been gender charged reporting she told the financial times okay we all see the things that play
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   that only plague women leaders like articles that focus on their appearance like hillary clinton
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:30.720]   sporting a new pantsuit right i think all women are aware of that i had hoped in 2015-2016 i would
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:36.960]   see fewer articles like that it's a shame if she were a man though i think much of the criticism
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:41.840]   would be exactly the same i mean if a guy in there didn't turn it around they wouldn't call it a
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:48.800]   shopping spree necessarily okay you're right i mean okay i admit that yeah that's probably not the
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:55.280]   right phrase to use but i i also think it's look gerry gerry yang didn't turn around either
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.680]   no and i don't think he was treated any better than marissa mire was
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:05.840]   yeah but there's a little bit of a mistake go ahead go i was going to say a double standard like
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:11.040]   you got to be you got to work twice as hard and twice as good um she's going to go be raked over
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:17.120]   the coals far more than gerry gerry sanders gerry yang was for freaking not selling to microsoft
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:21.760]   right yeah i think so i put it as i want to brag about one of my students one of my brilliant
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:27.760]   graduates named jenny evens who's at courts who did i think a brilliant job about talking about um
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.400]   the headlines hillary clinton's husband wore a fetching pantsuit to honor her nomination oh that's
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:39.280]   terrible no it was really done it was really fetching pantsuit oh i see it's a parody it's a parody
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:43.920]   okay all women are covered no i that sounds like a headline you would see frankly i thought it was
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:48.480]   a real headline yeah so it's on courts and it's short and it's i think it's i put the link up on there
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:56.400]   it's really well done props to jenny yeah i like the uh the fake hillary clinton medium post did you
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:02.720]   see that oh yes you can't you can't show it on your on your area it's so profane that i can't but it was
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:09.760]   it was hilarious freaking awesome i've been f-ing doing my homework for 30 years let me remind you
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:18.640]   effers who i am what the f is your problem america i'm hillary god damn clinton i also noted that it
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:23.520]   originally said hillary clinton and now it says larry clinton parrot oh it didn't say uh parody
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:28.800]   yeah so i'm glad i mean this is this an immediate was apparently stepping in and good it should say
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:36.960]   parody it doesn't it doesn't diminish it in any way to say parody it resolves a a momentary that
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:42.720]   would only be momentary confusion as soon as you start reading it you go oh it's obviously a parody
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:49.280]   that's not her yeah although that i bet if you got hillary clinton drinking this is yeah talk to her
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:54.080]   about it for real i'm sure that's a similar she's got a similar that's why it's funny because you know
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:54:00.320]   this is what she's in so i'm so jealous my my son jake met hillary in new hampshire and actually
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:05.600]   had a conversation he worked on our campaign or campaign my sister the reverend jarvis just got
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:12.160]   invited to a reception with the clergy in philadelphia for this hillary on friday i'm jealous as hell yeah
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.560]   i'm never going to get an invitation now that i'm known as a sextice pig it's over for me but
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:24.160]   i'm voting for uh this is my favorite one i've been preparing my whole life for this job
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:30.000]   effing job so stop making me dab on ellen and just give me an effing chance already
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:36.800]   and there's a picture of her on ellen learning how to dab i guess that's a dance the kids dance
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:44.960]   and it says effing kill me but we make we make politicians do sillier and sillier things hey bill
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:52.080]   clinton played the saxophone on our cnio so what wasn't obama on that show where you survive in
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:59.120]   the wild or something no it was what's wrong why is he on a yes he's on some reality show recently
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:05.120]   thought don't you have something better to do he's been on like late night television and
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:10.880]   flotis has done carpool karaoke and billy eichmann and but flotis is a little different
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:17.200]   obama did between two ferns that was awesome by the way did he do did he do sign felt no
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:22.000]   he did something where he had a drive around he did he did mark marin carter sir did he do
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:28.400]   sign film yeah he did mark marin yeah he did because he had that great corvette yeah he wouldn't do
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:32.560]   one thing i thought he did do running wild with bear grills oh he did so that's the one thing he
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:38.080]   did there was only one thing he wouldn't do he didn't want to get too wild well the very fact
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:43.360]   that he was on that show was bizarre especially since he wasn't running for office i understand
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:49.280]   when you're running for office you kiss the babies but now he's in fwtf mode yeah clearly
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:56.080]   it seems like there were more important things to do than run around with bear grills yeah that's
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:02.160]   right did you watch the flotis car carpool karaoke no i have watched everything star
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:07.520]   it's amazing and cordon is great it's a terrible show i tried to watch a show and it's an awful
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:12.800]   show but you see they've just had a spinoff spinoff the carpool karaoke is very very good they're
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:19.680]   spinning off that yeah with other drivers oh no no that only works because of james cordon exactly
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:28.160]   yeah i hate tv i hate tv so she wasn't even in that wasn't james cordon doing it
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:32.720]   with it was it was it was it was this case i would say they're they just announced after that a spinoff
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:39.680]   okay i think i'll be in on air i mean on on web spinoff i i was up to your favorite youtube
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:47.680]   stars doing carpool karaoke with no oh baby oh baby oh baby you could do it oh or who was that
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:53.840]   something big cheddar you could do carpool karaoke in your tesla yes yes yes did you see i did i
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:57:01.840]   talk about the bill gates uh interview with um was it nyl stevenson with the in his tesla did i
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:07.760]   show you that the most awkward did i not do this yes it was very awkward yes you'll stevenson the
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:16.480]   author yeah that's hilarious it was it was so unintentionally painful and it's in his model x
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:23.440]   it's in the gates model x and uh and they did it in 360 degree because it wouldn't be enough just
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:29.600]   to be talking to but the the thing that was awkward was like the the whole thing was awkward as hell it
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:33.840]   was just really weird so he just shows you it does it's a flattering camera angle right there
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:40.880]   well and never it's not no wide angle not good uh yeah bill apparently really enjoyed seven eves
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:50.560]   the most recent novel and i did too it's very good um for a man um let's see i'm just going to add that
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:56.000]   from now on for a man just to kind of balance things out i'll i'll sort of keep you honest
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:05.920]   for a white male that's pretty surprisingly good um uh Twitter's gonna not only stream uh football
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:12.000]   they get an mlb major league baseball and an hl hockey twitter's becoming the go-to sports leader
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.120]   right no why would you watch it they just promoted now watch the convention so i clicked on it on
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:25.600]   twitter and it's cbsn yeah and it says we'll resume in a hundred seconds thank you because we're in a
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:35.120]   commercial yeah well but that's like what mlb does on mlb.com yeah i mean stack time is it for people
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:40.480]   like you stacey who just don't own a tv and so you want to watch tv on twitter i just really don't
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:45.520]   understand it i don't understand i own a tv i just don't have cable right um and i don't watch
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:50.720]   anything but if you wanted to watch uh you know sports you have to watch a twitter i would chromecast
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:58.640]   it oh if i wanted to watch it on twitter okay so so leon could do this on my chromebook
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:05.600]   or you're on a real machine there right yes google omnitone surround sound project i couldn't get the
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:11.520]   demo working oh i don't have flash but let me see oh maybe it's flash no i think it was a
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:19.280]   so this is not flash uh uh where can i see a lot of articles about it but i actually want the
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:24.880]   it's all it's on the it's on the rundown and there's a link to oh okay do i have to wear my it's web
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:33.440]   based vr that's the thing is web based do i have to wear my helmet i don't think so spatial audio
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:40.400]   oh yeah so the idea yeah this is kind of been under i think underplayed in vr is you really
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:46.080]   good audio makes a big difference it needs to be as 300 as as immersive as the video
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:53.520]   exactly my my you remember Sarah Bartlett our dean her son has made this his specialty all right
[00:59:53.520 --> 01:00:00.720]   it's brilliant everybody put on your headphones and which one we should we do förtsa in previsita
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:06.560]   or resonance let's be classy let's let's both they're both classy all right drag the screen to
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:15.520]   hear the spatial audio effect plus play to play the video okay oh oh now it's coming from the right
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:22.320]   now it's coming from the left oh this is like those um surround sound ths surround sound yeah
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:29.840]   yeah so it's like eight simulated speakers that's kind of fun oh my god now we're looking at
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:37.360]   someone's veteran okay so he's in front of us i'm gonna move it behind us she had she hit
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.840]   boy she should have really picked up before she did this
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.360]   now she's behind us can you tell she's behind us can you tell can you tell he's behind us
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.480]   can you tell he's in front of us can you tell he's not made his bed
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:03.680]   can you since you're there this is terrible is this really what they thought
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:11.920]   oh you're not getting in stereo it's working for me oh he's asking does it doesn't work for you
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:19.760]   you're not getting in stereo it's not behind you now i have one earplink it's totally working
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:26.080]   it is it is working it's totally working oh now he's in a church suddenly the bed got made
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:35.600]   uh this is pretty cool so this is exactly what immersive media needs to do which is
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.120]   come from now we're in a burnout warehouse with graffiti on the wall okay it's best to
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.600]   settle let's go back to the gallery because i'm i'm not i'm not getting this man let's go the
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:50.160]   first time paravista this is cool now this definitely works if
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:56.080]   hey go to google chrome dot github dot io slash omnitone
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:07.120]   this is vr playhouse i like this music
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:15.200]   so she now she's singing she's in front of us now she's tell me where she is
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:21.040]   can you tell she's on the left now she's behind us
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:32.960]   this should work with stereo this is does not require more than a stereo i can't remember do we
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.080]   put this out as a stereo podcast i think we do i think we were gonna we were gonna start doing it
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.240]   you could find out more ear plug-ins so i'm yeah you're not yeah google open source blog
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:48.400]   yeah right it worked so it does i wonder if it works if you like chrome cast that to
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:54.240]   an actual surround sound system if it plays that way well the point i would guess is that is for
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:01.680]   vr headset using using stereo headphones and modern imaging capabilities you can simulate
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:07.040]   surround with only two speakers right without having other channels it's kind of like doppler
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:13.600]   is doppler doing something like that no they're doing no sorry not do it's doppler but no dopplers
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:21.200]   a startup that got 24 million but they're actually doing pulling out noise cancellation for specific
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.080]   noises like when you're when you're talking or listening to someone on a conference call and
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:36.400]   you're using your headset they actually filter out like sirens and everything else and anyway nice
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.320]   different technology but very cool a lot of this is computer technology using
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:47.840]   yes yes it's it's simulating these effects and doing quite a good job because hey computers
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:53.280]   they're smart they're getting there they're getting there they're not getting much smarter
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:00.320]   if we talk about Moore's law oh is Moore's law being broken again again they're saying they're saying
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:08.400]   we've gotten till 2021 oh no can i point out they said they said we would only have till 2010
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:17.600]   a few years ago so um it we are but it will live low what but it will live on transistors will
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:26.080]   stop shrinking but Moore's law will live on because we have new technologies 3d stacking cooling there's
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:31.120]   quantum tunneling that's really interesting i saw a company that is doing a new transistor
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:40.320]   based on what was it quantum tunneling and something else and then did you guys see in gadget had a
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:50.720]   story about atom scale storage i don't know if y'all saw that the and that's where the original
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:56.000]   concerns about Moore's law even more him scored more himself said we're at some point and we are
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.280]   very close to this we're now down to i think 14 nanometer i think we're at 11 on certain
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:08.160]   memory chips so at some point quantum effects become an issue and you can't go any smaller oh if
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.480]   you want to talk about leakage and quantum effects i am your girl are you the queen of leakage really
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:19.120]   the queen of leakage yes that depends what do you mean stacey hagan botham
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:25.440]   how did you become how did you become an expert in all this um i covered chip manufacturing
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:33.120]   for a while kidding wow so so tell us about quantum effects do they not become a problem as you get
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:38.080]   down to eight or nine nanometers no there's still a problem it becomes more expensive and you
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:45.760]   have to use these crazy things like doping uh and you you've got fin-fat technologies where you
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:52.800]   you create like uh what's the word i'm looking for three d transistors or you you kind of not
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.520]   stack the actual chips but you create different shapes on the transistor but the whole point is
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.840]   as you move your transistors closer together to cram more of them on a chip
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:09.760]   electricity that you need to conduct the signals it starts you can't control it as well and we're
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.560]   talking at widths that are let's see what is it ten nanometers is like a thousand
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:20.400]   is it like one one thousandth of a human hair i mean this is ridiculously small
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.840]   ten nanometers according to scott in the chat scott micha on the chair and there you go
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:33.440]   18 to 20 atoms there you go that's tiny that's tiny that's that's what we're talking about so
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:38.400]   things just get crazy it becomes much more expensive your yields go down because these things aren't
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:45.840]   gonna be you know you can't manufacture them in a way that's consistent um and there's also the idea
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:53.360]   that outside of storage where there's you could do a lot of cool stuff you may not need that many
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:58.560]   transistors and the processing power it may be better to like split it up over different
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:04.080]   chips there's all kinds of other kind of technologies we're looking at so the while we ran into really
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:10.560]   before that was really the clock wall that we really weren't able to get past four gigahertz
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.800]   and processors reliably and intel was kind of surprised by that that was the whole
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:21.920]   itanium fiasco and i think uh that that was intel's response was well okay fine we'll just give you
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:25.920]   four of them or eight of them or twelve of them or twenty of them or thirty of them or whatever
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:33.840]   and and now of course intel's being eclipsed by arm which is is not clock speeds are slower
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:39.920]   um but there but there are other techniques being used uh that improve performance and i
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:45.280]   think i think you're right Stacey i think we're performance isn't really the issue for most of
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:50.400]   the stuff we do right now there are other issues like power consumption yeah thanks to
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.520]   thanks to virtualization you can actually split up a job pretty easily among many cores i think
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:01.200]   we talked about this last week anyway um no i don't think we did it must have been you and Tofa
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:07.360]   i must have been just doing something else so once you've got sorry virtualization you're doing
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.840]   you've got this massive server that's doing like dozens of small jobs so you can actually split
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.920]   that up between different cores and that was why arm thought they were going to have a bit play
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:22.240]   in the server space they oh we did talk about that part yes you're right yeah yeah so and they've
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:28.400]   done a bunch of things like in containers actually kind of now that we're all talking about you know
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:35.280]   various containers that actually changes it a little bit yeah dock or kubernetes um anyway
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:41.280]   and now pokemon go uses kubernetes we think by the way do we is that why it doesn't work in
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:46.720]   groupless class i think the issue is not so that's actually a good example of really where you run
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:55.680]   into problems scaling is not processor speed but uh transactions and uh and handoffs and so um
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.880]   that's that we we don't know nobody's talking but the the thought is that that's one of the
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.840]   problems pokemon goes having is it's got all these transactions between maps and o-auth and and
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.080]   and it's just a very complex system and that's why it's so difficult to scale it
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:15.280]   you can't just throw more servers at that because you got to you got all these handoffs and there's
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:20.000]   bottlenecks um we had a great segment on uh the new screensavers on saturday with
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.080]   nobody in the know but people who work with scaling servers and things like that was very
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:30.080]   interesting adam's scale storage that you were just talking about 62 terabytes per square inch
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.400]   yes and less stress right now before people get too excited this is research level this is not
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:41.280]   something you can buy but isn't it amazing i mean we've seen this i mean i thought uh i remember
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:49.120]   saying on the on the radio that oh you won't be using a hard drive in the year 2010 because hard
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.640]   drive i think it was actually the year 2000 hard drives will be eclipsed by some other form of us
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:00.880]   3d storage or solid state storage hard drives went much farther than we thought and now i think
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.520]   we're looking at solid state storage that can go much much farther than we thought it's really
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:11.280]   impressive uh these technologies we find more and more ways to squeak up performance and
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:18.560]   it's just it's really impressive density they're using they're they're coding the data using a
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:24.960]   scanning tunneling electron microscope to shuffle chlorine atoms on the surface of copper
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:32.160]   creating data blocks where qr style code markers indicate location and whether or not they're in
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:38.880]   good condition this is how you get 500 times the density of the best hard drives what what
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:46.240]   you could buy at 10 terabyte hard drive now for a few hundred dollars but imagine if you have that
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:53.760]   storage on your phone or imagine if you i mean you would have to rewrite you would have to rewrite
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.000]   your coding and programming language because you'd have nearly infinite storage right um
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.960]   it's kind of mind-boggling and speaking of quantum tunneling which oh my god we were yes
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:16.240]   there's a company called amorphics amor p h y x and they filed for a patent that basically
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:22.800]   let's see if i can do this i was reading about this and i was just like what it replaces the
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:31.760]   semiconductor base transistor with something else um it's it's the amorphous metal hot electron
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:38.000]   transistor so that's what their patents filed for and again they're using quantum tunneling too
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:47.040]   to create these new types of transistors um so i have i have many questions for them and i
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:53.040]   want to know way more about this because it looks fascinating we are in a situation though where
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:01.760]   this top technology isn't we can't even understand it let alone recreate it and if the handful of
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:05.840]   people that understand it and make it disappeared we'd really be deep doo-doo
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:12.400]   well think about i mean like we've had CMOS for god how many years yeah was it 19
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:19.840]   long time yeah so i mean if you if we can standardize around something else and that's a big if
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:27.920]   since there's so many options out there um that'll be i mean it'll be a new generation and we'll
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:33.200]   we'll get the basics will be down and then the fun stuff will be all the software and how to like
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:38.320]   optimize it and all that great stuff but first we have to get there and everything will be
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:42.640]   have to kept cold i don't know if you notice that but quantum radiators need to be kept in like
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:47.520]   superconducting yeah yeah and then these quantum tunneling the making of these crazy
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:55.680]   chlorine whatever things they can only operate at like negative 77 is it celsius or fahrenheit
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:02.560]   let's see it's cold at that point it doesn't matter celsius and fahrenheit coincide at 40 so
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:10.240]   uh 77 kelvin kelvin that's really cold negative three kelvin starts at that starts at absolute
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:15.680]   zero so that's really cold that's almost absolute zero all right so yeah these are these are made
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:22.720]   in very specialized places did you know the fisherman's worth area in san francisco has 70
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:30.320]   pokey stops each of them tomorrow night each of them will have an active lore on it between six and
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:37.600]   nine means that this is the one place in san francisco you do not want to go tomorrow night it will be
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:44.960]   swarming with pokémon go fanatics thousands of them and i'll tell you we have a park with three
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.800]   lures on it and you can barely move so this is going to be nuts
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:54.560]   nuts from one of the different london who was with his teenage son in the south of england on
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.800]   vacation to go to the beach and the kid got all the pokémon their word to be had around and
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:06.080]   begged to go back to london yeah hashtag warff poké night if that becomes trending on twitter you'll
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.360]   know is that i have not i saw people out on the streets of new york right after the start of
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.400]   doing pokemon i have not seen it for a week at all what i think it's i know it's over in new york
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.280]   i think we're we're the cool place we've reached poké peak peak poké
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:27.440]   oh geez no well we'll see what happens tomorrow night at the fisherman's worth
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:36.400]   it's the warff's poké night six to nine p.m. 75 pokey stops with active lures it'll be him and
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.040]   you know who's sponsoring this the local businesses why because they're going to attract thousands of
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.480]   people to have drinks have something to eat through a little shopping
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:49.760]   pierce 39 to gird le square and of course it's free
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:56.160]   wow actually i'm tempted i want to go down i'd like to see that
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:04.880]   uh yeah yeah yeah all right i think uh anything else you guys want to talk about before we get to
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:09.920]   the picks of the week i want to leave time for that because stacy's got something extra special
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.520]   and so do i have an unboxing something came today in the mail
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:22.800]   no i just i'm just curious about your opinion and steve's opinion about the the kremlin and wicky
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:30.080]   leaks uh you know i we talked a little bit about it yesterday but it this the news continues to
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:36.560]   develop on that one and it seems very clear at this point uh that the russians uh did it do the
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:44.000]   did hack the dncs servers um i mean even the fbi and law you know national enforcement is saying that
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.400]   the uh other thing that i found interesting was assage who had i didn't know this but in an interview
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:56.720]   a couple of months ago said i have some dynamite stuff uh but i'm holding on to it to an appropriate
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:04.800]   time and has now admitted that he did time the release for the days before the democratic convention
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:11.200]   because for reasons i don't quite understand assage well i understand why he doesn't like clinton
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:17.680]   but uh yeah he's he he apparently wants to throw the election and clinton has said i think that
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:24.640]   assage should be persecuted for wicky leaks which i disagree with but uh maybe there's more to it
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:30.960]   than that she was the head of the state department yeah well she should be saying that that's her
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:35.920]   job to say that and i and uh and i on the other hand think that wicky leaks is a good thing we wouldn't
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:43.360]   know about uh a lot of uh nefarious activity including the Panama papers yes but there's a story in
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.360]   and fast companies saying that wicky leaks has gone from whistleblower to to weapon well that's
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:52.000]   clear it's being weapon like simply yeah if it is used selectively he needs to be assaged as a
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.200]   agenda yeah that's right that's a very different matter i agree i agree wicky leaks should be or
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.960]   trump's agenda or rubber's agenda they shouldn't be holding back material to time it to have the
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:06.000]   most explosive uh exactly what they complained the new york times did that held it back to the
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.920]   opposite right uh the the original um unwarranted search uh phone record story that they held it back
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.520]   and they have to have government for a different reason well then assages guilty of the same exact
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:23.760]   same thing right oh scooter x is reminding us about the family library you say you can't get it to
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.680]   work jenn well i guess it's gonna roll out of the eye i tried to and it wouldn't let me
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:30.240]   it said but it said ominously like you can't have this
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:38.800]   your family is too big so you could share your google play purchases and that includes apps but
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:46.480]   also tv and movies with others up to six family members and i don't think they they check the
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:53.040]   bloodline so it's really up to six at least six people um across the place they take the x-girl
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:59.600]   friend out right watch and so say once i have 23 and me totally integrated then boom
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:08.080]   then they have genetic information uh google is just kicking off the official rollout to
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:13.200]   australia brazil canada france germany ireland italy japan mexico newzielin the uk and the u s
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:19.760]   but it's going to be staged as always um so i have uh i have the fifteen dollar family plan
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:27.200]   but do so you do have to have that right jeff uh no that's only no i think for the things that i
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:34.320]   have bought wow i bought long no additional cost wow yes then i put the wrong link in there darn
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:42.160]   wow okay so that's interest so i have the music family plan but this is come this is kind of
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:46.080]   different just get started with family library well i should try this you'll access a new setting in
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:52.400]   the place door where you could figure one person as the family manager and i had the other members
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:57.280]   the family manager should be an adult in the family who's responsible for adding removing
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:02.240]   members this is how apple does it as well uh some it's because it's based on somebody's account
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.600]   they'll also enter in the payment information where family purchases
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:11.200]   we'll be able to share that i can share everything i buy but if jake buys something i won't get that
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:17.040]   buy no no every member's purchase will be shared with everyone else oh but that could be terrible
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:24.080]   well but there's the option to selectively share it so uh parental controls i don't know if it's that
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:31.440]   um i guess i don't because i can do that with amazon with my daughter's kindle using kindle free time
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:36.320]   right i can throw movies that we've bought and all this other stuff on her kindle
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.600]   i'm just trying to think of analogy but god there's such a pain i'd hate to be the like i'm already
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:48.800]   the network yeah the process right now in the uh on the apple requires it's it really is a pain
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:54.240]   and it's periodically members of my family will have to call me up and say what are the last four
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.800]   digits of the credit card number that you used like i'm gonna share like the
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.800]   wait a second wait a second wait a second here no hold on this problem
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.000]   select a credit card as the family payment method yes family library and play music family plan
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.400]   requires a shared payment method right does that mean that my kids can't then buy things on their
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:19.120]   own with their own money it all has oh that's interesting i wouldn't want that no it'll it'll
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:25.680]   uh okay you can go to play dot google dot com slash store slash family slash create thank you scooter x

[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:12.000]   no because my play stuff is all stuck in the time when you couldn't use apps with play
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.680]   i am stuck in a bifurcated world where all of the things i purchased are in my gmail account when
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:26.000]   i'd rather my apps account but i can't you cannot move things over oh unless oh unless i can
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:33.600]   invite myself in my apps account into my family thing and maybe then i can use oh yeah you could
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:43.120]   that's one of the accounts maybe huh i just want to purchase with my gmail account but i can play
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:49.760]   with my apps account cool see what you've done to me google this is how i spend my days and nights
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:55.680]   yeah yeah if you it stays here you sign it up um no i was actually playing with
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.400]   prisma on the is that awesome isn't that awesome yes but it's it's not great on the
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.360]   android it's slow it's slow or it doesn't finish sometimes right it's slow and it crashes all the
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:11.760]   time yeah i don't know if that's because so many people are using it now or
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:19.680]   it 10 million downloads in ios it's an amazing really wonderful app it's fun yeah i've been
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:26.800]   turning my pictures into art and it's you know it's kind of like a filter but it's better i think
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:33.840]   because it's like it's doing some sort of ai style it's it's painting it in the style of a
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:41.760]   certain artist in some of them it's like repainting it right it's wild yeah does anybody have the google
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:48.160]   beta version of the google app on their uh on their android device because it's got some new
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.920]   commands including i like this an eta command so when you get in your car and it pairs to your
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:59.520]   bluetooth you'll get you can get an eta notification i don't know how i don't know how it knows where
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:05.040]   you're going maybe based on your uh calendar or yeah yeah your calendar yeah that's kind of cool
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:12.880]   yeah i like how my calendar pops up in my my car um from yeah that's weird oh it's nice it's
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.760]   nice i guess yeah and then if you hit your address where you're going it'll it'll navigate to it
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.600]   i was my theory is that that was why i did that so you could see oh i have an appointment and if
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:27.200]   there's an address and then appointment i can just have it automatically go to the navigation cool
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:31.440]   i thought that might happen all right so i just invited myself to it
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:39.520]   no you didn't invite yourself you invited your other account to it my other self yeah very confusing
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:43.680]   you're you're on your consumer account you're inviting your google for work account and there

[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:15.920]   no this is zte chinese phone company oh and uh they have released kind of like one plus one plus
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:24.000]   a four hundred dollar flagship style android phone this is the axon seven
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.040]   and uh i pre-ordered it online and i just came today so
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:34.320]   does this come with chinese government stupid well i'm trying to remember but i
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:39.120]   pretty sure zte was one of the companies that the department of commerce said the american
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:45.280]   company shouldn't have anything to do with um you know who you know who knows everybody's snooping
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:52.960]   on everybody else right um it's a nice box these chinese companies would love to wah
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:59.920]   way and and zte and uh what's the one hugha barra shall me shall me shall me shall me
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:03.600]   would love to get one of the things they said that i was interested in is the front-facing
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:09.120]   speakers uh they said sounded quite good i don't remember who they is oh it's pretty
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:15.120]   it's the end yeah every phone looks the same these days though don't that does yeah
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:22.160]   what what size does that screen uh looks like very similar to the one effect so similar to the one
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:27.520]   plus one that i don't know if i'll be able to tell the difference oh so that's five i think five
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:35.440]   point two it's not super big uh headphones uh sim good i can have change the sim let's see uh
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:42.880]   type c looks like it comes with some sort of type c adapter oh that's a good idea micro usb uh
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:49.040]   to type c that's like oh that's like i'd buy it for that yeah i would too yeah i have quite a few of
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:55.680]   those now i do like type c i'm i'm all type c let's turn out see see what it looks like uh four
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.640]   hundred dollars um that's pretty pretty it looks like a pretty good screen here
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:09.760]   so this is the zte axon and uh you can get it directly online it's unlocked you know one of the
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:16.560]   big questions that and i think this is the first time they've sold a phone in uh in the u.s
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:24.880]   one of the questions of course is is how pure and android it'll be and more importantly really for
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:32.160]   me whether they'll um do those updates because if you don't do the google security updates
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:39.440]   20 megapixel camera optical image stabilization 4k video 240 frames per second slow motion
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.920]   everything's got to do that now aluminum oh oh that speaker does sound kind of good
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:53.280]   um full metal jacket i love the fingerprint reader on the back that's always the way to do it right
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:58.960]   all i'll carry this around it's pretty it's a little heavier than the one plus three it reminds me a
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:08.400]   lot of the one plus three in the nfc um it's got a i think it's got a very good deck it looks like
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:14.320]   for audio they're really focusing on audio dual noise suppression likes four gigs ram 64 gigs
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:23.760]   rom to snap dragon eight 20 that's a good ship it's the best i was like whoo this is this is flagship
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:33.440]   right flagship quality uh at 400 bucks 32 50 milliamp hour battery um let's see we shall see
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:39.760]   oh dual sim of course and SD card support that's nice that is nice that's one thing that uh is
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:46.080]   missing on the one plus three and they're claiming good battery life quick charge 3.0 that's another
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:51.360]   thing one plus three has that is remarkable you were talking about that i think stacy half an hour
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:31:01.040]   yeah it's amazing yes and i guess they say um well sound cameras performing that's good i mean
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:07.600]   i when it really is to me what this points up is the challenge apples facing in this market because
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:14.480]   they're and and sam's on actually as well twice as much do you get twice as much phone i don't think so
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:22.400]   uh it's larger it fits in fewer of my pockets yeah i think this is i think this is big enough
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:29.280]   yeah off to some cards in is there a screen protector on here must be because this does not
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:34.800]   look good yeah there it is there we go that's better all right so i'm not going to skip this
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:41.600]   yeah it's i wouldn't say a great screen it must it looks IPS not all led but uh 400 bucks
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:47.600]   i shall have a full review uh sometime in the next week or so usually like to spend a week with
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:51.600]   a phone at least to get the uh you know it's interesting they are using some pretty good
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:55.520]   decks in this it looks like it's got high res playback and all that which is kind of interesting
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:00.960]   96 what do you lose by having to switch phones every every three weeks you know with android not
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:06.880]   much not much really no that's the beauty of android because uh i just uh you know i lose the
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:11.600]   hour it takes to download or two that takes to download all the apps again but i always back up
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:16.800]   to google so it's got all my it's got everything in it and then uh i let it download the apps and
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:21.280]   then i use one of the reasons i use nova launchers because i can save my desktop setup this is the
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:26.000]   biggest pain on iPhones because you have to go through there's it's no easy way to get your desktop
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.920]   setup back but on android i just download my desktop setup in the nova launcher and i'm
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:37.360]   it looks exactly the same in two hours this will be in you know indistinguishable from the
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.000]   from every other android phone i use and that makes it a lot easier
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:48.720]   anyway that's mine what let's let's get a number then we'll let stacy show us hers
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:52.880]   uh what should i do what you're doing okay so this one is all right
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:33:00.160]   one of these stupid run run downs on the 13 craziest google patents most of which we've heard about
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:04.000]   most of which we know but there's a few ones i didn't know in there i thought we're amusing
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.960]   uh now you're gonna find the darn by the way i think this actually is an OLED screen now that i
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:18.240]   look at it uh it's looking very nice yeah wow go ahead no that's okay so the one that one i didn't
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:24.480]   know about was tattoos to 2012 and that too you can patent a tattoo that includes a microphone
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:33.520]   and a light detector on your neck i don't why would you want a lie detector uh i think you put
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:38.640]   them on somebody else when they're sleeping uh-huh the other one is a another 2002 the portable
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:43.120]   fan that would attach to your body and spray fragrance when it detects that you're exerting
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:51.200]   yourself to cover up your body that's hysterical wow they should if they revamp that for mosquito
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:57.760]   repellent with zika that'd be that'd be great except off i think cells one so they really there's
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:03.840]   special zika the zika uh sprits i i don't they sell a spritzer i don't know if it's a mosquito
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:10.560]   or a limbic athletes that that needs more than just repelling mosquitoes you see if you have
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:16.800]   does support people have to be in on the water god help them oh god that water does not look clean
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:23.520]   oh it's always so not clean it is oh it's like a super fun sight i mean it's it's you're swimming
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:29.280]   in effluent it's gross yeah it's really awful i don't blame the athletes who are saying never mind
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:34.480]   never mind i'll skip this one i mean i'm going to Rio after the olympics but i think i'm gonna go
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:40.880]   to the water uh but then there's there's usually there's a nest patterned with all kinds of
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.360]   sensors on the crib which i think is nice yeah hey it's a good and i've talked about that a nest
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:50.800]   crib that's a great name i'd buy a crib that's a nest yeah they actually think there's a brand
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:58.400]   called oof that makes a crib that's actually a nest crib but um yeah this would be great until it
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:04.080]   goes down like so many of the nest products do and you're like my baby what happened are you
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:13.120]   anti-nest now i'm not anti-nest i'm just nest has some issues and like just this week they were down
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:20.400]   for remote access do you use a nest i do i use a nest oh is that a nice bag is that your verse yes
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:26.320]   it's a nice bag isn't it i bought a night oh i bought a new bag that should have been my thing

[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:55.680]   started carrying that and this i'll show you the other reason i started carrying a MERS
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:05.840]   not for that my keys have i feel like a jailer it's like you're ridiculous your phone should be

[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:18.800]   it looks like a little mini tesla that's oh you know what i says model x and it's got little window
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:23.920]   you press the window the the door the different you press different parts for different things to
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:29.200]   have happen it's true i bought i bought a little cover that's like a little plastic thing that's
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.800]   shapes over that because they give you this leather one that's just too big oh they give me nothing

[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:43.840]   no but it was a nice it's a nice experience when you buy a new one they have a little
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:48.000]   kind of like a little plaque and stuff i mean they they gave me an umbrella sucker

[01:36:54.160 --> 01:37:01.200]   uh stacey your pick of the week all right this this in keeping with my literary tradition not so much
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:09.280]   i if you aren't watching stranger things oh you should be because it is like x files meets goonies
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:16.160]   and exactly just i'm not even a huge horror fan but mean either it's it's it's only eight
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:22.160]   episodes it's i think they've got renewed for a second season they did and i haven't so i haven't
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:29.600]   gotten all the way i'm i'm where are we tonight is episode seven and i actually have come up with
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.760]   this like stranger things quote unquote hack because i can't handle where the the show cuts off
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:41.440]   yeah this is they do it really well with cliffhanger cutoffs every time so now like at some
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:45.760]   point in time towards the end of the show i'm just like stop it right here oh that's funny so we can
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:51.920]   go to bed oh that's hysterical yeah because other well okay so that's why i've seen all eight in a
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:59.040]   couple of days for that because lee still say let's just watch the next one he's like we could do
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:05.280]   three at a night we're gonna do three in a night easy yeah it doesn't take long it's a good show tv
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.680]   you should watch it this is a Netflix original i just uh review online it says one of the five
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:14.880]   best Netflix originals which isn't oh i mean watch that have you watched brain dead no
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:21.840]   what's that it's an amazon original it's on it's also on cbs it is uh alien ants it's from
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:28.080]   the producers of the good wife oh i love that show exactly and alien ants it explains why washing
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.280]   it is so messed up because the alien ants have gone out of the heads of politicians and their
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.360]   brains departed and that's why they're all being stupid and so it just explains our current
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:40.960]   politics it's it's that's pretty funny it is it's great tony shaloub is in it the
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:46.480]   i love you he looks like there's brain ants in his brain he does it very well it does it very well
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:52.320]   so i love that i love brain dead and then um i'm a huge fan i think we've talked about it unreal
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:57.600]   i haven't seen that oh i want to watch that those oh oh you got you got to go start at the first
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:04.800]   season but it's only you can you can it is it is the unreal is a uh fictional account of behind the
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:13.440]   scenes of a bachelor like show it is magnificent i love the show reality behind reality yes so it's
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:18.240]   there there are moral quandaries in doing horrible evil awful things just for the sake of show business
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:23.920]   it's it's those are my two favorite shows right now lovely lovely stranger things i'll watch
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:28.480]   stranger things thank you sassy yeah it's winona riders return to a television of
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:34.000]   she's you know in uh it's kind of irritating in this one yeah because real well she's kooky
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.440]   yeah she plays a harried mom of a with a missing child so you totally understand why she's a bit
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:47.600]   shrill but you're kind of like well enough for the shrill yeah please winona take it down now i
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:53.520]   know it's interesting there are three different distinct groups that i think you'll be interested
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:57.200]   in the structure of it uh jeff because there's three distinct groups there's
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:01.760]   the kids the goony age kids by the way there's a lot of resemblance to e t as well and this is
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:06.800]   it's a it's the 80s so it's all it's got all the 80s the guys the guys the guys basic and there's
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:11.440]   actually posts that you can see that pull out every reference in the whole thing it's the duffy
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:18.960]   brothers whoever they are duffler duffler duffler brothers and then uh there's a teenage cast
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:24.880]   and and then there's an adult cast and they and they're parallel stories and it's really well
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:31.120]   done it's all one story but it's really well done uh it is yeah i really liked it and as a child who
