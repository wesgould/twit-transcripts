[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   We talk about pretty much anything we want. Stacey Iggabotham is here. She is in charge of Internet of Things devices on this show.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Well, she's in charge of good journalism in general. Always a pleasure to have you, Stacey.

[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Jeff Jarvis is also here from New Jersey.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Joryzy. Home of Governor Christie. Buzzmachined.com.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   It's not, you know, easy to become a punchline. Just you say, Governor Christie says you'll laugh.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I think we could criticize Christie and none of our listeners will come out for us from being political.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Oh, I got it. I'm sure there's got to be some Governor Christie fans out there.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Jeff is a professor of journalism at CUNY. He blogs at Buzzmachined.com.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It's the author of many a fine book.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Hey, look who's here and I'm glad he is because I wanted to find out what's going on with Danny Sullivan.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   He was the creator of, and I had forgotten about this before search engine land, search engine watch.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That's how we first met. You were doing search engine watch.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I forgot you got acquired. It became search engine land founded marketing land.com and search engine land.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And now you've decided to take a step back and become an advisor to the parent company.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yep.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Which means you're basically on the beach.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Tell us about that. You're way too young to retire, Danny Sullivan.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Well, you know, I've been covering the search space, the search marketing, digital marketing space for 21 years.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Wow.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I just kind of ready for a break.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   You're exhausted.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Yeah, I'm exhausted. I've peed to that.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yeah. I mean, there are some things like, you know, there are some stories I felt like I've written the same story seven, eight times.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   You know, the names have changed, but the core principles are the same.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And so, you know, you get to some degree where you feel like it's both not as challenging as you'd like.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And also, does anybody want to hear me whine over the same things over and over again?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Yes.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's why we have you on.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Oh, well, why is the same thing, but new people read it.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   No, and there is that. I mean, I don't mean to take away from that.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And there is a challenge. And I do enjoy a chance when I come in and, you know, explain something and talk about something.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   But, you know, there's lots of great people who do that as well.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And also, I just sort of, it was sort of a daily thing.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I mean, I feel like I've been running on a daily basis in terms of this kind of coverage.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Although I wouldn't write every day still was always every day.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   You know, we're running a business. We're doing this sort of thing.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And so I was just ready for a break.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   So, you know, more power to you. I mean, I, God bless you. I think it's great.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So, you know, we've been building the company up over the past 10 years.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And we've got a great staff of people there. And I feel like, great that everybody said everybody's churning along.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   They're going to do great. I've managed to help help build things up enough.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I could put myself out of a job.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   That's a good job. Good work. Nice work if you can get it.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So, you're going to kind of stay on in the advisory capacity of Third Door Media,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   but you're no longer a chief content officer over there.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Right. So, you know, I'm there.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   If they've got questions, if they need me for anything, you know, I'm around.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I'm still, you know, love the company. I love everybody there.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I want them to be successful.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You know, I still have chairs in the company. So, I really wanted to be successful.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   But, you know, I'm just there.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Just there, if they have questions for me and if they don't, then that's cool.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Do you think you'll take another job? Or what do you think you'll do? You take a pottery? I mean, yeah.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Well, right now I'm busy building an AT-AT.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Oh, God, in the backyard. That's always good.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   For Comic Con, actually, for garage. So, that's occupied a bit of my time.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Are you serious?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I put it up on Twitter. We just did our test walk today.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   We just have to wrap it all up.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   There's a bed in the house that I will not get it done in time for next week.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   How tall is it?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   It's not that bad. It's, you know, it comes up to, "Why can't show you?"
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I can show you.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I have the methodology. So, there are going to be people in it.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Yes. There we go.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And now, watch out for those guys with the lariots who could pull you, take you down just by running around you.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   It's all going to be, "No, well, we have plans for little speeders to run around."
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Oh, that's so awesome.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I have great plans. Many plans.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   So, the headline is, "Danny Sullivan Retires."
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   "Danny, you need to get a job from a search engine to build Star Wars, work Star Wars cosplay."
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   It's going to take the summer to kind of relax.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   My oldest son's going off to college in the fall, so, you know, just spending as much time as I can with them.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I think that's awesome.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   We'll see.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I know.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Actually, as you might gather, love science fiction a lot.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   So, I might become a science fiction TV show recapper.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   If you ever want to do a podcast, you know who to call.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Oh.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Actually, you probably have a lot of people saying that to you.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I have a great podcast I'd love to do. I just want to get people who know everything about comic books to sit down with me
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   every time there's one of those movies and say, "Now, what was the backstory on that?"
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   No.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I think the right title for it, but it's like comic books in films for idiots.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It was what I would probably call it.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   So, we'll do that. I'd like to do some tech writing occasionally for things that I'm interested in.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   If something's not, you know, I like to explore topics.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And so, you know, I expect I'll do some writing.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Who knows? Maybe I'll still write a search thing or whatever if a Twitter rant doesn't do it enough for me.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   But, you know, I'm just kind of enjoying a little time off to kind of relax and recharge and just think about what kind of writing I want to do next.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   So, yeah, we'll see.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Well, that's great. And you're always welcome to stop by because your insights are so valuable and we're kind of missing on the way.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So, please, you know, you, Daddy, honest to God, you are the most astute analyst of the web business.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And I hope we don't lose you with that, really.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Well, thank you very much, Jeff. And back at you for all the great stuff that you do as well.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And I, you know, I definitely it's funny.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   The kids keep going. Stop saying you're retired.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   They want you to at least still be get through college, Dad.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   It's more, you know, it's just it's more a shift towards doing something else.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I definitely don't want to jump in and spend, you know, the grind of, especially on the marketing aspect stuff or whatever.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   But, you know, general stuff, if I think I'm useful, I can say.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And I plan to still be busy certainly out on the Twitter.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Yeah, your Twitter feed is great. People should follow at Daddy Sullivan because you're commenting on a lot of stuff,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   including today's net neutrality rally.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   If you're watching our live stream, we're in black and white today because today is the day we're battling to save the net from the new FCC chairman and his minions.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   If you go to battle, let's see, there's a number of places to go.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   What is the one we're recommending? I can't remember battle for the net.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   If you go to twit.tv is a link to it. In fact, I like our, I think I like what we did on the front page here.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Wow. Yeah. And then trouble for this.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   But I think one of the most effective arguments is on Funny or Die.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Is it is it adults? It's safe. I think it's safe. It's safe. It's far.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Oh, this is the web without net neutrality.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And this is what a lot of people are doing if you go to various sites.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   You guys did it too, right? I saw that pop up.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Maybe.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Or did I just see it somewhere else?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Might have been somewhere else.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   There it is. You're hurt in the middle?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Horn Stars defend net neutrality. Horn Stars. Oh, I was wondering.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I'll just skip that one. So, it's actually it's funny.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Oh, I'm sure it's funny. As Funny or Die almost always.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Almost always is. We could also show the yelling man takes on net neutrality.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Oh, that's a good one. I'll leave that as an exercise to the viewer.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   If you go to Reddit, they have a big Danny's clip to this one.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   It's kind of this is kind of cool because it's slowly at looks like 300
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   bawd. The Internet's less fun when your favorite site's load slowly, isn't it?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Whether you're here for news amaise or some good old fashioned cats in business attire.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   The Internet's at its best when you not Internet service providers decide to
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   decide what you see online.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   We have a big dog in this time because Twit probably would have a hard time
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   if Internet service providers could prioritize other video streams and
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   by reverse discrimination hurt us.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Who wants to pay Comcast or AT&T more money just to get?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   YouTube or Reddit or.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And then really you as a business.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Or Twit. So yeah, and it's not I'm not so much worried about Twit is the next
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   way.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   You too. We find Google will pay the fees anyway.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Yeah. Well, that's the point is the benefits.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   It's got two problems. One is it benefits big companies that are already made.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   They can afford to give past a little back she shot at Internet service providers
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   for access to you. It also the other problem is that the Internet service providers
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   become the arbiters of what succeeds and fails. And that's why we don't like zero
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   rating to when companies like T-Mobile say, well, you can listen to these services
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   and it won't ding you for bandwidth.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   That's another way of picking the incumbents and we don't want the big Internet
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   service providers decide winners and losers on the Internet.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It is too soon to limit the net.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   It will always be too soon. The net needs to be.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Well, I think the competition. You know, so I didn't interview this morning for
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Vellci and rule on MSNBC this Saturday.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And you know, I'll make this.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   We're going to be able to show many times.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   If we had sufficient competition, I think that would take care of her, but we do not.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Right.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So I could imagine a day where you have many, many service providers and that made
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   the best of the best priced win. And we don't need it.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Not neutrality, but we need it now.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I don't think we'll ever get to that point because the people who can build an
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   ISP type network, you have to be so big to do it.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   And you have to behave in kind of a dickish manner in order to make it work
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   because the regulatory and competitive hurdles are so high.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   So I kind of feel like we're never going to get the competition we need.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   And then when we think about like greater verticalization across the board,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I think that also will stand against it.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   That's just me.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   One thing that might make a difference is wireless because, of course,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   the infrastructure required to do wired Internet is pretty prohibitive.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   If we look at 5G wireless, so I'm using 5G not as the, I'm using it as the
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   millimeter wave fixed wireless.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   So that's what Google, Facebook, AT&T, Verizon are all testing this.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   And this is basically using spectrum that currently doesn't travel well through
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   walls. And there's a couple of technical things that have happened to make it
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   more financially viable and faster.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   So if we did something like that and they're testing that now,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   that economically could work.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And that's kind of what Starry is trying to do, although I have no idea how
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   well Starry is doing now.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   The other, the other, the plan that I'm most in favor of, but seems even less
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   likely to succeed, is the notion that municipalities own the infrastructure
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   just as in many places they might own the power grid or the gas lines or the
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   water lines, and then maintain it.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   And then I'll lease it out to any company that wants to use that infrastructure
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   to provide Internet service.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I really like that model, and that's a model in some countries that is the case,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   the government often owns the infrastructure.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   But that gives, to me, the best of both worlds because the municipality then,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   you know, it's like the roads. The municipality creates a network of data
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   and allows others to ride on it, and they can make their money back by
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   charging a toll. But the compet- then you have real competition over those
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   lines.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   I don't think we're going to get that under this FCC, some of the last FCC
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   charges are going to create.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   It could be decades, but no, I know.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I'm like, it's a great idea, sort of.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   It becomes- it's a challenge because of the way we invested in broadband
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   initially. So I think it'd be great if municipalities could do it, but it's
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   going to cost so much in AT&T and Verizon would sue because they would lose their
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   rights to do this.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Well, the advocates for it, which include, by the way, Bob Frankston, one of
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   the creators of VisiCalc, the advocates for this say- the city's
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   municipalities could take over the existing infrastructure using eminent
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   domain. And so you could- yeah, but you're right. I mean, the real problem.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Yeah, the real problem in this country is exactly what we're seeing and why
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   we're fighting today, which is that the telecommunications companies are the
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   single biggest donors to the United States Congress via their political
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   action committees and lobbies. And as a result, they get their way. And they get
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   their way in state legislatures too, which have in many cases, I think 23
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   states banned municipal Wi-Fi. So maybe as Larry Lessick said, the best thing to
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   do is to get the influence of money out of politics first, and then we could talk
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   about a whole lot of other things.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   I'm for it.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Let's make that happen.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Yeah, you're going to run for Senate in Texas, right?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Oh, Ned, I think you've got to start small. Maybe I'll run for the school board.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Okay, that's good.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   That's influential. That's good.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   You guys want to weigh in? Stacy and I are dominating here.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   No, I think we've talked a lot about that neutrality and this is the sad part
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   as we have to talk about it again.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Yeah, and we- you know what? The fight is not over. We'll have to keep fighting.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Of course, you remember that the FCC claimed that they had been hit with the
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   distributed aisle of service attack and so had to close down comments.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   They are, I think they're up. If you go FCC yourself, which is the fabulous
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   domain created by Stephen Colbert, yeah, it'll take you to what they euphemistically
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   call restoring Internet freedom.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   My big concern in all this is, you know, like I was reading through the article
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   and I thought the Verge had a good article and everything everybody's doing,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   it was like, we've got things now where you don't even have to go to the site
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   and you just push a button and I felt like-
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Yes, slack-to-vision. Yeah.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   But yeah, and I'm concerned if- yes, we've done all this, but it gets dismissed as,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   well, it's just, you know, it's basically all robots.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   They're not going to vote anywhere. You know, it's not. Yeah.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   That's another problem. I mean, there's a really big problem in this country,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   which is that the voice of the voter is not necessarily honored because of
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   gerrymandering, because of the very lopsided system we have, which ways,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   rural voters way up ahead of urban voters.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   But I wonder if there's a way to- I wonder if there's a way for the states themselves
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   to impose some rules. Like one of the things about California with, you know,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   our car emissions was that we'd set our emissions to a certain level,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   and then you had manufacturers say, well, we might as well hit the California level
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   because we sell so many cars there, it's just easier to do the whole thing.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   And I wonder if you had states mandate their own state-based net neutrality systems.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   If, first of all, you might get around some of the federal government lobbying.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I'm not going to work everywhere, but at least you have 50 different fronts
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   rather than one that you might lose off of.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And if it might cause some of these people to say, look,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   we can try to do all this, but we're going to not be able to do it in half of these states,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   so let's just say we don't do it.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And to say we don't do it as a benefit, you know, that we won't do this
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   and actually embrace it rather than, you know, that will gain as customers.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   I think that's an interesting idea.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   I would say Texas would never go because we are strictly AT&T company.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I would point you guys too, because we're kind of talking about this
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   and it's worth it to anyone who actually who really cares about this issue.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   The New Yorker did a really excellent article called "America's Future is Texas"
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   by Lawrence Wright, who's here in Austin.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And that was a really nice explainer.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And I've been aware of this because I've lived in Austin my whole life, not my whole life, a long time.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And followed a lot of this, but he explains how Texas serves as a microcosm
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   for the Republican Party's ability to gerry manner and take control over a lot of places.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And it's really scary, especially as someone who lives in Texas
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   and is watching currently our legislature just run roughshod
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   over some of the laws that Austin has tried to pass and other cities in Texas
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   that are a little bluer.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   So it's worth a read if this is something that you're interested in.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I was kind of disheartened because they didn't really talk much about solutions.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I think a lot of states see the...
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Who is the state senator who filibustered about right to life in Texas?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Wendy Davis.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Thank you, Wendy Davis.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I heard Wendy Davis speak at a journalism conference.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   She's amazing.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   She's amazing.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And she said that in the population, Texas is about as purple as California.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   It's just that with the gerrymandering and voter suppression, there's much less voting.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Austin is six.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Here's crazy.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Austin, we have six representatives.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Not one.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   My representative, Roger Williams, apparently, who is also Lauren's rights,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   his district goes all the way up to Waco.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And if you've been to Waco...
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   It's...
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   So my little slice of the Austin pie was divvied up.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   So as a voter, I have very little power in even local representation for Congress.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And I have a...
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Do I have a...
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I think I actually have a Republican local state senator.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   So my congressional representative is taken away from me because of gerrymandering,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   which is a problem.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And then nationally, you know, I've got John Cornyn and Ted Cruz.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   So I never thought I'd get there nationally, but maybe I could one day.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   The good news is District Court has ruled that the Texas gerrymandering is racially motivated and illegal.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   And we've seen the...
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   It's true.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   But whether that anything will happen is another matter.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   They're only redoing a couple of districts.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   I was really excited about that.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And then I spent some time looking into it.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   It's not as great as I thought it would be.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   But hey, every little bit helps.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It bugs me.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   It bugs me.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Yeah, it bugs me because in a populist state like California, our vote counts about a third,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   the vote of somebody in a less populist state like Vermont in the presidential election.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And, you know, and this was...
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   It's an interesting history of this country.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   It was really created by the founding fathers, all men.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   And many slave owners to protect the rights of the rural colonists against the rights of the city colonists.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   But often that meant to protect the rights of slaveholders against the abolitionists.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And it's kind of a grim history that just doesn't seem to quit.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   And the main reason I want...
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   We bring this up is I don't want people to give up.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   And I feel like people have given up.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   In Niele Patel's article on the Verge, he quotes Wired's tech reviewer David Pierce saying,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   "I don't think reviewing internet service providers matters because I don't think anyone has any inkling that an ISP can be good."
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   It's like reading Yelp reviews of Comcast.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   The best case scenario is you don't think about it and it only gets worse.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And even...
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Well, I'll...
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Listen, nobody loves an ISP, but...
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Except ours.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Some fairness.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Some fairness, my Fios is a good side.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   As much as I've screamed about Verizon Mobile, I got to be fair.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   My knock would that it doesn't go out of me right now.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   My Fios service is very good.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   What's...
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   We were time Warner and I guess it's now Spectrum, but to be honest, it's been great because they actually lowered my price and they upped my band with.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And I didn't even do anything.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   So not only did I not think about it, but it all increased.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   So I...
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Maybe I'm a lucky one.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Well, but that's only one metric of a good ISP because Verizon and Spectrum will throw you to the wolves.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   The minute a government subpoena comes in over the transom.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   You know, they're...
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Or let's say a letter from the record industry.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   I don't know about your rates.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Look at your bill.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Has that been ratcheting up regularly?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   The cable rates are rising.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Some five, six, five or six times faster than Internet rates are rising.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   But I don't take my cable.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   I take my satellite and that's actually gotten cheaper too because I'm direct TV and AT&T and they keep throwing discounts because the two are bundled together.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   So...
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Well, there's also issues.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   So there are issues of data caps and then there are issues of...
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   We'll make you unhappy yet, Danny.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Sorry.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   So there's data caps Verizon doesn't...
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   I've not had any of my data caps at the house as far as I can tell it.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Right.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   That was time...
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   So back in 2008, Time Warner was actually the first company to try to implement data caps and they were pushed back pretty vehemently, although Comcast later succeeded.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Wait, I have a terabyte data cap on my Comcast at home and we've exceeded it three months in a row.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Well...
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   So we're gonna get...
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   He's...
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Oh, by the way, Danny, you have AT&T.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   I forgot.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   They love net neutrality.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   In fact, they've signed on to this protest.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Which is fantastic.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   I didn't even read...
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   I didn't even read the story because I'm like, "Are you seriously?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Like, what?"
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   This is the company that blocked customer access to FaceTime unless you bought a more expensive plan.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   The good old guys at AT&T.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Tomorrow, they wrote, "AT&T will join the day of action for preserving, advancing and open internet."
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   This may seem like an anomaly to many people.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   My question why AT&T is joining with those differing viewpoints on how to ensure an open and free internet.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   But that's the point.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   How are they doing this with the straight face?
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   I don't know.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   It's consistent with AT&T's proud history of chapping our company's rights to an open internet.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   As long as we control it and can make more money.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   This is because we have become so successful as a...
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I mean this very facetiously as a country for being able to look at something that says one thing and say, "Oh, AT&T is totally in favor of it."
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   AT&T has always supported Eurasia.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   It was never at war with East Asia.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Exactly.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   What is it, the lies are truth.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   War is peace.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   And we're really entering that time where...
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   I feel bad for people because psychologically it's got to be disturbing to think something is true.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   We're basically all being gas-lighted all the time.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   I mean to step back, we're in the space.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   This gets us upset.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   For a lot of people, it's not going to be upsetting.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   That's why we're trying to arrange them awareness here.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   The G-Mobile wants to give me free data.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Yeah, good.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Nice.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I'm going to get subpoenaed.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   I didn't do anything wrong.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Why was that going to bother me?
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   You can see that it's not a thing that's going to excite a whole lot of people.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I always find the thing that excites the most of the idea.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And this, somebody did this years ago, was like, you know, that you have to pick out what you want to pay for on your cable bill.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   So who did it?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   I can't remember that.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Oh yeah, I remember that.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   But it was like a little graphic and it was like, okay, I want YouTube.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   That'll cost me $10 a month.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   But I would like to have Facebook.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Oh, and I would like to have Facebook, but I will also be required to subscribe to my regional sports service fee.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   You know, that's the stuff I think that really ticks people off.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   If the internet were run the same way the cable companies run to.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   But the cable companies would never do that.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   What happens is, and this is a core problem with innovation, you never know what's not going to happen.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And that's kind of the thread here.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   You never know what's not going to happen.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   You're proving a negative when you're regularly.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Right.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   You're never not going to do it.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Okay.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   I like it.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   I think it's the title of the show.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   More cones that make no sense from Stacy.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Stacy's cones.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   All right.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   I think we've said what we need to say.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Probably anybody who's following this issue knows how they where they stand.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   And I hope they will let the FCC and their member of Congress know.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And we could just leave it at that.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   And I don't know.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Let Ted know how you feel Stacy.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Yep.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   I actually call both Ted and John Cornyn every week and let them know all kinds of things.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And I even call Roger Williams.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   He sent me a letter saying he doesn't care.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   It was a nice letter.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   It was a nice letter that said that many of my constituents are in favor of the following policies that I support.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So he was like, you know what?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   You're not in favor.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Which he's right.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   You should have.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   You should have Roar Bocker here because when I call his office there, like, well, we don't know his position.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   We can't know.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   He doesn't know.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   He told me once he couldn't have a position on anything President Trump would say.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Because he's just a congressman.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Or he can't possibly know everything that's in the bills he's voting on.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Or.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Oh, he's a he's a really wonderful source.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   He's awful.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Great quotes.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Doesn't he the guy who said, well, you could always just get off the Internet if you don't like it.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Or we can have town halls, but we can only have telephonic sound.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   We can only have telephonic town halls that are not announced in advance.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And if you happen to be at home at the time that they didn't tell you in advance and your phone rings and you knew that that was going to be them, then maybe you could participate if you were one of the random people.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   It's just like you're awful.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Just awful.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   So, let's go to the FCC comment.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Let's see if we could bring it down again with another distributed denial of service attack.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Oh, all right.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   That's our communicator.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   That's cool.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   There's no net problems on that.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   I like that.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Is that for your you're confusing your cosplay now?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   I'm happy I am unlike the two roommates that got into a knife fight over whether Star Wars or Star Trek was better last week.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Such a silly thing to do since Star Trek is so obvious and superior.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   You don't know who won because they didn't identify them.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   No, this is nice.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   It's like a Bluetooth speaker and it plays music.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   From my phone.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   You could take phone calls on it.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Anyway, Google Photos and Google Drive is adding its backup and sync tool for the Macintosh.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Why?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   What?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   You know, it's sort of like, you know, a carbonite or one of these other online backup, but it's only for existing folders, desktop documents and pictures.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   And of course you pay for the storage.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   But I should mention that anyway.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Wait, how is this different than what they do already?
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Well, they did it on Windows first and I think they now do it on the Mac.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Is that what's new?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   No, I don't know.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Something was really...
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Something was really...
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   I want to understand more.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Oh, as opposed to what you do right now with the Google Drive syncing.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Yeah, I just put all my photos in Google Drive.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Yeah, so that's a Google Drive folder.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Now you can back up your desktop folder, your documents folder and your pictures folder onto Google Drive automatically.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   It's a sync...
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   A sync...
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   A sync...
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Oh...
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   I wish what's knowing me about them.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I'm just...
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Oh, I want to lose my mind.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Is that we don't have...
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Like, you can't use Google Drive with multiple accounts, right?
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Like, you can...
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Yes.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   That's it.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Yes.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   That's why you're on this side of the stage.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   You too have this...
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Niagara Falls.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   You think it's a wonderful solution.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Okay, so get in sync because that allows you to have multiple Google Drive.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   The other thing is like...
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   As our laptop storage space continues to condense down to like 128 gigabytes to 60 gigabytes.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   You want to support for external drives.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Just make it happen.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Why can't I...
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   How much do you pay for in sync?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   This is cool.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   It's like 30 years.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   I think it's wonderful.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   It really is because I have three different Google accounts that I deal with.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   So you kind of a unified inbox for your Google Drive.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   But it's only for...
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Sorry, I have a specific need.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   So I'm like, "Oh, would it work for...
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Okay, maybe.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   I'll try."
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   It'll work with any of your Google Drive accounts.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And it'll also support an external drive, which is wonderful.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   So I would really like Google just to buy them.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.400]   But of course I would like Google to just give me the same features, although it makes
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.000]   me sad for the people over at in sync.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Which is nice.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   I'm going to get this.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   This works for Linux too.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And they're really good.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   They've been very dependent on it.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Really, it's saved me.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   But it is those things where you're like, "Why don't you have this stuff, Google?
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Why?"
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   If you just had Chromebooks people, well, that's not a issue.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Well, that's not a issue.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   But the reason why this isn't Google been saying, "Oh, it's too hard.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   We can't figure it out.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   We don't know how to do it."
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And these guys just come along and do it.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Just because they don't care.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   They don't care.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   I want my calendars.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   I want both of my calendars.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   This doesn't seem to offer what I want.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Dang it.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Visitors.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Okay, this is the stupidest thing, but it's actually...
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   This is my first world problem.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   I want my main calendar is on my business Google account.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   So my paid G Suite's account.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   And I can sync that over to my personal stuff.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.960]   But what happens is when I go into my Google Home and I want to share data, it will only
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.000]   share from my personal account.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   It won't share from my business account.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   And so my calendar is horribly inaccurate.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.240]   And I would love to actually be able to ask, "Hey, Echo or hey Google Home, what's on my
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.240]   calendar today?"
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.000]   And get the right stuff.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   You can't have your Google...
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   So one of the Google calendars can subscribe to the other.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Can't you subscribe to your business calendar in your home calendar?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   So I did.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I subscribed to my personal calendar to my business calendar.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   But because it won't let me link my business calendar to the Echo, I think that's the issue.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Right.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   So go the other way.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Make your home calendar be the master calendar.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Subscribe to your business calendar in the home calendar.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   But then I have to...
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Okay.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Yes.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Okay.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Maybe that would work.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   But then do I...
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.840]   I did this before because I'm in the same situation I've had at work where my business
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   and my...
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   Okay.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.840]   I just need to swap my subscriptions then.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:42.560]   Or hey, you know what Google could do would be like, I don't know, support people with G-Sync,
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.000]   Drive, whatever the heck they call it now, to pay money.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   It's funny.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Yes, as soon as you get a chance everybody else gets.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   As soon as you get a G-suite cat, you're suddenly disadvantaged.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   You want to pay the money they screwed me over.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Well, you know, you want to pay us money?
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Oh, no, you can't use Google.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Bye.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Sorry.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Sorry.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   You can't now, by the way.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   You can't use Google.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   You can't use Google.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   They just all put it up so you can't use Google.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Fine now.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   I'm G-suite.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   I'm G-suite.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Every time I go to it, it's like Google.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   I'm going there right now.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I've done it.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   I've done it.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   I'm going to kill my old fire count and I've now got my G-spot fire count.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   G-suite.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   See, I still don't trust it though because I'm still waiting for them to then go, "Oh no,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   no no, we changed."
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   "Oh, oh, but this other thing won't work."
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I never get it.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   I never get it.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Actually, I'm glad I have a fire count now because Hangout still works for text messaging,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   but only if you have a file.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Yeah, isn't that great?
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   I feel bad for everybody else.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   I was tempted to dump it, but I'm going off to Italy.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   I thought that would be handy.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Switch it on right to the plane.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   It's all ready to go.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Now they had this group deal that's still good for a few days where you can add somebody
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   else.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   And, oh, an administrator has turned off Google 5, Project 5 Access.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   I am the administrator.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Turn it on, baby.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Turn it back on.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I'm like G-suite of one.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   That's the other thing.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   It's like, can I have a G-suite that's designed for a single person who just does it.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Who just doesn't want to have a Gmail account.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Make it exactly like G-suite.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Why would you, if it's just you, what do you need a G-suite for?
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   I don't know, maybe because it's my own go domain name.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Right.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   For your own.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   That's my issue.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   I have this.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Somebody email me saying they heard rumors that Google might just basically do that.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   It's making, you know, allow you to keep your domain.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   And that's exactly why I'm doing it.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   I don't care about all the G-suite stuff.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Yeah, because if, because on my G-suite, I'm calendar.twit.tv, mail.twit.tv.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   But, yeah, I'm going to make sense.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   I've added extra emails, but essentially that's, yeah, you want your customer.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   But you only pay what five bucks a month because it's one person, right?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   I think it's nine dollars a month.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Oh, that's a little much.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   I think I did the, I think it's like 68 years something.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   That's not bad.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   That's five dollars.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   I probably have some old grand.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Well, this is a great show to listen to if you want to understand how Google really works, kids.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Well, we're covering Google.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Hey, we don't even know.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Oh, no.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   It's five dollars a month.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And Google, Google gripes.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   So are you going to get the new Google Pixel?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   We're learning more and more.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Lots of rumors.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   I just had to buy a new one only a month ago because I dropped the last one in the toilet.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Now I got a buy another one.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   I just need to be a water.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Yeah, let's not talk about that.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Oh, she's dropping in the toilet.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   These are renders from the Android police or the Popo, the Android Popo, as I call them,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   that are based on descriptions of this edge to edge OLED.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   It's a Galaxy 8 that you can squeeze.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   It'll be squeezable.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   It's made by LG.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   So the HTC, what is it?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   The 11 has squeezable sides.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Yeah, Jeff, and you've seen how popular that's been.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   I mean, everywhere you go, you see people using their HTCs going, "Thank goodness, I can squeeze this thing."
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   It seems to me not such a good feature, but maybe Google.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   We used to do what?
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Well, to interact with Google Assistant is the thought.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Okay, so I squeeze my phone all the time accidentally.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   And I can't tell you how many times my camera is like, I'm like picking up the phone and the camera's on
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   because I grabbed the button too hard.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   And I feel that a squeezable phone, sometimes I just get tense.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   You still squeeze the pixel.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Like when you guys are talking over me or something, and I'm like, "What's going to happen then?"
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Google Assistant will be like, "Let's take a few deep breaths."
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Actually, that would be really handy.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Well, you know, if you shake the phone, it launches the debugger to say, "Hey, are you having problems?"
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Because they figure it out.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Really?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   My own logo.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   I had a Motorola and whenever I shook the phone, the flashlight went on, and that was super handy.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   And then we just saw a story that said that Google's watching for people who press the back button
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   really rapidly a lot because they're stuck.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   And then, "Meaudia, yeah."
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   It's called Panic Detection Mode.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   This is in 7-1.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   And when it sees the Frantic Pack button presses it, it realizes it knows the program's crashed and bales.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   That tells you something.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   That tells you something.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   I always think of that for websites, if they could do that on websites for ads, because that always happens to me.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   If I'm not going through an adblock browser and I'm going through something else, I'm like, "Wait!
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Oh, crap!"
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   And then I'm like, "Screw it."
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   So if they could actually just take me back to my story, that would be nice.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   And ding that bad website.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   To me, the best news about the new Pixel is that it's going to be LG because there was a rumor that HTC might be making it,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   which would have been very sad.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Now, we think there'll be two.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   There's two code names.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   This is, we're talking about "Time In," which is the biggest one.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   So, according to the Android Popo, it will be edge-to-edge bezel-less design.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   The fingerprint reader will no longer be on the glass part, which is shrunk.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   It'll be in the same spot, but the top glass part is a little bit smaller.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   I don't know what else to say about it.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Google's faced with the curved, yeah.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Squeezable frame is weird.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Oh, no, not the curved thing.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   You mean the Samsung kind of curved thing?
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   No.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   I think we're talking edges being curved now.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Yeah, it's not like it goes all the way.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   It's just soft.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   The iPhone 7 has it.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Curve phone.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   That's so 19.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   2014.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Google's got a problem because both Google and Samsung are going to do the Note 8.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Google, the Pixel, they, last year they came out right before the Apple announcement.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   They'll probably do the same, which means early September, late August.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   And then everybody's got all attention.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   All eyes are going to be on this new iPhone.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Because it's the 10th anniversary and it looks like Apple's going to do some interesting things with it.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   It's going to, you know, meets the iPhone.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   So, it's going to set the stage for what phones need to look like going forward.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Well, to step back, I mean, aside from them having issues because, you know, people will be interested.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   What?
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Do we even know how well the Pixel has done?
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   No.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Because this is the biggest launch they have ever done for a phone.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   This was like, we are in a whole new territory.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   And I didn't get the impression that many people have pixels.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   I judge that solely by the amount of cases I can purchase.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   Right.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   But I actually feel like your case variety, there are cases out there.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   But if I can get a wallet case for a phone, I know that it has a very, very popular audience.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   And it was hard to get one of the cases for my Pixel.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   So, focus group of one.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Well, we all have pixels.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   I don't have a picture.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Remember, I still have a next, I don't, I try to make my phone last for two years because I'm not a phone person.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   I got to spend money on, you know, connected ovens.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   You're crazy.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   You're crazy.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   You're not missing.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   You're not missing anything on them.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   It's, it's, I am excited about this.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   Pictures.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   So you think you'll get a pixel?
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   Well, you're, you're due, right?
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Because it's time to go.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   I do.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   So we're going to have some serious phone discussions going into the September, October time for any of you guys.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   I do need it to be waterproof though.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   I'm at that point now where I do not want to phone.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   It's not waterproof.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Same here, man.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   I've done it now.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   What happens?
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   You guys dropping the urinals?
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Or look.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Why?
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   I go out of the corner.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Luckily, luckily, luckily before any activity.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   I don't, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, people say that a lot.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Why isn't it waterproof?
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   But I don't.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   So there must be a demand, I guess.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   First of all, I did, I fell in the water the other day and, and tried to get in our boat.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   It was, it's a very amusing gift, but I fell in with my iPhone and I was glad that I survived because it was just my pocket and I hadn't anticipated it.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Well, that's why.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   But then I go out paddle boarding and it's nice.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   You want to take pictures to step out there and you, you know, you don't want your phone to die.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Of course, you want to make sure you have something that lets it float too, but still.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   I just want waterproofing in the same way that I will automatically break.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   How about wireless charging?
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Is that a, uh, yeah.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   See, I like that.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   I think that's part of the problem with making a modern smartphone is there's a large.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   A large, I needed the wireless charging because after my Samsung seven that's supposed to be waterproof was waterproof.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   It refused for many days to let me charge it because it just kept saying, well, I think there's water in the USB.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   It's been like four days now.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   I think the water's cleared up.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Right?
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Come on.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   So the wireless charging got it back.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   You know what happened to what I'm buying to go with is that the USB C only works one way.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   It's like the reverse to us earlier land.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Yes.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Oh, so your phone charging takes forever.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Does?
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   No, no, it doesn't.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   No, it only goes in halfway.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   I also need, I also need the phone to do the two lens thing like the iPhone seven does that that portrait mode.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   That's a nice feature.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   That's been.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Well, LG has that on their G six.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   So maybe they will build it onto the pixel X.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   So here's the question.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   If you take it.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Sorry, Danny.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   No, go ahead.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   No, no, I'm empty of response.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I was just going to say if you have two lenses, isn't that the VR 180 format?
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   That's possible.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Yes.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   The YouTube announced.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   So if they're far enough away, you get you get 3d photos.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Yes.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Bad news.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   The renders only have one visible camera lens.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Could be one hidden behind the black plastic at the top.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   I feel they're early on that though.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   They have time.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   I think it's going to be hard though.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   If you're trying to sell the pixel up against the iPhone and the iPhone will be in its second generation of dual lenses.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   I think the iPhone is going to be a big AR play.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   They put out this AR kit a lot of people seem to be doing AR kit based little widgets, little trial.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   But that's a good sign.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   You've got a lot of developers playing with it.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Of course, that's a key to the AR is this depth sensing.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Yes, I was going to say if they have depth sensing on there and then they're also talking about 3d sensing, which is depth sensing, for unlock features on the new iPhone.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Then we probably could see a lot of really cool functionality using computer vision on that thing.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Yes.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   I expect that.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   This is what drives me nuts.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   I'm still waiting for the user interface that isn't like, "Oh, where you wave your phone around."
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   That's what this is like.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   You could argue, that's what Pokemon Go is.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   There's no reason you couldn't put that on any phone really.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   The secret sauce for Apple is besides some fast hardware, better cameras, depth sensing cameras, is this library AR kit,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   which the developers seem to like?
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Yes.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   Well, they won with the App Store.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Why not win with lots of AR/VR content?
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Yes, exactly.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Let the other guys do it.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   We're getting really fragmented.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   One of the things is like, so...
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   I love it.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Danny talks, but his mouth doesn't move.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   I'm like, "Hi!"
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   I've got...
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   I have an Oculus.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   I have a Vive.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   I've got Galaxy Gear as well.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   That's three different VR platforms.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   I can buy a game that's very similar on the Gear to a game that I can buy for an Oculus.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   You have to buy them separately.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   No, okay.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   I know that multiple people aren't going to be buying all these things, but the VR...
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   The VR case is very expensive.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   If you started on a Gear, do you want to abandon that when you go off to this other thing?
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Then if Apple comes out with their own things, I got to buy it for that platform.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   It's one of the nice things.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   This is just the early days argument.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   Well, yeah, maybe.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   What is it about humans that we just have to have as many standards as possible?
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Oh, I just think that X...
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   I can't think of all the letters, X-E, whatever, D.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   X-C-D, X-C-D.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   The study was doing something else standard yesterday.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Oh, the standards thing.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Yes, it's a standard one.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   That's the beauty part of standards.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   There's always another.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   But that's...
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   I'll be very upset, and I know they won't do it, but I'm still going to get upset anyway
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   with Apple, because I know that they will not put USB-C in the iPhone next time.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   And they should.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   They should just bite the bullet and do it.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   They could just be seeing everything else.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   They should say, "I know we're going to upset you, that everybody bought all your lightning stuff.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   Let's make that...
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   We need to change the thing."
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   They'll make people nuts.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   For a year.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   And then people will be like, "Wow, this is amazing."
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   No, I'm so happy.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   I've got one charger that charges everything.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Me, I am.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   And I don't know why Microsoft's another laggard here.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   Their devices still have a proprietary charging connector.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   And their new Surface laptop doesn't even have the type C port.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   I'll see.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   It's great.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   I mean, I can go from a Chromebook to my MacBook, and it's the same charger.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   And then I can use the same charger to charge my Pixel up.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   I had to go out and buy three USB-C to lightning cables, because there's no other way to connect
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   to my MacBook.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   And I needed them for other reasons.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Danny, there's also Google sells a USB-C wall charger that has two USB-C's in it, which is rare to fuck.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   That's a Google thing?
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   That's a Google thing.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   Yeah, Google.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   I bought Google.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   I'm shopping live on the air.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.600]   While you're doing that, let me tell people about Rocket Mortgage.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.600]   How about that?
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:09.800]   Our sponsor today comes to us from Quick and Loans, the best loan company in the country.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.880]   And they get better and better, because they're reaching out to us, the geeks, with their new
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:19.880]   Rocket Mortgage is designed to be completely online.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:24.240]   With the entire mortgage approval process online, no more paperwork.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.600]   You do it all on a phone or a tablet or a computer with a touch of a finger.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.240]   You can apply simply.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:33.240]   You can understand the process fully.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.840]   It's completely transparent.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.720]   That means you'll be confident you're getting the right mortgage for you.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.840]   Based on your income, your assets, and your credit, they analyze all the home loan options
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.040]   and find the one that meets your needs exactly.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.600]   Whether you're looking to buy your first home or 10th, actually, for those of us who bought
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:53.240]   more than one home, Rocket Mortgage is a revelation.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.920]   This home we bought three years ago, Lisa and I bought our house.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.960]   It took us months to get the mortgage.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:01.200]   We almost lost the house because the seller was saying, "What's going on?
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   You don't have the loan?
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.640]   It's been two months."
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.880]   And we're faxing stuff from our crews.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.760]   It was crazy.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.000]   Rocket Mortgage doesn't take months, doesn't take weeks, doesn't it?
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.120]   Days, it takes minutes because, "Oh, computers."
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.800]   You submit everything you need with a touch of a finger because they've got trusted partners
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.480]   with all the financial institutions.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.760]   So bank statements, pay stubs, zigapoom.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.020]   You get to pick the term, you get to pick the rate, and then it will crunch it all and get
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.040]   you the loan that's just right for you.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.520]   And you will have the confidence because you'll see exactly how it works.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.680]   You'll understand all the details.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.680]   You'll know you're getting the right mortgage.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.520]   To get started, it's easy.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:40.240]   Just go to rocketmortgage.com/twig and do that please because then they'll know you heard
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.400]   it here.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.400]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig=housing.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:52.600]   Lend your license in all 50 states at nlsconsumeraxis.org/30-30-rocket-mortgage from quick and loans.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.080]   Go to rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.320]   Danny Sullivan is here.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:01.160]   Formerly of search engine land, he's still a three-door media, but he is looking for work
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.600]   as a cosplay costume designer.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.000]   Anybody have any suggestions?
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   I can't.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.600]   I can't sew and can't really build.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:18.160]   But I don't want to let, I still have a dream and I don't want to feel that my lack of any
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.960]   applicable skill should hold me back.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:25.480]   You know, if I were in your shoes, lots of time on your hand.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:26.480]   I'm literally barefoot.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.440]   A packet of money and no shoes to wear.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:34.480]   I would go out and get a trawler and I'd sail the world.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.880]   Oh well.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:36.880]   That's my dream, you know.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.800]   Well, I've still got another kid at home.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.800]   So take the kid with you.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.760]   Take the kid with you.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   This is your going to learn.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.760]   You know, learn.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.760]   It's going to be a high school.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.640]   This is, you could do high school at sea.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.160]   You're going to get in this thing.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.160]   You're going to.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.560]   No, I was just looking at that.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.560]   No, that was a different thing.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.560]   I was looking at the solar one.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.520]   So you got me very excited.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.760]   There's like a solar catamaran.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.160]   Well, I would like a solar boat.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.160]   That's what I would like.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.160]   So you know what?
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.160]   Actually, I have thought about.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.560]   It's called the sailboat, by the way.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:09.760]   I thought about that kind of thing many times because, you know, I remember reading
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:14.040]   what was that book the kids hailed around the world?
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.040]   Robin.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.520]   I can't think of the name of his.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.480]   The whole family did it or just one guy.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.400]   He just went on his own and he sailed on his own.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.400]   Robin, what's his name?
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.400]   Sloakum, I want to say.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.400]   Yes.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.400]   Wind.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.400]   Wind.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.400]   It'll come back to me.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.400]   Great book.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.400]   Great book.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.880]   And so I've always, you know, and I sail like a tiny bit in the harbor.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.880]   And so I've thought about it.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.800]   My wife's just like, you know, we'll die.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   You know, it's just kill.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.880]   Well, that's a risk.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:44.320]   And that's why you do it.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:48.000]   I'm going to be, you know, I would like, you're going to go.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.640]   There's a hurricane, but I think I can just skirt around it.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.640]   Yep.
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   It's no fun if there's not a chance of death.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.600]   And I'm like, well, maybe I can get one of those things, you know, just get into the
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:01.320]   cubicle, you jump into the capsule and then we're all fine.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   Kill us.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.200]   And then you just bob there for four days and die of thirst.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   That'd be great.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.200]   It's going to be fun.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   Watermaker.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   We'll have one if I.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.200]   It's going to be so much fun.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.600]   That's actually what I'm waiting for, believe it or not.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.160]   Actually it would be nice to have solar so I don't have to buy gas.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.960]   And I'm really waiting for internet everywhere.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:25.720]   When are we going to get Stacey high speed internet every square inch of this planet?
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.720]   It's not long, right?
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.720]   A decade?
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:31.320]   Maybe if, I mean, you know, I want us to do it, right?
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.920]   He has a lot of fish to fry right now.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:40.880]   Yes, with the smaller satellites, possibly you've got to have the spectrum and then you've
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:46.880]   got to have a cheap module that goes into phones to read the satellite transmissions.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:52.760]   That's a big part of building a, it's not just the internet and the sky.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:56.600]   You've got to have the internet receivers on the ground or in your device.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.600]   And that's tough.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.760]   In the middle of the ocean.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   In the middle of the ocean.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.720]   I mean, this is the boat I think you were talking about.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.400]   This is your new boat.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:08.760]   It makes its own fuel as it's as it circumnavigates the world.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.800]   Oh no, but I could do that too.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.680]   It looks pretty nice.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:18.720]   It makes it makes hydrogen power with the C.E.L.A. solar panels.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.320]   We need that sort of thing.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.320]   The shipping industry.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.480]   Oh no, the shipping industry is working on, I actually put it in my newsletter because
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.480]   I thought it was fascinating.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:34.000]   It's that our electric, electric shipping boats and they're also going to drive themselves.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.520]   The world economic farm had a really, yeah.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.520]   Artifla.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.680]   I feel like Elon after he does trucks and buses, he's going to have to look to boats.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:45.000]   Although somebody told me maybe, oh, it was, I think Jason Calicanis who kind of has some
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.520]   insight and knowledge about Elon said that the real purpose of the hyperloop was not,
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:58.920]   as some think, a super fast, pneumatic tube between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:05.520]   But in fact, a trans-oceanic tube that would eliminate the need for all these, you know,
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:10.840]   container ships going back and forth, you just put a 10,000 iPhones in a container and
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:18.480]   went in and go, boom, boom, boom, boom, all the way across the Pacific and end up in Oakland.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:22.600]   But the problem with that is you'd have to have, you can't have the tube in the water
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.440]   because it's underwater.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.440]   It's under water.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.960]   It's like, it's on the ocean's floor.
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:31.320]   And the thing is because there's no humans on it, there's no humans on it, you can have
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:33.120]   more acceleration.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:40.640]   You don't have to worry, you know, I mean, so basically we're building the postal system
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.720]   in large Manhattan buildings from like the night.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:47.840]   Yeah, you'd go in amazing and you'd order to buy some things.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.680]   Newsrooms had them.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:58.680]   It was my dream really to have an ematic tube system in the old studio.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.920]   It would be great.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:03.320]   There was an Austin company who built a new paddock tube system because they were an
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.840]   extra order at Chipotle.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.000]   So they did a burrito delivery tube.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   Yes.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   You could do that.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.640]   The whole hard, won't our drone thing just do that for us?
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:17.560]   Can't you just put the 10,000 things on a drone delivery thing and just let it fly and
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:18.560]   bring it?
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.520]   Because there's no congestion, it's just a tube.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.880]   But also there's no congestion in the air.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.960]   Oh, there will be congestion in the air.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.960]   Send a thousand drones up, a million drones.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:34.840]   Well, now that we've got one photon to space or whatever was we sent to space.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.080]   It's watch.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.720]   See what she puts it in there.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:44.320]   She's going to send and then the tube goes in the ematic.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:48.840]   I think I was flying through the air in this.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.840]   Don't drive through.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.600]   Drive through still use this today.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:55.240]   I feel like I drive through banks in Texas.
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:02.720]   Well, I was thinking we have drive through pharmacies where the gear barns.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:08.440]   By the time he builds the pneumatic system to send the iPhones and gets it all up and
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:13.440]   working and running under the water at the billions and billions of dollars, then it's
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.760]   like suddenly going to be like, oh, our 3D printers can just print your iPhone at home.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.760]   Well, you will be right back.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.280]   It will be right back to what we're watching now.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.320]   You'll be going, but I could send the iPhone under the water.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.320]   It's awesome.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.520]   We'll send it under the water and they'll be people like, there's still great uses for
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:31.520]   facets.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:38.240]   So you're going to have one bank out there that will still demand that you send them
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.600]   your signature through pneumatic under C2.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.960]   That's what he's going to cause us to have.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.960]   We'll have Alats.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:44.960]   No, okay.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:50.000]   So, pneumatic tubes are a mass distribution.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.280]   So they're port to port and then drones are probably a last mile thing.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.120]   So that makes more sense.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.800]   So we'll have all of the above.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.040]   I just hope we have garage size replicators.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.840]   So we just make everything in our garage.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:05.240]   Well, did you see the teleporium story?
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.240]   Yes.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.240]   But that was one folk point.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.560]   There's a long way to go from there.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.560]   I know.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:11.560]   Explain that to me.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.560]   Was it the actual folk?
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:13.560]   What about happened?
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.600]   When two photons love each other very much, they become tangled.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:23.480]   And then no matter how far away one of the photons is from the other, they think and
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:28.040]   act as if they are one unit.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:32.000]   And the government is trying to ban the ability for those photons to marry.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   And it's not right.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.920]   I believe in my heart of hearts that we are going to find out that this whole thing is
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:39.920]   bogus.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.920]   Daddy, Daddy, get a job.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:42.920]   Get a job.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.920]   I just say it's hard to put your father in.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.000]   I'm just saying Gene Bodden very clearly came from the future.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.720]   Somehow was stranded in the past and just.
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:59:01.560]   I think, you know, you can say quantum entanglement and, you know, teleportation.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:02.360]   And but I don't know.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.720]   How do they know it was the same photon?
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.240]   That's what I'm asking.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.280]   It's all in the article.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.760]   They all know.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.760]   I don't know.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.760]   It's science stuff.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.760]   Like I'm going to understand it.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.920]   Actually, that was one of the things I'm like, I've read that article.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.720]   I thought, see, if only I had some time to write an article explaining what this article
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.600]   is trying to say, right?
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.600]   Those are my two big goals in my life.
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.600]   My future.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.600]   You want to know my plans?
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:29.640]   My plans are to explain how artificial intelligence actually understands things and to explain
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.720]   how quantum entanglement works.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:36.380]   That well, if all you have to do is ask Jigang Renping, Xu, Hae Lin-Yong, Liang Shang,
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:45.700]   Zhang Shaikuo, Lao Juan Wen, Wei Yue Liu, Wen Chi Kai, Meng Yang, Li Li Li Li, Quai
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.500]   Xing Yang, I could go on and on.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:53.300]   These are all the Chinese scientists who were involved in this.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:58.420]   But we demonstrate successful quantum teleportation for six input states and mutually unbiased
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:06.480]   bases with an average fidelity of plus or minus 0.8, well above the classical limit.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.200]   I think this is made up.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.400]   I don't buy it for a minute.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:15.520]   Oh, I did read this, but this was published earlier than July 4th.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.520]   This was a big one.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.520]   This is a new one.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.520]   It's a big one.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.520]   What makes it?
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.520]   No, I satellite quantum.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.920]   I swear to God, I read this because I am like Danny fascinated by this.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.500]   Yeah, I wish I knew enough to understand it.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.260]   This work establishes the first.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:36.600]   June 15th in Science Magazine, China's quantum satellite achieves spooky action at a record
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600]   distance.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.900]   Oh, that's the spooky action.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.900]   That's different.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.820]   No, it's the same study.
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.580]   It's spooky action is not teleportation.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.580]   Okay.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.580]   It is.
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.020]   Tailoportation isn't teleportation.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:54.620]   Yes, this is quantum entanglement among the two photons one from the satellite.
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.620]   Oh, see this is.
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.620]   They didn't mention two photons.
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.720]   This is a total of some issues.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.160]   I said that in the very beginning.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.320]   I said, when two photons love each other.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:09.240]   So if it was right there, when you say teleportation, my impression is that one photon is taken
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.360]   and put in a spooky.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.360]   That's different.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:16.920]   That's a photon interacting with a photon at distance, right?
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.920]   Right.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   So, okay.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.180]   So the issue that what they did here was send it further because we have done the entanglement
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.780]   experiment before.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.100]   So we've done it in the same room.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.800]   We've done it for room to room.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.800]   What they've done is much like, much like light and fiber optics.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.800]   Yes.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.980]   You used to have a different, you had to have repeaters to say to re up your signal.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:43.940]   What they did is they sent this photo, these entangled photons or they sent it further
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:44.940]   without a repeater.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:48.440]   It would be better to say this is communication than teleportation.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.440]   Yes.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.440]   Because that's really what it is.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.860]   We're sending data from point A to point B without being anywhere in between, which is
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:55.860]   a little bit.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:56.860]   Yes.
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:01.960]   This is journalism trying to make something really esoteric, interesting to more people.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.780]   This is like when we say we've invented an invisible cloak.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:09.020]   When we say we figured out how to refract light beams, which is pretty cool.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.020]   Yeah.
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.780]   Wait, we have an invisible cloak?
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.780]   Yes.
[01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:13.780]   Google invisible cloak.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.780]   You'll find it.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.780]   You should wear it to Comic-Con.
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:21.960]   I've done too much.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.640]   I am wearing a cloak to Comic-Con and it's pretty awesome.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.640]   Good news.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:32.720]   I don't believe them, but Google says the Aloe desktop client is coming.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.720]   It's about as likely to be invisible.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   Who cares?
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.920]   Just what we've been waiting for.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.920]   I'm going to tell all my friends on Google+, about this.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.740]   If they just would turn on SMS integration, then they'd be done.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:48.740]   Right?
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:54.900]   I just said, and go back and fix Google Voice, which was wonderful, or make Gmail your universal
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.900]   thing or just pick one.
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:57.900]   It was pick one.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:03.720]   It just launched an app called Google Messenger because everybody else can have generic names
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.340]   and combine all this stuff into one thing.
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:07.340]   Yes, thank you.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.340]   Gosh.
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:11.500]   Now, this one's a little upsetting, but it is from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.840]   I'll let Jeff explain it.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:18.400]   According to the Wall Street Journal, Google has been paying professors.
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.320]   Did you get any of this money, Google?
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:25.720]   I mean, Jeff, $500 to $400,000 for research supporting their business practices.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.160]   Let me log in to get us.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.160]   I pass the paywall here.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.160]   I think it's media media.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.200]   Are they closed that one?
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.600]   Really, there's a backdoor?
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.000]   There was, and they just shut it down, and then everybody got upset.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.400]   It used to be called media media.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.140]   If you just enter media as the login and media as a password.
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:45.140]   I didn't know that.
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:47.140]   So then all these people have gotten upset with the phone.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.300]   I've been paying $149 a year.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.300]   I know.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.300]   Is that all?
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.300]   Yeah, it's not expensive.
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.300]   As long as you get the paper paper.
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.300]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:57.500]   Or you pay total of what?
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.780]   You just say, "Okay, I don't need it."
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.380]   And they go, "Oh, no, no.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.380]   No, no.
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.380]   We still want to continue to send you."
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.380]   We want you to continue to send you to the computer.
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.820]   You charge you more if you don't get the paper paper.
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:08.820]   Because they're ripping off the advertisers.
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:09.820]   Right.
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:10.820]   See, we have circulation.
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:14.840]   No, they're telling the advertisers that they still have people reading every single
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.560]   one of those ads in a print paper.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.000]   And so it's therefore worth the money.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.880]   The myth of mass media as I was to my students is that all readers see all ads.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.680]   So we charge all advertisers for all readers.
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.560]   They put a pin in that because I do want to talk about that because there is a move
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:32.200]   of foot in the podcast industry to do exactly that.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.920]   And it scares the crap out of me.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.080]   But I want to get back to this paying professors.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.560]   So one example I read was that the guy didn't disclose.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.560]   That's bad.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.660]   That's wrong.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:48.040]   But Google is like Bell Labs of the age.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.500]   They're paying lots of people to do lots of kinds of research.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:54.940]   Now how much of it is aimed at their lobbying and how much of it is scientific research
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:57.240]   and how much has benefit in other ways?
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.240]   I don't know.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.720]   The fact that a big company is doing this isn't surprising.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:07.220]   We've, I mean, Coca-Cola sponsors studies to show that, you know, drinking, I fucked
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.220]   up.
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:09.780]   The consumer's syrup is fine.
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.780]   It's good for your health.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:15.860]   I mean, we've seen this for years, but you, we thought a little better of Google that
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.860]   they wouldn't.
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:21.260]   Well, but again, not only, I'm not sure that I don't forget Google does support academic
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.780]   research and scientific research.
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:27.580]   So there may be a few examples in here, but what's the, what's the, and I couldn't see
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:28.580]   the list.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:31.500]   I don't know what the list is because I don't subscribe to the journal.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:34.940]   Google, here I'll read the quote, Google has paper professors whose papers, for instance,
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:39.260]   declared that the collection of consumer data was a fair exchange for its free services,
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:44.020]   that the company didn't use its work and talents to improperly steer users to Google's commercial
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.740]   sites or advertisers.
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.860]   This is for the EU decision, obviously.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.620]   And then it hasn't unfairly quashed competitors.
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:55.180]   Several papers argued that Google's search engine should be allowed to link to books and
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:59.380]   other intellectual property that authors and publishers said should be paid for a group
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:03.940]   that includes news, corporate Jones, the journal is court formally complained to European
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.940]   regulators about Google's handling of news.
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:13.260]   And there's the, so, so we know Rupert hates Google.
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.740]   Yep.
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.460]   So there you go.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.460]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.380]   So I consider the source piece.
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:20.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.140]   I'm not saying that there aren't some papers that are the illogit.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:28.780]   I, I'm not saying that professors who don't reveal the funding are wrong, but I come at
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:34.420]   anything from Berdok land about technology with a great assault the size of Utah.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:35.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:40.300]   And the only professors, I'm looking for names, they got one guy who said, no, I wouldn't
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.780]   take that money.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:46.300]   I'm trying to find these here.
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:52.780]   And they also, to be fair, point out the Qualcomm Verizon and AT&T do the same thing.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:56.060]   And I thought Google's response on their blog was actually very good.
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:57.060]   It was.
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:00.100]   They're like, yeah, we, we spend money.
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.100]   And guess what?
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.780]   We list all the people that we do.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:09.340]   You can find it here unlike, you know, our competitors and, and, and like the, I guess
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:15.340]   the research firm that did all this research, but nobody knows who funds them.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.860]   So they, they had a good pushback on it.
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.860]   That's done.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:22.460]   But you know, the, the end, the end narrative will still be that Google gets paid money
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:23.460]   to.
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:24.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.460]   Cause nobody can read the article.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.460]   They can only read the headline.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:31.500]   Speaking, speaking of attacks on tech companies, a couple of weeks ago, Danny, you did the
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:37.460]   best response to what I thought was a very irresponsible and sensationalistic, oddly enough,
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:43.980]   pro public, a Facebook attack on their training for site monitors.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.980]   Remember that?
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:45.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.620]   That was the, that, that Google has a protect.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.780]   Was it young black people, but it was.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.180]   Oh, that was Facebook.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.340]   They, the pro public had done two different things that have ticked me off.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:08:01.580]   One was Facebook is allowing racist ads or, or black, I think, which they weren't doing
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:02.580]   it all.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:06.740]   And they didn't do, but, and then the other thing was something I was really, really upset
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:07.740]   about it.
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:09.740]   You were so right.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.380]   It said that clearly I've calmed down.
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.380]   Cause he doesn't remember it.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:17.780]   It said that, uh, the censorship rules favored hate speech from white men.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.780]   Oh, yes.
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:22.580]   Oh, I got a mad again.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:24.580]   You got him right on him again.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:27.380]   I got a mad because I said, no, I get a fight.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.380]   Just I got to find it.
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.380]   I got your tweet.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:30.380]   I put it on.
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.380]   Oh, bring my piece.
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:36.500]   I say my alternative headline was, um, yes, see the alternative headline.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:41.020]   I was like Facebook secret sensitive rules protect Muslim migrants, but not Irish teens,
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.980]   but they didn't write it.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:49.220]   It was a logic exercise of saying you have to have two categories to go into protected.
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:54.820]   So that was so, so black teens was an example of teens are protected.
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:59.940]   Blacks are it's, it's pro public has done this twice and they've really ticked me off
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:03.660]   with it because I have a lot of respect for the work that they generally do.
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:08.100]   And only the only angle when she was at the this is why, when she was at the journal,
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:12.460]   she did the whole, oh my God, what they know, what they know thing against against Google
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:16.940]   and Facebook and now the people say, a lot of that stuff was really good.
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:17.940]   She did good work with that.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:18.940]   That's very valuable stuff.
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:19.940]   It was you put in the.
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:25.180]   But I was also a lot of fear, my green and scare stuff.
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:29.860]   These two things that have really annoyed me have been because they've taken a grain
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:34.940]   of something and twisted it to get the maximum amount of outrage.
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:37.860]   And I have to say that's probably the goal.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:41.140]   And with Facebook, it caused them to change policies that potentially could have been
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:44.980]   abused, but that they didn't show any evidence were being abused.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:53.860]   Well, in the article, Angwen says, so earlier this month, the US congressman posted on Facebook
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:59.100]   that we should slaughter radicalized Muslims, hunt them, identify them and kill them.
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:03.260]   This is Clay Higgins from Louisiana, kill them all for the sake of all that is good
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:05.420]   and righteous, kill them all.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.620]   That was left up.
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:14.100]   But when a Boston poet and Black Lives Matter activist, D. Delgado tweeted all white people
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.100]   are racist.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.060]   Start from this reference point where you've already failed.
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.620]   That was removed and her account was disabled for seven days.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:23.620]   And to be clear here, I'm not going to defend the system of Facebook.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.780]   I'm not going to say that it's faultless.
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:31.820]   It's not the example she used to try to show that it was systemic rather than stupid was
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.300]   sensationalistic and wrong.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.300]   That's my point.
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:37.100]   No, Facebook messes up, witness the new pump.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.900]   And they usually fix it, right?
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:41.900]   Is that the point?
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:48.340]   The rules on where they censor, like part of, from my understanding, and I dealt with this
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:51.740]   years ago with Google when I was trying to understand why they would remove things from
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:56.220]   auto-suggestor they wouldn't, they would get all tangled up with like, well, we do it
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.900]   for protected groups, but not for unprotected groups.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:10:59.900]   You're like, what?
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:05.100]   And then you would start to get in, and I'm not a civil rights and civil protection expert.
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:10.780]   But from what I was understanding is that you would have protections under US law for
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:15.260]   protected groups, meaning groups that are being targeted or that need it.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:18.900]   So like, for example, you might have laws that would protect discrimination against
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:24.580]   women, but you wouldn't have laws that would protect discrimination against like a 19-year-old
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.580]   or something like that.
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:31.100]   It is all, like, it is confusing and it looks like they evolved their own rules to try to
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:33.580]   start off this way, and then they started adding more things.
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:38.020]   And I really want them to just have, like, we used to have this thing on our sites, we
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.580]   call it the common sense commenting policy.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:46.020]   And it was like, we will remove anything that common sense tells you you shouldn't have
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:48.980]   said or shouldn't have done, right, or the common decency.
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:52.540]   So you know, you want to have a polite discussion with someone great.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:56.300]   You do something and we think that people would use their common sense to say, yeah,
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.620]   you went over the line there, we'll pull it out.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:03.740]   And it's hard because it's really easy for us to sit back and criticize what they should
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:06.780]   have pulled this and then what they shouldn't have pulled that.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:11.180]   And that story certainly had lots of stuff in it where you're like, yeah, why are you
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.060]   doing things inconsistently?
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:18.940]   But what annoyed me the worst was their headline, which is all that a lot of people would see,
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:22.780]   gave the impression that, what was their headline again?
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:30.220]   That their policy was designed to protect white men, which it was not any more than
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:31.220]   their policy.
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.900]   It's based on this.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:37.220]   Their policy rules were not all, it makes it sound like they're designed to protect white
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:43.620]   men, not black children, but they're also protect black men, not white children, or
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:49.940]   they also protect Muslim immigrants, but not white teenage Irish kids or whatever.
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:54.140]   It's like, because you can pick and choose whatever thing combination you want.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:57.940]   But people certainly took away from that what I think they wanted to take away, what
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:01.140]   Republicans wanted to take the way, which the outrage thing.
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:05.860]   This was part of, and we talked a lot about it when it was leaked out, the Facebook rules
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.740]   for its sensors.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:12.500]   If you take any piece of it out, it does seem nonsensical.
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.220]   It's a very, it's a difficult job.
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:17.700]   It's hard to make rules that will make a lot of sense.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:23.140]   Although this is the rule that Angwin particularly quotes that gave her rise to the headlines.
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:24.140]   It was a quiz.
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.900]   But that was the other thing that ticked me off.
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:32.020]   It was like, it's a stupid quiz when you look at it in that context.
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:40.180]   But if you think about it the way that you've typically taken tests where you're trying to
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:45.060]   see if you catch someone out on it or whatever, you would immediately think most people would
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.980]   then say, "Oh, I'll show you the white men."
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.580]   You're like, "Well, we're not going to protect that."
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:51.260]   And then you're like, "No, we would because of these rules."
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:54.780]   You need to understand those rules that you can then also protect black men.
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:58.100]   You can also attack Asian men and Hispanic men.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:03.140]   It's misrepresentative to just look at this out of context because the question really
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:07.140]   is to say, do we do subsets of larger groups?
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.100]   No, we don't do subsets.
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:14.580]   Female drivers are black children, but we would do black people or women.
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:19.420]   So that's what, but out of context, this doesn't make this looks bad.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:20.420]   Exactly what it was.
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:21.420]   This is bad journalism.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:26.740]   And it was irresponsible and it continues this war on the tech companies.
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:29.740]   And Joy is a very smart person and a very good journalist, but I've had this problem
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:33.260]   with her when she was in the journal and I have a problem with her when she's a pro-publica
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:36.060]   is that it's just attacking the tech companies for the sake of attacking them.
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:37.060]   This is a hard one though.
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.900]   I agree with you both.
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:46.460]   This is a challenging article, but how is a normal person to read this and understand that
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:47.700]   it's misrepresentative?
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.260]   I don't know if that's not what this is.
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:55.260]   Danny's Facebook post did an excellent job of explaining what was wrong with this article.
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:15:02.620]   And then like I said, I think they're doing good work and they're highlighting important
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:03.620]   issues.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.620]   They're not the way I would have done it.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:06.620]   Pro-publicate.
[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:10.500]   But I probably would have done it in a way that I would have tried to figure out to
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.860]   identify the issue in a way that wasn't just designed to store outreach.
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:19.380]   But having said that, they were successful in getting Facebook to change the policy probably
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.060]   faster than they would have on the earlier thing.
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:25.420]   Even though they didn't demonstrate there was a problem, they just demonstrated potential
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.020]   of a problem.
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:29.820]   And I think that they will probably be as effective with this.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.580]   That Facebook will make some needed changes.
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.900]   And they do need to make changes.
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:36.300]   There's valuable stuff in there.
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:42.020]   I don't like the idea that they did it in a way to present it as if Facebook was somehow.
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:45.900]   And I saw many, many people tweet this that Facebook was being racist.
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:46.900]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:47.900]   Well, that was the head.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:51.820]   And that's the other damage that happens because if you read the Pro-Publica article,
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:54.380]   you might have been able to get some nuance out of it.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:16:00.020]   But all the articles that rehashed the Pro-Publica article took all the nuance out and just basically
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.500]   said Facebook's racist.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.180]   Which is exactly what they knew would happen.
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:06.180]   And again, I think Pro-Publica's great.
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.980]   I admire the hell out of them, but this was an attack job.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:10.980]   You think this is advocacy then?
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:16.060]   Generally, I'm okay with advocacy too, but I wanted it to be intellectually honest.
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:17.660]   This was intellectually dishonest.
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:18.660]   That's my problem with this.
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:22.220]   Yeah, I think the headline was intellectually dishonest.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:25.060]   I think it was probably just to get clicks.
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:29.740]   I mean, that's not Pro-Publica's because they're their model isn't to do that Stacy.
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.740]   That's the problem.
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:31.740]   That's why-
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:36.620]   Well, but so wait, because this has happened to me a lot.
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:41.620]   Having clicks isn't- it's not just for ad revenue, it's so people actually read your
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:42.620]   stuff.
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:43.620]   So I have-
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.500]   I have the worst headline writer in the entire world.
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.620]   It is really sad, but I feel like a lot of my stories are important.
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:54.420]   So I would go to people and I'd say, "Hey, can you sex this headline up for me?"
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:58.740]   Because I would like for people to actually read it.
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:06.460]   And I think Pro-Publica probably subscribes to that and they probably went far too.
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:13.020]   And they are generally- they are the cream of the cream of responsible journalism.
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:16.060]   This was intellectually irresponsible.
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:17.060]   That's all.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:19.980]   So with that Danny, I wanted to thank you for expressing it.
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.140]   You know, the problem is, let's be clear here.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:26.180]   I run- or I started the News and Darity Initiative, which got money from Facebook.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:31.300]   So my ability, I know, is limited now to say this was unfair to Facebook.
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:32.300]   I probably would have anyway.
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.940]   And it was also very hard to explain.
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:38.060]   Danny just did a far better job simply of explaining it to your point, Leo.
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.860]   How would you explain this?
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.860]   Danny did.
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:41.860]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:42.860]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:43.860]   Yeah.
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:44.860]   Call Danny.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.860]   It's- you know, I think it's hard.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:47.620]   I admire you guys because you're journalists.
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:54.260]   And it's one of those- it's like being a monk.
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:18:01.980]   You have to constantly push yourself to truth and kind of avoid the winds that are pushing
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:05.820]   you towards trying to generate traffic for good reasons.
[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:10.440]   Like I just want people to read my work, not necessarily for monetary reasons.
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.140]   But that's a hard thing to do.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:17.140]   It requires some real dedication to say, "I want to express the truth in a way that everybody
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.900]   can understand it and not misrepresent it."
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:21.620]   And the people don't feel ripped off?
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.300]   Yeah, sometimes we're having clicked.
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:26.660]   And sometimes people fail at this, you know?
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:27.660]   Yes.
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:30.260]   It's probably a very, very difficult thing to do.
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:31.260]   I know- It is.
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.380]   I know it's certainly always in the back of my mind.
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.220]   Am I misrepresenting this?
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:43.180]   I want to represent the story as best I can, as accurately as I can.
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:44.780]   And it's hard to do.
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:45.780]   Certainly-
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:46.780]   It's very interesting.
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:49.340]   I'm not a big fan of paywalls and I don't think that's a solution to everything.
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:54.220]   But I talked to The Telegraph and The Guardian in London a couple of months ago where they're
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:57.980]   each trying to convert people into giving the money.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:01.580]   They're not for premium content, not a pure paywall, just some stuff as premium.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:04.900]   And Guardian for contributions, otherwise known as begging.
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:08.340]   They've both entered into a content reduction scheme.
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.260]   Because before you, in a volume-based business, you had to have more and more and more content,
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:15.220]   more stories, more headlines, more of this, more of that.
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.540]   And you got people who came by once and never came back.
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:19.060]   It wasn't the basis of a business.
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:23.660]   So now, they're trying to, by reducing the quantity, they increase the quality.
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:24.660]   So funny.
[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:25.660]   And it's amazing-
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.940]   I learned that lesson a long time ago and I don't even have a paywall.
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:28.940]   We did that to you.
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.140]   Although I will say the information does that, right?
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:33.140]   That was there.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.980]   Yes, they do that very well.
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:39.260]   But they have since launched an aggregation newsletter.
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:40.260]   I noticed that.
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:41.780]   Because you still have to have all of that.
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.540]   I mean, we've fought this.
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:49.460]   We dealt with this every, not every day, but every quarter at GigaOM when we were like,
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:53.940]   how many stories, what quality should they be, how much time?
[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:59.220]   Because you could spend forever reporting out something really awesome.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:01.540]   You're talking about this briefing thing that they do now?
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.540]   Yes.
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:04.860]   This is still, I have to say, they pick what five articles.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:08.780]   It's not, well, actually it's more than that now, but it's not a lot.
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:11.180]   I mean, they still kind of boil it down a little bit.
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:12.700]   No, I'm not saying it's bad.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:16.340]   I'm just saying that we're still trying to figure out the bottle for-
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:17.340]   Right.
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:18.340]   Right.
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:19.340]   Yeah, we've struggled with it.
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:23.260]   We launched a bunch of shows and realized that that wasn't adding to our value and have
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.020]   cut back quite a bit.
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.020]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:33.340]   Which is, and then of course you've had the other thing that happened this week with the
[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:36.380]   newspaper willing to band together against Google and Facebook.
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.060]   Yes, as an official negotiating.
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.860]   Let's talk about that.
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:40.860]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:42.620]   Give me the story.
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:47.420]   Well, they've tried to do this a few years ago and they've come back at it.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:52.340]   Basically, they said, look, we're going to lobby Congress that we should be excluded
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:57.620]   from antitrust rules of colluding with each other because we need to be able to do that
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:01.220]   in order to get all the money that Google and Facebook have stolen away from us.
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:06.300]   It's rightfully ours because apparently somehow they were all supposed to be entitled to all
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.580]   the digital ad revenue.
[01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:10.020]   They don't have any plan.
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:13.260]   They don't have any specifics about how they would conclude.
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:17.460]   There's no idea about what it is that they think, like, I don't know.
[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:23.220]   I guess if they all get together, maybe they can then say to Facebook, you can't send us
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:27.380]   traffic anymore or we'll block your links or something.
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:28.940]   They don't know what they want to do.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:31.660]   They just want to get together and they somehow think that.
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:37.340]   But it's been effective in the sense that in Europe, they get together more often and
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:43.540]   then Google throws tens of millions here or 20 million there for some innovation thing.
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:44.540]   Aren't they the most--
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:48.940]   Are they mostly interested in just getting a good deal?
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:53.420]   Because Facebook's talking now about charging people for content.
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:57.380]   Aren't they interested in just getting a good deal when their stuff is on Facebook?
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:58.380]   But I mean, that's like--
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.620]   But what's the good deal?
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:01.620]   That's the problem.
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:05.340]   It's like, I don't know what they want to negotiate for what?
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:08.380]   So Axios has a good summary of this.
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:12.220]   The post-- I linked to the Axios post in my piece.
[01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:16.460]   Axios does a very good job, by the way, of cutting things down to the essence.
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.460]   So the--
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.460]   Yeah, the head issues with that.
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:20.460]   We're gone.
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:21.460]   All right, four things.
[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:23.260]   One is increase advertising revenue sharing, right?
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:24.260]   Negotiation.
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.300]   So we're going to go to the government and we're going to get them to pass laws against
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:27.300]   you.
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:30.060]   We're going to do nasty things unless you increase the revenue share to us.
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:33.700]   Number two, create more support for new subscription models, which they, in fact, Facebook
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:35.780]   and Google are doing.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:38.660]   Number three, improve data sharing, which I agree with.
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:41.580]   And number four, better brand support.
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.740]   So that's also coming down the pike.
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:47.100]   So really what they're doing is they're trying to create a cartel here to get tough.
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:52.780]   Now, meanwhile in France this week, there were also two new things announced-- I'm forgetting
[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:57.740]   the name of them suddenly-- that are basically-- it's also antitrust.
[01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:03.700]   It brought together all the publishers to create new ad networks so that they can get
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:10.100]   almost as big a population as-- I beg an audience.
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:11.100]   It's a Google.
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:12.500]   They're called Gravity and Skyline.
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:15.940]   And they're two big French ad networks.
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:19.620]   That requires excuse from antitrust.
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.820]   But if you're going to create your own competitor to Google, I'm cool with that.
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:27.060]   But this idea that Google is evil and bad and they should give us the money we used to
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.060]   have.
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:31.260]   No, Google gives advertisers a better deal.
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:34.220]   And the problem is they constantly expect Google and Facebook to change when the publishers
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:36.220]   refuse to change.
[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.300]   All right.
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.740]   Those are really slow to change.
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:40.740]   Good lord.
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:41.740]   Oof.
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:42.740]   Oof.
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.740]   Oof.
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:44.740]   Oof.
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:48.700]   You know who else is slow to change?
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:52.780]   Real estate appraisers.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.780]   I was waiting.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:58.220]   I was like, tell me more about your segue, Lewis.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:01.500]   This is from Max, because I just saw this as I was scrolling by trying to find the article
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.580]   you were talking about, Jeff.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:08.180]   The real estate appraisers are worried because computers do a better job.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:11.500]   Zillow is getting so good at appraising home value.
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:16.180]   There's not much need for appraisers, which is a nice, you know, solid middle class profession
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:22.900]   requires a four year degree, lots of experience, pays 40% more per hour than the median job.
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:28.420]   But in a newsletter, Brian Weaver wrote, "The future for appraisers specializing in residential
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:30.140]   mortgage work is coming to an end.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:33.500]   No bang, not even a whimper."
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:36.820]   So they're looking also to change government regulation to protect them.
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:40.300]   Agents also can't stand Zillow because it's happening everywhere.
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.660]   The classroom is your experts now, right?
[01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:49.900]   Well, so Zillow, I felt like they had, hold on, there are some, was it a study, but they
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:56.220]   were talking about the appraisals on Zillow, like a good hunk of them, like 30% were like
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:57.220]   way off.
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:00.700]   So their bell curve was not a true bell curve.
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:10.100]   So I think, and I can't remember the details, so I'm trying to look this up to figure out
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:13.660]   like, oh, that's a real estate company.
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:19.020]   I'm not going to click on that because that is not, that is probably not unbiased.
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.380]   They might have an opinion on that.
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:24.860]   Maybe it was a lawsuit, let's see.
[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:29.380]   Oh, it is a lawsuit.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:30.380]   That's what I was reading about.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:40.660]   So it's a lawsuit filed by suburban Chicago home builders against Zillow on their appraisals.
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:43.140]   And that's kind of interesting.
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:48.500]   So actually, if this lawsuit goes anywhere, maybe we'll see kind of some real research.
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.220]   So yeah, let's see.
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:53.020]   This is a market watch story.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:55.660]   Zillow's estimates mislead home buyers.
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:56.660]   Lawsuit claims yes.
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:00.780]   Again, this is a good get the courts to enforce that.
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:01.780]   That's interesting.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:03.380]   Yeah, that's.
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:07.180]   But maybe they're after it because holy cow, this is our jobs.
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:09.180]   This is a common thing.
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:13.620]   Twitter's hired a new chief financial officer.
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:14.620]   Ned Segal.
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:15.620]   Do we care?
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.620]   I don't know.
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:17.620]   Does it matter?
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:23.700]   No, there's slowly filling the chairs in the C suite.
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.500]   I feel like I'm Dvorak right now.
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:26.500]   Oh, okay.
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.940]   Who wants that news?
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:29.940]   It's not news.
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:30.940]   Who cares?
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:31.940]   Who cares?
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:36.100]   Let's see, there was some, let me, I'm scrolling through here trying to figure out because there
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:37.780]   was something I was excited about.
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:38.780]   Okay.
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:42.620]   Galaxy Note 8 might even launch as early as August 23rd.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:47.420]   I bet you the pixel in the Note 8 come out late August because honestly, once they've
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:50.060]   got a, they've got to distance themselves from the iPhone launch.
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.820]   We were talking about this earlier.
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:56.380]   So I wouldn't be surprised if they moved that release up.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:27:02.580]   You can get the Note 7 fan edition now and I think, is it Korea?
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:04.740]   It is very limited.
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:07.620]   And I don't know when they say fan, do they mean a cooling fan or do they mean you're
[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:08.700]   a fan of the product?
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:13.340]   I'm not sure which, but it's refurbished Note 7s.
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.660]   The Note 7 was an ice phone, but I haven't.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:19.860]   It has a little, Leo, I hear it has a little tiny fireworks to roll about.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.460]   The fan edition.
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:24.060]   So did anybody buy anything on Prime Day?
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:25.060]   Oh, I did.
[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:26.060]   I did.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:27.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:28.060]   Oh, Stacy, what you buying?
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:34.700]   Oh, I bought another Amazon Echo because unlike Leo, the Google show or the Google show,
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:39.380]   the Echo show is not something that my husband really loves having in our house.
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.180]   He finds it doesn't work as well.
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:42.180]   So,
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:45.020]   Oh, you already had one and tried it and he doesn't like it.
[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:46.620]   Dude, we talked on it, Leo.
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:47.620]   Oh, that's right.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:48.620]   So you sent it back?
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:50.140]   No, I've got it in my office.
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:52.020]   I'm going to move it to the office when the show come.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.020]   I love the show.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:56.780]   You got the black tube, but it is a big discount.
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:57.780]   It was $90.
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:59.460]   It was a great price.
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:00.460]   I got it too.
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:02.900]   I've never had an Echo, so I got one.
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.380]   It's about time Jeffrey.
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.620]   Well, go to the world.
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:07.460]   Jeff, I have all kinds of things for you.
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:08.460]   The dot was even cheaper.
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:09.460]   What was the dot?
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:10.460]   $35.
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:11.460]   Oh, look.
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:12.460]   Yeah, but the dots.
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:13.780]   Jeff's got a Google home.
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:15.540]   That was the best selling product.
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:16.540]   Yeah.
[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:21.700]   Which is no surprise because virtually any category you went into for prime would be
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:22.700]   like that.
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:24.700]   Don't you want to buy it?
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:31.780]   Homeware dot bathroom supplies dot clothing.
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:33.500]   I did not buy an instant pot.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.500]   It was close.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:39.180]   I almost bought an instant pot, but then I realized I have a Breville fast slow cooker.
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.180]   It's the same things.
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:41.820]   I don't need an instant pot.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.900]   That's just slow cooking now in the gym.
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:45.180]   Yeah, but I could do both.
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:46.180]   I get slow cooking.
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:47.180]   It's a pressure cooker.
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:50.900]   And I can also a fast cook because it can brown and it does everything.
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:54.780]   And I don't need an instant pot, but that just shows you the power of prime day.
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:55.980]   I almost bought it.
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:58.260]   Instead I bought a sous vide set up setup.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:02.980]   I spent probably an hour going through age of the page or the page.
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:03.980]   There's nothing.
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:04.980]   No, fair little.
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:08.780]   In fact, if it wasn't an Amazon appliance, it's not a great deal.
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:13.340]   Your publication, and I like saying your publication Stacey because you've been writing for the
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:17.940]   wire cutter every year does an analysis of prime day.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.740]   I'm trying to find their analysis this year.
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:26.260]   It was pathetic that the number of deals, 25,000, the number of actual savings deals
[01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:33.460]   here it is, the best deals of the day after scanning thousands of prime deals.
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:37.620]   I think that like several hundred were good out of the tens of thousands off.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.620]   What was good?
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:39.620]   What was good?
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:40.620]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:45.620]   You know, you really got to be in the market for that.
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:48.620]   The Nvidia Shield, that would be good.
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.620]   See, it's $200 normally.
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:54.420]   I don't know what it was on prime day, but that I like the Shield.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:55.420]   I'd recommend that.
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:59.020]   Google Home and Chromecast Streaming, refurbished Roku stick.
[01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:00.620]   Don't recommend it.
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:02.620]   Tiled Bluetooth tracker.
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.620]   Oh, that was half off.
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:05.620]   Half off.
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:06.620]   Yeah, scroll up.
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:08.620]   The logo is blocking you now.
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:09.620]   Thank you.
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:10.620]   Topo.
[01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:15.620]   Amazon sold 60% more.
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:19.220]   It was the biggest sales day in its history, up 60% over 2016.
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:25.180]   So even if the deal sucked, people still were like, yeah, prime day, which by the way,
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:27.620]   y'all also slurpee day at 7/11.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:29.620]   Ooh, that's a tough.
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:31.620]   Oh, that's a tough choice.
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:38.620]   My favorite tweet of the day yesterday, bemoaned that prime day has now become so commercial.
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:43.620]   How many students do you know?
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:46.980]   It used to be a deeply religious holiday.
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:49.620]   And now it's just about buying stuff.
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:50.620]   7,000.
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:52.620]   Oh, no, that was the best one from last year.
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:59.620]   Someone said, I remember when prime day was a celebration, a transformer of Optimus Prime.
[01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:01.620]   Oh, that Prime.
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:07.620]   7,950 deals scanned of the 7,950.
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:11.500]   The car cutter said it's only 64 were a good deal.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.500]   Wow.
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:15.900]   So in fact, some things cost more on prime day.
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:18.620]   They actually raised the price on prime day.
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.620]   Wow.
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:24.620]   You know, I did go looking for the Putin Trump gold phone on prime day.
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:26.100]   Oh, couldn't get it.
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:29.620]   Yeah, we talked about that last week, boy, was that a butte.
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:30.620]   Didn't we?
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:31.620]   We talked about that last week, right?
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:32.620]   Do we?
[01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:33.620]   I don't think we talked about it.
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:34.620]   Oh, we talked about it.
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:35.620]   We're here.
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:36.620]   Right.
[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:38.340]   The actual phone made by there it is.
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:39.340]   A Russian.
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:41.020]   It was a Nokia 3310.
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:42.020]   So don't laugh at it.
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:43.020]   That's a modern phone.
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.420]   Well, it's not a smartphone.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:46.820]   It is modern.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:47.820]   And look at that.
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:54.100]   It has a metal symbolizing the G20 summit between Vladimir Putin and our president.
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:32:02.420]   There they are featured in profile on the gold coin with lovely gray wood accents.
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:05.780]   And it's only 2,500 bucks.
[01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:07.780]   But I bet you'll be able to get cheaper soon.
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:08.780]   Somehow.
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:11.500]   Somehow, I think maybe not.
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:14.300]   That could be quite a momento someday.
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:15.300]   Okay.
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:16.300]   Okay.
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:19.300]   You know, anything else?
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:25.180]   You wouldn't show porn stars support net neutrality.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:27.100]   So you know, that's my best I had to offer.
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:29.060]   That was as good as it gets.
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:30.060]   That was it.
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:34.740]   There was the world's tiniest Google Street View car.
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:35.740]   I saw that.
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:36.740]   That was cute.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:37.740]   It's cute.
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:38.740]   It's very cute.
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:39.740]   It's not a real one.
[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:40.740]   Well, there was a camera on it.
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:41.740]   Oh, it does.
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:45.140]   I thought it was like just a model in a, is it all?
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.140]   Oh, no.
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:48.740]   And then there's Shrashstein Castle there.
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:51.340]   Oh, how do you pronounce that?
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:52.340]   Nuh, Shrashstein.
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:53.340]   Nuh, Shrashstein.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:54.340]   Nuh, Shrashstein.
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:58.900]   That's a crazy, crazy Ludwig's castle in Bavaria.
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:32:59.900]   No, it's not.
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:00.900]   It's obviously not real.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:01.900]   Sorry.
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:02.900]   Oh, I got this.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:03.900]   I thought about it.
[01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:04.900]   It's like, there, Jeff.
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:05.900]   Yeah.
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:06.900]   Yeah.
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.900]   Oh, well, but it's cute.
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:12.420]   Oh, yeah, it's adorable.
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:16.020]   Germans, the Germans are filing suits against Google because of this.
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:17.020]   Exactly.
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:18.020]   Plastic people.
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.020]   Exactly.
[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:21.900]   That's with T's so great.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:27.660]   Google has not asked for the permission of these small miniature people to have them
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:28.660]   on the speed test.
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:29.660]   We do.
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:30.660]   We do.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.660]   We also did it against them.
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.740]   Sorry, I went on French, I guess.
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:36.260]   No, I can't do accents.
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:38.820]   I know one of the Europeans hate us.
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:39.820]   Those.
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:40.820]   Best buy suit.
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:45.300]   Well, Fuzzy, I don't know what the hell happened, but as soon as I said that my broadband was
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:47.460]   great, it's just crap.
[01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:48.460]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.460]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:52.540]   Happy net neutrality day there, Danny.
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:54.100]   It's fine on my phone though.
[01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:55.100]   Oh, you're fine.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:57.620]   On my wife's top is to leave my desk.
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:59.420]   Everything on my desktops come to a grinding halt.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.700]   I don't know why.
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:06.180]   So I didn't realize this, but Amazon is building a competitor to the Geek Squad.
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:07.180]   Best buys--
[01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:08.180]   Well, I didn't know that either.
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:09.180]   Yeah, they're serving strong.
[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:10.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:11.180]   Look at the graph.
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:12.260]   This is Best Buy stock price.
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:13.660]   That announcement comes out.
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:14.660]   BOW!
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:17.100]   Like a cliff.
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.620]   Best Buy lost a billion dollars in market value.
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:24.660]   And by the way, I'm amazed Best Buy has a billion dollars to lose in market value.
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:25.660]   Kevin Toes don't look--
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:26.660]   Well, he's going less.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:30.180]   I was going to say he used to go to Best Buy all the time.
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:31.180]   Used to.
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:34.940]   Well, even up till six months ago.
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:39.460]   Did Kevin talk on your show about his announcement?
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:41.860]   We didn't talk on the show about--
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:44.460]   So I won't say anything until we get him on.
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:46.820]   Just as I didn't mention anything about Danny Sullivan's announcement.
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:51.060]   But Kevin apparently has moved on from Google and we'll get him on.
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:52.900]   Now we can get him on because he's not at Google anymore.
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:53.900]   We can get him on.
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:54.900]   That's true.
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.140]   And I talked about that this morning.
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:57.140]   We'd love to.
[01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:58.140]   Oh, good.
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:59.140]   That'd be great.
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:02.380]   Because we weren't allowed to talk to him while he was--
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:04.340]   He wasn't a staff employee.
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:05.980]   He was a consultant there, right?
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:08.660]   He was a consultant.
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:12.460]   But I told him actually because I'm going to go on vacation.
[01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:14.180]   And I was like, Kevin, you could just be me.
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.180]   I mean, you'd be Kevin.
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.020]   Can you leave the dress?
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:18.220]   And he can die his--
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:19.580]   He's going to wear his Beatles shirt.
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.080]   He's a Beatles.
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.940]   He's a serious Beatles guy.
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.900]   Yes, when are you going on vacation?
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:29.220]   Sometimes in a couple weeks, Seattle.
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:30.460]   Oh, have fun.
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:32.980]   Well, sometimes I was going to do at least one show from Seattle.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:33.940]   Yeah, you must.
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:34.940]   If you can't--
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:35.940]   One day I'm going to be whale watching.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:36.780]   So, whoo, whoo.
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:37.900]   Fun.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:39.780]   So you're not going to be doing any work-no conferences
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:40.420]   or anything up there.
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:42.540]   Just--
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:43.020]   No work.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:44.500]   I might do office hours.
[01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.020]   Oh.
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:46.860]   Office hours.
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:48.260]   That's the problem when you own your business.
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:50.820]   You can never really take any time off.
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:51.820]   Nope.
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:55.220]   We talked about it yesterday on security now.
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:56.740]   Steve Gibson was fairly upset.
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:58.260]   I am too.
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:00.660]   W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium,
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:04.060]   which was created and run by Tim Berners-Lee and others.
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:06.100]   But Tim, of course, the inventor of the World Wide Web,
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:08.300]   probably has a pretty big voice there.
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:10.860]   They've been debating back and forth, adding extensions
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:15.580]   to the web specification for HTML5,
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:19.420]   extensions that would enable copy protection.
[01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:23.940]   And they have decided to do it, although it is currently
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:24.900]   open for comments.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:29.780]   So maybe if everybody said, no, don't do it,
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:32.420]   the encrypted media extensions would let content providers
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:35.060]   encrypt and protect audio and video content
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:38.260]   within their plug-in free HTML and JavaScript application.
[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:40.140]   So what you have to do it right now, of course,
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.900]   if you're going to watch Netflix, you have to download
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:42.740]   special stuff.
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.020]   You're going to watch-- otherwise,
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:47.020]   you can't, because they can't protect the content.
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:50.700]   I think that Tim Berners-Lee's feeling was, well,
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:53.700]   we got to do it because otherwise, you know,
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:57.940]   the world is fragmented with all these web plug-ins.
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:02.140]   But the Electronic Frontier Foundation and many others
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:04.060]   didn't like this idea in particular,
[01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:10.660]   because it would prevent, thanks to the DMCA,
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:14.020]   prevent researchers from examining how they work,
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:17.380]   looking for security issues.
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:23.660]   And Tim wasn't even willing to allow a little bit of that.
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:31.540]   So in any way, it's a bit of a controversy.
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:34.780]   No compromise was allowed.
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:38.060]   I wish Kevin Marks was here, because I sit there
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:42.740]   and I feel like this kind of controversy makes me,
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:45.700]   I don't know, long for the original days of the early web.
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:47.420]   But the web has broken.
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:52.300]   It has been broken since we introduced mobile everywhere.
[01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:54.420]   And flash exists because of this.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.780]   You know, that's why flash exists, one of the reasons,
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:59.260]   is for copy protection and silver light.
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:00.500]   So they don't want that.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.540]   They want to get rid of those days, right?
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:04.660]   Everything's HTML5.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:07.420]   I can understand that point.
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:10.820]   I feel like the open web has died and we should--
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:11.740]   I know.
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:13.780]   So many things have died, Stacy.
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:15.780]   Morn it and move on and accept,
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.700]   but Kevin would disagree with me.
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:19.740]   No, he wants to save it.
[01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:20.140]   I know.
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:21.500]   He would have a lot to say about this.
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.260]   Steve had a lot to say about it.
[01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:25.420]   We'll leave you--
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:26.140]   Go look that up.
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:28.940]   --to go look that up, exactly.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:31.220]   So one of the things that's going on right now,
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:34.660]   a couple of weeks ago, Apple's iTunes,
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:37.220]   Apple announced that it was going to keep track of how
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:42.340]   much of a podcast people listened to.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:43.220]   Uh-oh.
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:47.260]   And now the IAB, the Interactive Advertising Bureau,
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:52.020]   is contemplating rules to encourage all podcast players
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:53.620]   to keep track of this information,
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:56.380]   because advertisers would very much like to know,
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:58.660]   not merely if you downloaded it, but how much of it
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:38:59.900]   you listened to.
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.300]   Now this is, of course, an informational--
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:01.740]   An information that--
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:03.460]   They can't get from magazines.
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:04.660]   They can't get from newspapers.
[01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:06.220]   You know, that's all they can--
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:07.860]   How do they get a podcast that are downloaded?
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:08.300]   You would have--
[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.980]   Well, and this is my problem.
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:12.620]   iTunes can do it because you use iTunes to listen.
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:15.540]   You would have to use software that enabled it.
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:19.020]   And the IAB is hoping that all the manufacturers of podcast
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:22.940]   apps will start building in this approved system.
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:24.540]   And I certainly hope not.
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:27.220]   And I know our listeners don't like the idea
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:31.180]   that people would be keeping track of their listening habits.
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:34.140]   However, it would be-- I think it'd
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:39.060]   be bad for podcasting, because inevitably it would drive rates
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:40.860]   down.
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:43.700]   Because you don't--
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:45.940]   Because we know people don't listen.
[01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:47.260]   Right.
[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:48.780]   Well, you know the number of people
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:50.660]   listening is somewhat lower than the number of people
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:51.220]   to download.
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:52.220]   It could be a lot lower.
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:53.140]   We don't know.
[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:54.060]   And now I--
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:56.660]   But in the case of Twit, you also
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:58.940]   have the poor prisoner listeners, the wives,
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:00.740]   listening next to the geek husbands in the car.
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:02.540]   There's all sorts of problems with it.
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:03.540]   You know--
[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:05.540]   It's a terrible listener.
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:06.540]   Or the opposite.
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:09.500]   We have a lot of listeners who don't believe in tracking
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:12.940]   and will seek out ways to listen that isn't tracked.
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.020]   So we'll have a disproportionate number of listeners
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:16.300]   who aren't counted.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:17.940]   There's also some problems with it.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.740]   The real problem is that-- and I
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.100]   knew this would happen two years ago.
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:23.740]   Remember everybody was all excited about podcasts.
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:24.300]   They're back.
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:28.540]   It's a renaissance, mostly because big name brands,
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:31.620]   like NPR, started doing really well with their podcasts.
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:33.460]   And then, of course, advertisers
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:34.300]   discover podcasts.
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:37.700]   And then as soon as there's money, then all of this starts.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.620]   And it's the corporatization of what
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:44.980]   has been up to now, a very free willing and relaxed medium.
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:46.460]   I hope it doesn't continue.
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:49.780]   The nice thing is-- and this will be a question--
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:51.460]   this will be a question of business models--
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:57.300]   is, can you, with this data that advertisers will seek,
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:00.260]   can you engage your audience or get them other ways?
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:03.780]   Like, I know that giving user access codes actually
[01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:06.420]   is fairly successful because it doesn't bloop
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:08.420]   or have an entire strategy around that.
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:10.740]   Yeah, well, that's the point is our advertisers,
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:13.300]   and most podcast advertisers do what's called direct response
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:17.500]   advertising, where you go to blueapron.com/twig,
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.180]   and they count that.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:22.900]   But ultimately, all advertisers really care about is, well,
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:26.100]   we bought $10,000 of ads, and we generated $20,000 worth
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:26.740]   of new business.
[01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:28.380]   That was worth it.
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:30.060]   That's really all that matters.
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:36.540]   This other stuff is kind of messy because it might lead them
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:40.940]   to say, well, we only want to pay $5,000 for those $20,000
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:42.020]   worth of results.
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:43.420]   We produce good results.
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:45.780]   Our advertisers wouldn't come back,
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:48.500]   but this would be used to drive prices down.
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:50.340]   Actually, I'm not worried for us so much,
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:53.220]   but it will hurt young new podcasts
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:55.860]   who don't have the kind of audience
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.500]   and advertising success that we do.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.540]   Ta-da!
[01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:01.540]   We'll be fine.
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:02.660]   I don't think it'd affect us at all.
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:03.740]   We can prove that we work.
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:06.980]   People make money off the ads.
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:08.620]   I don't know.
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:12.500]   I want to say 60-something percent of my audience
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:15.780]   doesn't use iTunes, which I find surprising is all good.
[01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:17.860]   Well, that's part of the problem, is it Apple?
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:21.100]   Ours is less than half.
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:25.020]   And of course, it's bad for podcasts like ours
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:26.220]   with sophisticated listeners.
[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:31.020]   It's good for podcasts that like cereal, where it's mostly
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:34.220]   iTunes, because they have a lot, they've brought in a lot of new listeners.
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:37.380]   So Apple's numbers will be more accurate for them.
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:39.900]   But Apple's numbers really won't reflect your
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:41.580]   listenership or mine.
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:43.500]   I know nobody really cares about this,
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.500]   but we mentioned put a pin in it.
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.500]   But you and I.
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:49.660]   We care, because we're trying to make a live and do in this.
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:51.500]   Because I got gadgets to buy.
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.180]   Hang on, buy some gadgets.
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:55.940]   And the truth is, the truth is that the advertisers
[01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:58.260]   have already made their own discounts for this.
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:42:59.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:05.500]   So it's not as if this has been the case for years and years and years.
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:07.500]   I go back to the myth of mass media.
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.500]   The myth of mass media is class.
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:10.780]   Is it all readers see all ads?
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:12.420]   So we charge all advertisers for all readers.
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:13.420]   That's right.
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:14.420]   That was beautiful while it lasted.
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:18.780]   And that's why you needed to audit the circulation of a publication.
[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:23.540]   But TV God was seen to have two readers per copy.
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:27.420]   People had eight readers per copy in this indicated research.
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:30.500]   Eight readers read every copy of people.
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:33.500]   And that's what they charged the advertisers for in the audience.
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.140]   advertisers knew that was BS.
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:36.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:37.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:41.260]   I mean, I understand why advertisers would like better numbers.
[01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:42.780]   They always want more data.
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:43.780]   Yeah.
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:45.300]   And they'll because it also discounts it for them.
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:48.740]   That's the main thing is I fear that they'll use that to discount it.
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:50.460]   We've got a nice little thing going here.
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:51.460]   They're happy.
[01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:52.460]   We're happy.
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:54.780]   Let's not add facts to the issues.
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:44:00.060]   Well, this is so this is the challenge of increasing data across all businesses.
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:02.020]   We're going to see this everywhere.
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:03.980]   You're I call it the end of the deal.
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:10.900]   But in some ways it's it's just I mean, are you ready for liquidity information liquidity?
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:11.900]   So I don't know.
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:12.900]   Is that Andrew?
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:13.900]   Hello, Andrew.
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:14.900]   He looks good.
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:15.900]   He looks good.
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:16.900]   He's good looking man.
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:17.900]   Andrew, come back.
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:18.900]   Andrew, come back.
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:24.980]   Shouldn't he been drawing on the floor to pull somebody out?
[01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:27.420]   Just opportunity.
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:29.220]   He may not want to be introduced.
[01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:30.220]   He's cute.
[01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:31.220]   That was cute.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:32.220]   He want to be introduced.
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:33.220]   That was a nice little candy.
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:34.940]   Yeah, we want to meet Andrew.
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:35.940]   Come here, Andrew.
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:39.220]   There's the lucky man.
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.220]   Hello.
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:44.980]   He looks everybody's sweet and kind as you've said many times over and over on this show.
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:46.980]   They're saying nice things.
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.780]   Oh, he doesn't buy it.
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:49.780]   That's nice.
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:50.780]   She can stay.
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:51.780]   She can stay.
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:54.780]   We won't fight with the dogs.
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:57.940]   This very much is like that BBC guy.
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:58.940]   Yeah.
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:44:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:01.900]   Well, he was bringing in something.
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:04.940]   So the iPhone we found it my daughter's backpack.
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:07.100]   So how did that happen?
[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:08.660]   Oh, really?
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:09.660]   Really?
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:15.100]   Jeff's kids grew up after the before the phone.
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:16.100]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:20.700]   So, Facebook's going to sell advertising inside Messenger.
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:21.700]   Are you happy?
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:22.700]   Are you happy now?
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:24.500]   A lot of people use that.
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.500]   I would.
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:26.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:29.900]   That's a big wub of money is going to fall to them right off the bat.
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:34.780]   I have to give Facebook some credit and Instagram their subsidiary brand some credit.
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:36.940]   Those ads work.
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:40.220]   I find myself buying a lot of stuff from Facebook and Instagram.
[01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:44.260]   Whereas a lot of the ads I see on other places just I don't even see them.
[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:49.140]   I got an ad from Google yesterday and Facebook offering me a special offer.
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:52.060]   I could get Google Home for only $99.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:54.180]   And you noticed on Prime Day.
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:55.180]   Yeah.
[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:58.620]   I did only because I'm like, wow, I've got a Google side.
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:00.060]   They need to advertise on Facebook.
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:01.140]   It's not interesting.
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:02.140]   Yeah.
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:03.140]   Isn't that it?
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:04.140]   It works.
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:09.180]   The other thing Leo is that we did a study at CUNY together with Contently where we looked
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:11.780]   at proper labeling of advertisers.
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:17.300]   And the label that most works, most people most understand is sponsored.
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:18.300]   Yeah.
[01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:20.100]   And it's the label that Facebook has trained us to do.
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:21.100]   Yeah.
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:24.100]   So people understood what an ad was on Facebook better than on media sites.
[01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:28.820]   I'm very encouraged by the fact that people are starting to understand that it's okay
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:32.980]   to advertise label that an ad and it's not okay not to my son.
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:33.980]   Right.
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:35.860]   22 year old son said it's cheesy.
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:38.140]   So Snapchat ads all that native content.
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:39.140]   It's cheesy.
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:40.140]   I don't like it.
[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:41.140]   He knows the difference.
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:43.980]   I also saw a study or skeevy.
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:45.860]   Skeevy or skeevy.
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:49.580]   I don't know what the exact consonant is in the middle there.
[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:57.220]   And then he, I also saw a study that said that when you use sex in advertising, it is
[01:46:57.220 --> 01:47:01.980]   counterproductive that people remember it, but they don't remember the brand.
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:06.700]   And when they do remember their brand, they think less highly of it because you've played
[01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:08.300]   the sexy card.
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:12.140]   And I was very encouraged by both of those facts.
[01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:14.820]   People, people, consumers know the difference.
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:19.380]   And I think that's why Facebook and Instagram works every 10th Instagram post.
[01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:20.380]   There's an ad.
[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:21.380]   You know it's an ad.
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:22.500]   It's clearly labeled as an ad.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:23.940]   You can scroll by it.
[01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:25.500]   There's not a thousand ads.
[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:26.820]   There's one.
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:28.220]   I think that works very well.
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:31.060]   It's very effective.
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:33.020]   Just saying.
[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:34.020]   Is it just me?
[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:35.020]   Maybe it's just me.
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:37.140]   Well, no, it is good.
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:40.700]   If people are getting, although it's interesting because on the one hand you have people getting
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:44.380]   savvier about when they're being manipulated and you still have surveys to say people don't
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:46.700]   recognize what ads are.
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:50.260]   You know, well, you would see that all the time with the search results like, well, I
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:51.260]   don't know that that was an ad.
[01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:52.260]   I didn't recognize that.
[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:55.740]   But then again, you know, those are a little harder to see.
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:58.620]   Those are the professors Google didn't pay.
[01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.820]   Exactly.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:01.820]   Exactly.
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:03.940]   That's why Microsoft paid.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:04.940]   Yeah.
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:09.580]   All right, I think we can move on unless you guys have anything I've left out.
[01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:11.740]   Just one curiosity.
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:15.020]   What does what does what does Stephen, you think of Kaspersky?
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:16.500]   Kaspersky lab.
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:17.660]   Well, you know, it's ironic.
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:21.460]   John C. Devorak used to recommend Kaspersky all the time.
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:25.220]   I mean, like that was his favorite antivirus company.
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:30.700]   I was never a big fan because Kaspersky held on longer than anybody to this idea that
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:35.860]   you could use a virus definition file and scan for strings and that would be enough.
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:39.220]   They were the slowest to adopt more advanced technologies.
[01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:44.500]   And now I think it's become clear that Kaspersky has been working with Russian intelligence.
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:51.660]   In fact, didn't didn't Congress just say that you couldn't who can't use Kaspersky anymore
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:55.140]   in their in their some government purchases.
[01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:59.220]   I can't remember what the story was, but I've met Eugene Kaspersky and Davos.
[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:00.220]   What do you think?
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:01.900]   Oh, nice guy.
[01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:04.100]   I think he knows the D word.
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:05.100]   I know.
[01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:06.100]   Sorry.
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:14.940]   Kaspersky says it's a pawn in the US Russia geopolitical game, but the United States is
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:17.300]   banned.
[01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:24.820]   The GSA has banned Kaspersky Labs antivirus software from US government systems and networks
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:28.220]   because of the concern of espionage.
[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:32.700]   Not that the antivirus doesn't work, but that it might be bearing other malware loads.
[01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:35.100]   It works fine for Donald Trump, Jr.
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:36.100]   Yeah.
[01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:41.500]   Kaspersky lab has not ties to any government and the company has never helped no real hope
[01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:44.460]   any government in the world with its savior.
[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:46.620]   You can take access to us.
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:47.620]   Exactly.
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:49.180]   Oh, Leah's very good.
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:50.380]   I go all over the place.
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:54.340]   The company is being on just a world tour with Leo.
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:55.940]   Okay, real quick.
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:56.940]   Germany.
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:01.220]   So communication was misinterpreted or manipulated.
[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:06.420]   Yeah, he regularly cooperated the enforcement agents.
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:07.420]   Israel.
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:08.660]   I'm not going to do Israel.
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:09.660]   Let's do risky.
[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:10.660]   Ireland.
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:12.900]   No, then it's tough.
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:13.900]   Come on.
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:14.900]   You're just making everybody crazy.
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:19.940]   Although I have been tempted to you see that the ways app now allows you to add custom
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:22.940]   voices of your own voice if you want to your navigation.
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:23.940]   Wow.
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:24.940]   Catch it up to Tom.
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:25.940]   You're fine.
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:27.940]   No, I'm not catching up to Tom.
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:30.380]   Yeah, but could you add your own voice with Tom?
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:33.380]   I know you could add celebrity voices, but no, you have one.
[01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:38.300]   In fact, I have it in my drawer because it's the only way for me to preserve my kids saying,
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:39.300]   turn right, turn left.
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:41.980]   So you could record here on that school.
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:43.340]   So I guess it's in the sound settings.
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:44.340]   I haven't done it yet.
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:49.420]   What I'm going to try to figure out is if if you can package them up and offer them to
[01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:51.140]   other people because I'd love to.
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:53.940]   We'd love to have Jeff Jarvis saying, what are you doing?
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.740]   Always turn left.
[01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:56.740]   Kind of good.
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.740]   Oh, I'd like that.
[01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:00.700]   Yeah, it's in the way.
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:03.180]   So when you go to voice, yeah, wouldn't that be fun?
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:04.900]   Everything you do is a left turn.
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:09.180]   So we'll left me when you go in the left.
[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:10.180]   Turn left.
[01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:11.180]   Turn left.
[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:13.420]   No, right turns.
[01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:18.180]   If when you go into voice directions, there's a new thing that says record new voice.
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:19.260]   Oh, that's great.
[01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:21.900]   And and be extra clear for safety.
[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:24.100]   Don't be screwing around.
[01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:26.620]   And then it tells you what you should record.
[01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:29.820]   So it's quite a bit, right?
[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:34.180]   You know, and so waiting for this gets saved to the cloud or somewhere.
[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:35.820]   So it stays with your settings.
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:38.740]   Because that's a lot of work to set all those things up.
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:40.660]   And you only have a customer mystery.
[01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:46.740]   There's going to be a CSI where somebody goes in and records go right when it's really
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:47.740]   go left.
[01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:55.940]   Well, actually, I had on my Tom Tom, a Glados from the game portal, the evil computer.
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:59.660]   And she would always tell you the wrong direction.
[01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:01.300]   And then she'd say, there's cake.
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.540]   But you know, I mean, it was great.
[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:04.460]   I loved Glados.
[01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:06.820]   So I thought I'd do it as a surfer, dude.
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:07.820]   All set.
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:09.060]   Let's go.
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.740]   We're all set.
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:12.500]   Start driving, man.
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:13.660]   Let's get started.
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.740]   We could have this is this is this is perfect.
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:23.100]   I enabled that on my Amazon Echo because of I think it was like the finding Nemo ad thing.
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:25.940]   You did get the surfer due to wake you up.
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:29.500]   It's like, Hey, man, it's time to get up.
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:33.140]   And my husband was like Andrew, he was very patient.
[01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:34.140]   He turned to me.
[01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:35.140]   He said, never, never.
[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:40.860]   I also had Dennis Hopper on my Tom, Tom.
[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:42.500]   That was kind of trippy.
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:45.700]   Why would anyone want to go here?
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:46.700]   It was.
[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:51.700]   So anyway, that's a nice feature now in in ways.
[01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:52.700]   Thank you.
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:55.100]   I wish this is what we need everything to do, right?
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:59.860]   We should be able to record our own Echo voices and Google home voices and everything.
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:02.820]   I would I would love to do I've always wanted to do voiceover work.
[01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:04.220]   You have a beautiful voice.
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:07.780]   You have a very rich deep voice.
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:09.940]   And you would be great for that.
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:13.140]   So a company just raised $18 million.
[01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:16.300]   It's called voice, I think it's voices.com to do voiceover work.
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:18.580]   And I had to say, I'm very excited about it.
[01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:19.580]   Do it.
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:20.580]   You've got a good microphone.
[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:21.580]   I do.
[01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:22.580]   Thank you.
[01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:25.700]   You could totally do this.
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:31.700]   And yeah, I'll be I'd be cautious about these.
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:36.700]   There've been other things like this before where you sign up and do voice work and it's
[01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:37.700]   not.
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:39.700]   Yeah, but well, there's there's a company called spoken layer.
[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:41.700]   Have you heard of them?
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:49.980]   Every interesting company I saw at the beta works lab day and and and I saw them earlier.
[01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:54.980]   They're really good guys and they enable the spoken web.
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:59.660]   So a third of the news content on Google home is their platform.
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:03.340]   And so they do some computer voice, but a lot of human voice.
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:07.140]   And so magazine articles, all kinds of these companies can go to them and then they have
[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:11.220]   a platform that Stacy, you could go in and you can get paid.
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:15.300]   Doing their there was there was an app I used I loved Lisa and I both used all the time
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:19.860]   called you, umano that had humans reading articles.
[01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:20.860]   Same idea.
[01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:21.860]   This is this.
[01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:26.740]   Yeah, what players are this is it's it's it's B2B to the companies.
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:28.260]   And it's really interesting.
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:29.260]   Nice guys.
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:31.660]   Great guys.
[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:35.460]   So you could it says get on a lack get on echo Google home now.
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:37.380]   I don't I'm going to find out more about this.
[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:38.540]   I would love to do this.
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:40.500]   Oh, you can audition.
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:43.020]   Stacy, you can audition.
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:48.660]   So once your audio is ready, so you could either read Zelda, Breath of the Wild DLC review,
[01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:52.140]   North Korea successfully test missiles that could reach Alaska.
[01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:53.540]   I'll do that Russian.
[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:59.540]   North Korea celebrated on Tuesday is it claimed to have successfully test launched to countries
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:05.820]   first intercontinental ballistic missile.
[01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:10.980]   So you read that and then that's a slate article and then send it to them.
[01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:13.180]   Thoughts and tips.
[01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:15.500]   Everyone deserves to have their name pronounced correctly.
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:19.140]   Please look up any words or names you don't find familiar.
[01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:22.180]   Think podcaster not broadcaster.
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:26.220]   Imagine you're speaking to an audience of one.
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:27.780]   You're not talking like this.
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:28.780]   Yes.
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:29.780]   Do not proclaim.
[01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:34.060]   There's a guy who does all the all the serious commercials and I hear them all the times.
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:39.820]   I listen to him, he's in the car and he says, business says.
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:41.540]   I have some pet peeves.
[01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:44.460]   I have definitely some pet peeves about people.
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:49.100]   I won't name names, but I just sometimes go crazy when I hear some of the announces on
[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:52.060]   various places.
[01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:56.180]   The other company you might like in your devices is called Earplay.
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:57.940]   What's that?
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:56:03.060]   And a creative platform for publishing interactive audio experiences and families actually stay
[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:05.140]   asleep by the way.
[01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:06.940]   They're finding families like to do with their kids.
[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:08.660]   It's like the old radio.
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:12.140]   But you stop and then say, well, should they go left or should they go right?
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:15.020]   Should they pick up the life or not pick up the knife or whatever?
[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:16.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:17.580]   Oh, choose your own adventure via voice.
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:18.580]   How fun is that?
[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:19.580]   Really?
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:20.580]   I find those really.
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:21.580]   I hate it.
[01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:22.580]   I don't like that.
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:23.580]   I never liked that.
[01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:25.780]   My husband liked them.
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:26.780]   For what that's worth.
[01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:27.780]   Oh, closet.
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:28.780]   Sorry.
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:29.780]   Ignore me.
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:31.820]   I'm setting up a gadget for you.
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:33.380]   All right, I'll do an ad.
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:36.180]   And then we'll come back and Danny, if you have a pick and it can be anything, it could
[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:37.740]   be a surfboard you like.
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:38.740]   Oh, anything.
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:43.900]   Because it's your favorite taco shop in San Diego, whatever you're in the mood for.
[01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:45.060]   Not a Google pick.
[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:46.060]   Just any pick.
[01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:47.060]   Anything.
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:48.060]   Anything.
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:49.300]   Because Danny, you're now a man of leisure.
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:51.980]   You don't have to pick stuff from your...
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:54.020]   You can pick your favorite sunset.
[01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:55.820]   What movies have you seen lately?
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:56.820]   Anything.
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:57.820]   A book that you like.
[01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:58.820]   Big sick.
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:56:59.820]   Big sick.
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:00.820]   Big sick.
[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:01.820]   It's a big sick.
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:02.820]   It's a big sick.
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:03.820]   It's a big sick.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:04.820]   We're doing a big wedding.
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:05.820]   We're doing a big wedding.
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:14.820]   My big Greek wedding, except he is not getting married and he is Muslim and she is going to
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:15.820]   get a couple of off.
[01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:16.820]   Oh, it's a season sorry.
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:20.820]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they don't all look like
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:21.820]   Leah.
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:23.540]   Well, he looks just like a season sorry.
[01:57:23.540 --> 01:57:24.540]   It's not a season sorry.
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:25.540]   He does it.
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:26.540]   He looks totally different.
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:27.540]   It's a...
[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:28.540]   He's the guy from Silicon Valley.
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:29.540]   Oh, that's who I'm thinking of.
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:30.540]   Yeah.
[01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:31.540]   Well, no, no, no, no, Jani.
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:32.540]   No, that's just made it worse.
[01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:33.540]   That's just made it worse.
[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:35.540]   Yeah, big sick.
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:36.540]   Oh, I can't win.
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:37.540]   I just can't win.
[01:57:37.540 --> 01:57:38.540]   Oh, you can't.
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:39.540]   Oh, you can't.
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:40.540]   Oh, you can't.
[01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:41.540]   Boys will be boys.
[01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:42.540]   It's really good.
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:43.540]   And that's Emily.
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:44.540]   Emily.
[01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:45.540]   No, that's not.
[01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:46.540]   Never mind.
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:47.540]   Well, the girl.
[01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:48.540]   The other.
[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:49.540]   Gordon.
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:50.540]   The big sick.
[01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:51.540]   So you guys have seen this?
[01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:52.540]   She's not in it.
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:53.540]   She didn't play herself.
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:58:00.540]   There's other actress.
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:01.540]   Oh, Emily's on it.
[01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:02.540]   Did you see it?
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:03.540]   Yeah, it was really hard to see.
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:04.540]   We had to like...
[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:06.540]   Like there was like one showing at one theater.
[01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:07.540]   Yeah, it's funny to go on one.
[01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:08.540]   We had to cut it down.
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:09.540]   But it's going into mass release.
[01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:10.540]   I think there's some kind of...
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:11.540]   You can play this.
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:12.540]   The trailer is good.
[01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:13.540]   You can play the trailer for a minute.
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:14.540]   It's good.
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:15.540]   Good.
[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:16.540]   Really?
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:18.540]   Like the trailer has too many of the jokes from the movie, but it's good.
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:19.540]   I hate that when they do that.
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:20.540]   But it's a good person.
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:21.540]   It's very disappointing when you see it.
[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:23.540]   That's like every Disney movie ever.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:24.540]   Oh, I love it.
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:25.540]   It sees the story.
[01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:26.540]   Is it?
[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:27.540]   It's fun.
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:31.540]   It's going to go all over.
[01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:35.540]   Your travel will be ready soon as you put on his path.
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:36.540]   That was funny.
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:37.540]   Oh no.
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:38.540]   He's her driver.
[01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:39.540]   You're dating this girl.
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:40.540]   No.
[01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:41.540]   A white girl?
[01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:42.540]   It's okay.
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:43.540]   We hate terrorists.
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:50.540]   Can you imagine a world in which we end up together?
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:51.540]   I don't know.
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:52.540]   I don't know.
[01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:53.540]   Oh, this is good.
[01:58:53.540 --> 01:58:54.540]   I'm going to stop now.
[01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:55.540]   No, she was...
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:56.540]   She's not now.
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:57.540]   Now we get the plot, right?
[01:58:57.540 --> 01:58:58.540]   There we go.
[01:58:58.540 --> 01:58:59.540]   You get the plot.
[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:00.540]   You get the plot.
[01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:02.540]   You do, but you don't, but you don't.
[01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:03.540]   But it's good.
[01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:05.540]   Brown guy, white girl.
[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:10.540]   Can they just find love in this modern world when he can't get on a plane?
[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:11.540]   No, it's much more nuanced.
[01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:14.540]   If she gets harassed by adventure capitalists.
[01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:15.540]   No.
[01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:16.540]   No.
[01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:17.540]   I'm just trying to make it timely and topical.
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:23.540]   It's just a really nice romantic comedy with twists and things that you don't normally get.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:26.540]   Clearly from the title, something bad happens to her.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:28.540]   Yes, she's going to get sick.
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:30.540]   It's not giving it away.
[01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:34.540]   Every article has talked about her medically induced coma.
[01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:40.540]   I like Ryan O'Neill, but I haven't seen Ellie McGronham movie in years, so I'm glad that
[01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:42.540]   they brought that love story back.
[01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:43.540]   Oh yeah.
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:47.540]   Oh yeah.
[01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:50.540]   The guy who wrote love story, Eric, was Eric Siegel?
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:51.540]   Here we go.
[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:52.540]   Here we go.
[01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:59.540]   Eric Siegel was a very cynical fella and said before he wrote it, I'm going to, I'm going
[01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:02.540]   to formulently write a best-selling novel.
[02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:05.540]   Well done, sir.
[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:07.540]   Well done.
[02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:08.540]   Well done.
[02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:16.540]   When wealthy Harvard University law student Oliver Barrett IV, not Brown, meets Jenny Cavalieri,
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:17.540]   Ellie McGraw.
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:18.540]   I'm thinking this song down.
[02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:19.540]   I'm going to be all sad.
[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:21.540]   I can't even look.
[02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:23.540]   No, it's pretty bad.
[02:00:23.540 --> 02:00:24.540]   I'll tell the memories.
[02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:26.540]   You know, I could read the 70s.
[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:27.540]   Oh no.
[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:29.540]   The story of love.
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:33.540]   Why, you should bring up the point in the plastic bubble already.
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:34.540]   No, no.
[02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:39.540]   Oh no, no.
[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:40.540]   Stop it.
[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:42.540]   Oh no, Neil.
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:47.540]   The worst actor in the history of the world.
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:51.540]   Not that Ellie McGraw is so expressive.
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:54.540]   This past his classical music in America for a decade.
[02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:55.540]   Yep.
[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:56.540]   Yep.
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:57.540]   I definitely had to have, and there was the other one.
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:00:59.540]   What was the one we were playing?
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:02.540]   The other one with its album.
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:04.540]   Burning bed, Ferifosset.
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:06.540]   Oh no, sunshine on my shoulders.
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:08.540]   It was all like, you know, come on.
[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:09.540]   John Denver.
[02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:10.540]   You know, the other one.
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:14.540]   It was like the TV movie, and it was all like, oh, and then everybody was dying in the 70s.
[02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:17.540]   Well, thanks to the big sick that's coming back.
[02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:18.540]   Get ready.
[02:01:18.540 --> 02:01:20.540]   You know what it indicates?
[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:23.540]   It indicates a, it's like the sick joke cycle.
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:28.540]   There's a guy in Berkeley, Alan Dundas, who's an expert, a sociologist expert on this.
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:34.300]   Sick jokes always reflect the deep malaise we feel in a society about a big topic.
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:38.380]   So there were dead baby jokes when the abortion debate was at its peak.
[02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:44.140]   There were elephant and the refrigerator jokes when we were dealing with racial bias.
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:49.540]   And then people get sick because we're dealing with a Republican controlled conference.
[02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:50.540]   I don't know.
[02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:53.180]   Anyway, you know, it breaks down after a while.
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:54.540]   Okay, I'm going to move on.
[02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:55.540]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:02:04.540]   You freaking liberals, you're making me nuts.
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:08.220]   Do you have that to do?
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:11.540]   I do, but I don't really want to put it right up against that.
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:17.540]   I was like, I can give you another pick, but just distract us briefly.
[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:19.540]   You've got some Android things here.
[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:20.540]   Here's a deal alert.
[02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:25.540]   There you go.
[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:32.540]   This deal alert just come in a single Google Wi-Fi, just 99, 99 Amazon, $30 off.
[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:37.540]   I don't know why you'd want one of those, but you could get it.
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:41.540]   Deal alert.
[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:43.540]   What was the disease of the week last week?
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:45.540]   Oh, you brought us back there.
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:47.540]   Why are you doing that?
[02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:49.540]   Why would you do that?
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:51.540]   You're all cuted up for the end.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:53.540]   A little more classical music.
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:55.540]   A little more, just Google Aloe again.
[02:02:55.540 --> 02:03:02.540]   You know, you're going to send it on a high note.
[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:03.540]   Okay.
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:06.540]   This is when trailers didn't actually have to have anything but still.
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:11.540]   I don't think that was a thing.
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:13.540]   Google spared one point.
[02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:16.540]   I'm just checking Wikipedia for sad movies of the 1970s.
[02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:18.540]   I'm going to see if they have a cat.
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:20.540]   I'm going to see if they were.
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:22.540]   Oh, no, that's terrible.
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:23.540]   Okay, guys.
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:24.540]   I've just watched that.
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:25.540]   I'm sorry.
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:26.540]   I'm going to spoil her.
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:27.540]   She watched it.
[02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:28.540]   She gets the end.
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:29.540]   She goes, I can't believe it ended that way.
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:30.540]   Yeah.
[02:03:30.540 --> 02:03:31.540]   He walks off.
[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:35.540]   It's, I was like, I was like, the movie's called the way we were, not the way we are.
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:36.540]   The way we are.
[02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:37.540]   It's like right there.
[02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:41.540]   Everybody's saying that Brian's song is the one you're trying to remember, Danny.
[02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:42.540]   Is that right?
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:43.540]   Brian's song.
[02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:44.540]   Yeah.
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:45.540]   Well, Brian's song too.
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:47.540]   But no, no, it was like another woman who died.
[02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:48.540]   I'm going to see if I can get her off.
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:55.540]   Google has a victory in French court.
[02:03:55.540 --> 02:04:00.540]   Google has spared a $1.3 billion tax bill because they don't.
[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:04.540]   Google Ireland does not have to have a permanent establishment in France.
[02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:07.540]   That's going to be handy to pay off the EU fine.
[02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.540]   France, I try to get some, get some part of the way there.
[02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:11.540]   Yeah.
[02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:15.540]   Google did not illegally dodge French taxes by routing sales in the country out of Ireland,
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:18.540]   according to a Paris administrative court today.
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:22.540]   And why is Bloomberg hyphenating search engine?
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:23.540]   Oh my God.
[02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:24.540]   What is going on?
[02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:25.540]   Well, does it?
[02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:26.540]   Danny, we need you back.
[02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:29.540]   We need you back because Danny, no Danny, this is right.
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:33.540]   Danny, two nouns that modify a third noun are hyphenated.
[02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:34.540]   Oh, yes.
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:35.540]   Yes.
[02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:36.540]   That is not the way.
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:37.540]   That is proper.
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:38.540]   That is proper.
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:41.540]   So then if they say search engines, that's the way they are.
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:45.540]   It says, that is proper.
[02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:47.540]   So then if they say search engines.
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:51.540]   If it said cell, space, phone, giant, would they have hyphenated the cell?
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:52.540]   Yeah.
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:55.540]   What if they said, what if they said giant search engine?
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:05:00.540]   If you said high school player, you're not going to be high school player.
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:01.540]   You're not going to be high school player.
[02:05:01.540 --> 02:05:02.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:03.540]   You're going to be high school.
[02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:04.540]   You're going to be high school.
[02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:05.540]   You're going to be high school.
[02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:06.540]   You're going to be high school.
[02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:07.540]   You're going to be high school.
[02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:08.540]   You're going to be high school.
[02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:09.540]   You're going to be high school.
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:10.540]   You're going to be high school.
[02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:11.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:11.540 --> 02:05:12.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:12.540 --> 02:05:13.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:14.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:15.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:16.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:17.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:18.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:19.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:20.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:21.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:22.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:23.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:24.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:25.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:26.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:26.540 --> 02:05:27.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:28.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:29.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:30.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:31.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:32.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:33.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:34.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:35.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:36.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:37.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:38.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:39.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:40.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:41.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:42.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:43.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:44.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:45.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:46.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:47.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:48.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:49.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:50.540]   You're going to be high school player.
[02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:54.540]   Kaptera is a very, very important thing for everybody to know about.
[02:05:54.540 --> 02:06:00.540]   I'll tell you why, because how many times have you said, "What's the best?"
[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:01.540]   I don't know.
[02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:02.540]   What's your business?
[02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:04.540]   Medical office management software.
[02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:07.540]   What's the best website building software?
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:10.540]   What's the best learning management system?
[02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:13.540]   The best maintenance software, construction software, CRM software.
[02:06:13.540 --> 02:06:15.540]   Well, what do you do then?
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:17.540]   Do you go to Google and search CRM?
[02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:20.540]   That's designed and in disaster.
[02:06:20.540 --> 02:06:22.540]   This is such a better idea.
[02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:24.540]   I love it because it's free.
[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:26.540]   It's called Kaptera.
[02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:30.540]   400 categories of business applications.
[02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:36.540]   Everything from customer service to project management.
[02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:37.540]   You can narrow it down.
[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:40.540]   Let's say you're looking for, I like to do the medical practice.
[02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:43.540]   Let's say you're looking for software to manage your medical practice.
[02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:46.540]   There are so many of these.
[02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:49.540]   You could just go on and on and on.
[02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:51.540]   This is one way to start.
[02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:54.540]   They have short reviews, then links to the website.
[02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:55.540]   They have profiles.
[02:06:55.540 --> 02:06:57.540]   But you can also look on the right here.
[02:06:57.540 --> 02:07:01.540]   I can narrow it down and say, "I only want to see four-star or better reviews.
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:04.540]   I want to see something that can handle, let's say, 99-year-olds."
[02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:05.540]   That's pretty big.
[02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:07.540]   Let's say I have a small office, two to nine.
[02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:09.540]   Do you want it web-based or installed?
[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:10.540]   Do you need claims management?
[02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:11.540]   Yeah, I guess so.
[02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:13.540]   Of course, it has to be HIPAA compliant.
[02:07:13.540 --> 02:07:14.540]   Do we have more than one physician?
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:15.540]   Will we build patients?
[02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:17.540]   Now I'm going to filter the results.
[02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:20.540]   It's going to narrow it down to products that actually do that.
[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:24.540]   I'm going to say, "Let's compare this one and this one."
[02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:25.540]   You can't see it.
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:27.540]   It's under the lower third.
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:30.540]   Can you just briefly take down the lower third because I'm building this little bar down
[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:31.540]   here.
[02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:32.540]   See that?
[02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:33.540]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:35.540]   Then I press compare now.
[02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:40.540]   I get a chart of the three that I'm interested in, all the features, where, how they run.
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:48.540]   Then the best part is verified real user reviews, thousands of them, from people just like you.
[02:07:48.540 --> 02:07:50.040]   You can see screenshots.
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:52.540]   This is so useful.
[02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:53.540]   It's absolutely free.
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:54.540]   There's no obligation.
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:55.540]   You don't even need to register.
[02:07:55.540 --> 02:07:59.540]   You're not going to get annoying emails or follow-up phone calls.
[02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:00.540]   Nothing.
[02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:02.540]   It's just there for you for free.
[02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:04.040]   You won't spend weeks or months searching the internet.

[02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:49.060]   Are you there?
[02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:50.060]   He's muted.
[02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:53.060]   Or is it me?
[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:55.060]   Can you hear me now?
[02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:57.660]   Can you hear me now?
[02:08:57.660 --> 02:09:00.860]   Mr. Verizon, man, I can hear you.
[02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:01.860]   Wow.
[02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:02.860]   Come on.
[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:03.860]   Something.
[02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:04.860]   What's your favorite?
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:06.460]   Okay, you did a movie.
[02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:07.460]   So you actually technically...
[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:14.420]   No, I was going to do a tip for like if you haven't already used a wallet case.
[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:16.780]   That's a wallet case.
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:20.300]   It's a case where you have your cards and things.
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:23.420]   So you can slide your cards inside them like this.
[02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:26.020]   I'm trying to find cards that don't have numbers.
[02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:29.380]   For a cell phone case that has a wallet.
[02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:30.380]   Yeah.
[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:31.380]   And it's like...
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:32.380]   I hear you.
[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:34.180]   And I've got to say, I've not had...
[02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:35.180]   So this is my tip.
[02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:36.180]   It's not...
[02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:37.180]   No, it's not.
[02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:38.380]   It's not that thick at all.
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:40.860]   It's like that's that's that and it's a phone.
[02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:46.900]   I haven't carried a wallet for like almost three years now, maybe four, because you've
[02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:49.500]   got all my credit cards in there.
[02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:52.740]   I keep my emergency cash in the back.
[02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:55.420]   Or you can sometimes slide in a little bit there.
[02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:58.220]   And my one that I'm using for the iPhone is from Silk.
[02:09:58.220 --> 02:09:59.220]   You can find it on Amazon.
[02:09:59.220 --> 02:10:01.500]   It's actually a wire kind of recommendation.
[02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:04.340]   And I found it before Wirecutter recommended it.
[02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:07.140]   Because it's actually hard to find good wallet cases.
[02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:10.340]   They were kind of all the rage three or two years ago.
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:13.500]   And then it's like a spec stop making them.
[02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:14.500]   And...
[02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:15.500]   Oh, this is a...
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:16.500]   This is slim.
[02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:17.500]   On a box stop making them.
[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:18.500]   I get it.
[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:19.500]   Because this is fairly slim.
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:20.500]   It just got a little pouch in the back.
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:21.500]   And it...
[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:26.380]   I tell you what, it's a lot slimmer than trying to carry around a wallet and carry around.
[02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:27.380]   And they...
[02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:29.100]   It's not designed to carry everything you'd put in the wallet.
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:30.100]   Just a few cards and some...
[02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:35.660]   No, but what I found is you don't actually need this much as I used to carry, right?
[02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:37.500]   So you have a church because stands a wallet.
[02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:38.500]   My wallet is a...
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:41.180]   I know, but you tell you it's very liberating.
[02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:42.700]   You just have your phone.
[02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:44.500]   You've got a little bit of cash.
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:47.420]   And you've got your credit cards, your driver's license, things like that.
[02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:50.540]   How do you think you're trying to reach?
[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:51.540]   What happened?
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:53.980]   The Skype lady has interrupted us.
[02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:54.980]   What was that?
[02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:55.980]   Skype lady.
[02:10:55.980 --> 02:10:56.980]   Skype lady.
[02:10:56.980 --> 02:10:57.980]   That freaked me.
[02:10:57.980 --> 02:10:59.180]   I've never heard that before.
[02:10:59.180 --> 02:11:00.180]   You had it?
[02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:01.260]   So that's my tip.
[02:11:01.260 --> 02:11:04.620]   If you've never thought about it, wallet cases are pretty cool.
[02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:07.940]   They make me feel very, very free and very good.
[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:09.100]   And I've just...
[02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:12.940]   My main challenge is when the new phone comes out and making sure you can find one for them.
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:14.940]   And of course, there isn't one for the Pixel XL.
[02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:19.420]   At least when Google comes out with a Pixel, there is one for the Pixel XL.
[02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:20.420]   I can get you one.
[02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:21.420]   From still?
[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:22.420]   From...
[02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:24.060]   No, not for still, you have to find another one from Amazon.
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:25.060]   It's kind of sewn together.
[02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:26.060]   Yeah, I see a couple.
[02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:27.220]   It's like an Etsy project.
[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:28.220]   But, you know...
[02:11:28.220 --> 02:11:29.220]   It's from Etsy.
[02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:30.220]   It does.
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:31.220]   It does.
[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:32.220]   But it...
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:33.220]   For many nittiness.
[02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:34.820]   This is what kills me with Pixel.
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:38.360]   It's like, you know, Google phones, you're like, they're the ones I could never get wallet
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.360]   cases for.
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:40.360]   Yeah.
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:41.360]   All right.
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.360]   That's a good tip.
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:43.360]   All right.
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:44.360]   I tried.
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:45.360]   Yeah, that's excellent.
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:46.360]   Stacey Higg...
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:47.360]   Well, wait a minute.
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:48.360]   We've got to do a number.
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:49.360]   Then we'll do Stacey Higg and Botham.
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:50.360]   What's your number?
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:51.360]   I'm not sure.
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:52.360]   I'm not sure.
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:53.360]   I'm not sure.
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:54.360]   JJ.
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:55.360]   I think that.
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:56.360]   Well, you stole two of my numbers, but I found out.
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:57.360]   I stole another one from you.
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:02.220]   I bought a $100 million fund, a $100 million euro fund to suck up to publishers.
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:08.180]   Among the projects, the register is making fun of them for giving $800,000 to the UK Press
[02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:13.100]   Association to automatically write 30,000 articles a month.
[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:14.100]   30,000?
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:18.420]   The register says they're wasting their money and it's just trying to...
[02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:20.860]   It's a cynical move to get more pages and more ads.
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:21.860]   Wow.
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:26.000]   I think the Press Association says it's a way to get more content at no cost or low cost
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.760]   into publications.
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:32.040]   So are they real articles or are they chunked out?
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:33.040]   Yeah, the real articles.
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:37.240]   Yeah, the writers have been doing this for quite some time with sports and finance articles.
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:39.320]   So this is the way to try to get more local articles.
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:40.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.320]   Sports, a lot of the sports, because it's just, you know, it's...
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:43.320]   It's a structure data.
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:44.320]   It's a technical, yeah.
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:46.720]   As I like to say, an article is just a form of data visualization.
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:47.720]   Wow.
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:48.960]   Do you say that to your students?
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:49.960]   I say that all the time.
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:50.960]   I have t-shirts with that on there.
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:53.960]   Right after you say hyphenate the words before a noun.
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:57.120]   This could actually be cool because like...
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:12:58.600]   It's quite fine enough.
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:12:59.600]   Oh, sorry.
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:00.600]   That's nice.
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:04.960]   Yeah, I was going to say, like knowing what projects are permitted, like in your neighborhood,
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:06.640]   you could do like a Google search for...
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:14.840]   I mean, like, I know that I like to troll my little teacat and various other databases,
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:17.040]   looking for things that might relate to me.
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:19.000]   So I'm like, "Oh, this is kind of nice.
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.040]   I would like that delivered on the internet to me easily."
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:23.040]   Sweet.
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:26.360]   And Jimmy Wales' Wiki Tribune also got money?
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:27.360]   Oh, good.
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:29.560]   I know he got enough money to fund it, right?
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:34.720]   Yeah, and full disclosure is we gave him $50,000 and created a new market in $50,000
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:38.000]   from the news integrity initiative.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:39.000]   Good.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.240]   And he has his full complement of journalists.
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:42.640]   10 journalists, yep.
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:48.120]   And now he's looking for people to contribute.
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.600]   Volunteers to work well, side by side with them.
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:54.760]   Where can we go to find out more about that?
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:57.400]   Wiki Tribune.com.
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:13:59.720]   Have they actually created any content yet or is it still in there?
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:00.720]   Not really.
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:03.720]   I think Jimmy didn't interview somebody, but I know he helped.
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:04.720]   Yeah.
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:05.720]   Really?
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:06.720]   Stacey has been...
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:07.720]   Stacey has been...
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:08.720]   Stacey has been...
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:09.720]   Yes, that's a good way to start.
[02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:14.960]   Stacey has been working very hard to program her device, so it would work before her picks.
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:17.040]   And I gave you all the time in the world.
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:18.280]   Are you ready now?
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:20.240]   I'm ready, in fact.
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:21.240]   So I just...
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:23.880]   First, I had to find the phone, then I had to charge the phone.
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:25.680]   Your husband had to bring you the phone.
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:26.680]   Yes.
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:29.360]   So what I'm showing you guys is the Fobaro...
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:31.400]   Oh, I lost it.
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:32.400]   This is the box.
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:35.360]   The Fobaro HomeKit-enabled motion sensor.
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:38.280]   And everyone's like, "Ooh, I have Sauron.
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:42.320]   I am sad to report to you guys that there is not actually an I has Sauron."
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:44.520]   This is what it looks like when it's not getting anything.
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:46.360]   Oh, that's just the box.
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:47.360]   Woo-hoo!
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:48.360]   Sorry.
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:53.240]   Now it just looks like one of those scary cameras out of the circle movie.
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:56.200]   Yes, kind of an I was camera.
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:58.280]   Why does it have eyes in the pictures?
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:01.280]   Yeah, that's misrepresentation.
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:03.480]   They call it their cat's eye design.
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:04.480]   And it's this...
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:05.480]   Only you guys would love the eyes.
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:09.120]   Everybody else is going to get rid of the eyes.
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:12.040]   Can you imagine this in the corner of your closet?
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:15.560]   Like it's a motion sensor and you're like, "Oh my God, it's watching me."
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:16.920]   This is like scaring me.
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:17.920]   This ad is scaring me.
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:19.480]   I feel like they're about to attack us.
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:20.760]   What's happening?
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:21.760]   Is it floating?
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:23.320]   Oh no, it's tucked to the ceiling.
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:24.320]   It's motion.
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:25.320]   There's a back.
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:26.480]   Oh, so this is like what you get in stores.
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:27.480]   Oh, there is an I.
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:28.960]   Oh, it does flash an I.
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:30.760]   Well, it flashes.
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:34.240]   Mine doesn't look like an I when it flashes, but maybe my lighting is not appropriate.
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:35.400]   I'm trying to get it to flash.
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:39.000]   It's looking like an I or an O.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.440]   Yeah, I mean, it's a super fast flash though.
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:43.560]   So what is it sensing?
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:45.040]   It's sensing temperature.
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:46.880]   Hold on, I'll tell you.
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:50.760]   Motion and oh, that's the wrong phone.
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:52.680]   This is a noise and earthquake.
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:56.240]   People are being monitored if this thing.
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:16:00.440]   It detects even the slightest vibrations, but it doesn't tell you what the motion is.
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:01.440]   Oh my God.
[02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:02.440]   It's not a camera.
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:03.440]   It's not a camera.
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:04.440]   It's a motion sensor.
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:08.120]   So it's going to be doing, okay, temperature.
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:09.120]   Oh, in ambient.
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:10.120]   Wait a minute.
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:11.120]   It's a cloud.
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:13.120]   The cloud is going to be inside the house.
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:14.720]   Oh no, get out now.
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:15.720]   The cloud.
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:16.720]   The cloud detector.
[02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:19.640]   It's why I always needed.
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:21.560]   Why is it cat attacking this stuff?
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:22.560]   The animal.
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:24.040]   I don't like this house.
[02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:25.040]   Smummy.
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:26.040]   Cloud.
[02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:27.040]   The cloud.
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.040]   The kids go away.
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:30.040]   Run away from the cloud detector.
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.080]   I think it's a juggle out detector.
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:36.640]   If you just put scary music over this ad, it just.
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:38.680]   No, they put happy music.
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:39.680]   They put happy music.
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:40.680]   You're fun.
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:41.680]   Some scary music.
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:42.680]   Or Stacy.
[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:43.680]   Yeah.
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:44.680]   Go ahead.
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:45.680]   Some more.
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:49.440]   Okay, so it knows when you move the thing.
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:50.440]   So here it is.
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:51.440]   Good game.
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:52.440]   Oh, do you see it?
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:54.680]   Let's get the music on Carson.
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:55.680]   This is the cars.
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:57.040]   This is the music we're going to play.
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.000]   Get the, get my music.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000]   Your ad.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.000]   Stay out kids.
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.000]   Oh, I like that.
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:03.000]   Yeah.
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000]   What is happening?
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000]   Oh my God.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.000]   Oh my God.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:09.000]   Oh no, after the kids go to the store.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:16.440]   Oh no, after the kids go to the store.
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:22.680]   The eye of Sora from Mordor comes the best way to monitor your home and watches your
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:29.360]   children with no motion detected as they're all dead.
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:30.360]   Wow.
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:31.360]   Okay.
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:33.080]   There you go.
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:34.840]   So Stacy, do you like it?
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:35.840]   All right.
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:40.160]   I'm just thinking how far I was never going to send me anything ever again.
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:41.760]   Oh, this is a great plug.
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:42.760]   This is a great plug.
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:45.160]   People are going to be very curious about it now.
[02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:46.160]   It's all right.
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:47.160]   It's all right.
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:48.200]   Oh, oh, oh, do you see it going nuts?
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:49.200]   Yeah.
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:50.200]   Yeah.
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:51.200]   It's because I just moved it.
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:52.720]   It's like, oh, someone's tampering with your motion.
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:55.000]   Why would you want that instead of a camera?
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000]   I mean, my, my Nest IQ does all of that too, I think.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.960]   Oh, because it doesn't have a camera in it.
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:00.960]   That's the beauty of it.
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:01.960]   If you don't want it.
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:02.960]   You're right.
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:04.760]   Because my wife threw the Nest IQ out of the house.
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:05.760]   Right.
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:08.720]   So there it is warning me that it's detected tampering.
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:09.720]   Okay.
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:16.480]   So I set up my motion detectors to turn on lights when like my, a good example is in my laundry
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:17.480]   room.
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:19.720]   My laundry room, when I open the door, it turns on the lights.
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:22.720]   When I close the door after no motion, it turns off the lights.
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:24.560]   This is like a refrigerator.
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:26.200]   Yes.
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:31.680]   Or if you've got closets, you can put smart light bulbs so that it in, then you tie them
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:36.080]   into your motion sensor and then you have fancy closets that light up when you open
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:37.080]   the door.
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:38.080]   Oh, okay.
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:40.640]   And you can also do it for home security.
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:47.080]   You can set it like arm the system and then if motions detected, you know, send an alert,
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:49.440]   sound a siren, do something.
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:51.320]   So this one is special.
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:52.840]   Fobaro's made these for a long time.
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:57.320]   They're, well, they're actually one of my two favorite sensor companies and tech is the
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:58.760]   other one.
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:03.560]   And this, this particular sensor is home kit enabled.
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:06.200]   This is their first home kit lineup.
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:08.040]   Oh, yes.
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:14.000]   So I, I'm like, I'm not that keen on home kit.
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.360]   How can an apples technology?
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:17.680]   That's apples technology.
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:24.760]   And then I also have the window, the open closed sensor, which goes somewhere around
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:25.760]   here.
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:26.760]   Yep.
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:27.760]   I can't make it work.
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:33.560]   And so this is, it's kind of like a whole, well, that's a whole kit.
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:34.560]   Yeah.
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:38.880]   And I didn't pair that one in case you guys wanted to see me pair a home kit device and
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:40.800]   see how easy it can be.
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:41.800]   Okay.
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:42.800]   I don't have to.
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:43.960]   What's the hub for the home kit?
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:44.960]   Is it the phone?
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:49.320]   It's your phone and or your Apple TV or your iPad.
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:56.960]   See, and I presume that apples, new home hub as they call it is going to be home pod is
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:00.600]   going to be the, really the home hub of the future.
[02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:02.040]   And the Apple TV works great.
[02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:06.360]   Like the way it interacts with my home kit enabled door locks.
[02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:12.840]   It's magical because every few months they actually will talk to each other and I can
[02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:13.840]   unlock things remotely.
[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:17.440]   But for most of the time, they just don't even deal with them each other.
[02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:25.440]   I saw somebody tweet that every time he joined some Wi-Fi that his locks thought he was
[02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:30.640]   home because I guess the Wi-Fi was centered somewhere near his house and his whole house
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:31.640]   would unlock.
[02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:32.640]   Oh, how funny.
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:34.400]   Like the coffee shop Wi-Fi.
[02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:36.800]   So that's not a good thing.
[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:42.920]   Anyway, anyway, anyway, so I'm not a huge fan of home kit.
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:44.320]   No one will accuse me of that.
[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:45.320]   Why not?
[02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:47.800]   One, I'm not an Apple.
[02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:49.320]   We're not an Apple only household.
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:50.320]   Right.
[02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:51.320]   And so that's a big thing.
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:55.520]   But I also hate how this is a general pet peeve of mine.
[02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:58.440]   Instead of things being tied to a household, they're tied to your personal account and
[02:20:58.440 --> 02:21:00.040]   then you have to share everything in iCloud.
[02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:05.160]   So my husband owns the iPad that we wanted to use, whereas I own my iPhone and it is possible
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:07.840]   to link the two, but it's such a pain in the butt.
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:18.080]   So I am a big fan of like, I guess devices, multi-device, sorry, support for multiple people
[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:22.600]   in a home in a way that's really easy and no one's figured that out.
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:23.600]   It's not just home kit.
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:26.200]   All those words are separated by a dash, by the way.
[02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:27.200]   All of them.
[02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:28.600]   They were all descriptions.
[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:32.160]   So yes, so that's the fobara.
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:34.600]   I haven't played with it beyond setting it up.
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:39.240]   So if you guys, I can, in a couple of weeks, I could be like, this is what I know.
[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:40.240]   This is good.
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:42.160]   This is bad.
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:45.400]   Is it F-U-B-A-R-O?
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:50.280]   They're not from around here, are they?
[02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:52.120]   They are European.
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:53.640]   I think they might be Italian.
[02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:57.840]   Because they don't know what Fubar means in America.
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:21:58.840]   And I will say they're app.
[02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:01.840]   I went on their app and I was like, is that really them?
[02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:02.840]   Wait a minute.
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:03.840]   It looks a little sketchy.
[02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:04.840]   Wait a minute.
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:07.480]   Okay, you bought the eye, but I'm buying the button.
[02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:10.320]   Oh, the button is awesome.
[02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:12.240]   So they don't have a home kit button though.
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:16.080]   So this is their Z-Wave stuff and their Z-Wave stuff is immaculate.
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:17.080]   It's awesome.
[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:19.960]   So you just push the button and then you tell it what to do.
[02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:24.960]   It's like the Logitech pop, except it's cooler looking because it's Italian.
[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:26.600]   Oh, it's Italian.
[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:27.600]   It sure is.
[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:28.600]   Look at that.
[02:22:28.600 --> 02:22:29.600]   Fubar.
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:32.600]   It means something different in Italian.
[02:22:32.600 --> 02:22:36.640]   Ooh, you can hide it and then eject some from your office.
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:37.640]   I like that.
[02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:39.200]   Oh my God, it was like totally fail.
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:41.040]   You'd be like, I'll relieve you this button.
[02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:45.480]   If you're not well, it just puts the button in the Wi-Fi, I'll be down.
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:48.400]   He'll be like, oh, help.
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:52.560]   Oh, one click turns on light, two clicks turns on the projector, three clicks turns on the
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:53.560]   fan.
[02:22:53.560 --> 02:22:54.560]   Well, it's crazy.
[02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:55.560]   Or click, how it's Danny.
[02:22:55.560 --> 02:22:58.880]   I'm just going to get twice if it's an emergency.
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:00.120]   Why is 911 a call?
[02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:03.480]   So this is like a dash button that does anything you want.
[02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:04.480]   Right.
[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:09.720]   That's tied to a Z-Wave hub or whatever.
[02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:15.440]   And yes, yes, this person is talking about email addresses for your home as a way to
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:16.840]   manage all this drama.
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:21.520]   And I don't want to do that, but I've already had to do it.
[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:22.520]   All right.
[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:24.520]   I need a button.
[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:25.520]   Stay safe.
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:28.040]   I need a button and it needs to punch Leo.
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:29.040]   That's it.
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:34.840]   If you had that button, we just need an IOT boxing glove.
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:35.840]   That's what we need.
[02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:37.480]   Really, I have buttons, Leo.
[02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:38.480]   I have all kinds of--
[02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:39.480]   You got the button.
[02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:41.240]   You just need to get the glove.
[02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:42.240]   Yeah.
[02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:46.560]   I think if we just keep mentioning this, somebody will just make it for the satisfaction of--
[02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:47.560]   Like so.
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:53.000]   Danny, you could put Stacy's screen on a motorized bottom and she could just jam you.
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:57.880]   She just wants a button that she hits and then a boxing glove comes out and punches
[02:23:57.880 --> 02:23:58.880]   me.
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:03.640]   Or we could do one of those-- actually, why don't we do this, Leo, the telepresence robots
[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:05.240]   and then I could just roll over your foot.
[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:06.240]   I have one here.
[02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:07.240]   Well, we don't use.
[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:10.920]   I spent so much money on that thing, we used it like three times and I was like, well,
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:11.920]   this is dopey.
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:19.200]   And then now I don't fit any of the current iPads because it was tied to that model.
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:20.200]   Oh.
[02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:21.200]   Sorry.
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:25.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think we should wrap this thing up because I see Megan Moroni and
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:30.440]   Jason Hall with her noses pressed to the glass trying to get in so they can do TNT.
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:32.840]   Thank you, Danny Sullivan, for coming out of retirement for the show.
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:33.840]   Hey, Danny.
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:34.840]   Great to see you.
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:35.840]   Thank you very much for having me.
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:40.480]   It's the Frank Sinatra disappeared at the last time I'm trying to fix it, but I've given
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:41.480]   up.
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:42.480]   I have to reboot the computer.
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:43.480]   Come back.
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:45.200]   Come back anytime.
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:48.720]   We will contact you and we'll just-- you have an open invitation.
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:50.320]   Crayo, I appreciate it.
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:51.320]   It's always fun to be here.
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:52.320]   Nice to have you.
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:53.320]   Really appreciate it.
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:56.840]   Stacy Higginbotham, you'll find her at stacianiot.com.
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:58.520]   That's where her newsletter is.
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:05.600]   And don't forget she and Kevin Tofe, the great Kevin Tofe, host the IOT podcast.
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:07.600]   Oh, it's the Stacy podcast.
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:08.600]   That's how everyone knows it.
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:09.600]   It's Stacy.
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:10.600]   And that guy--
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:11.600]   Oh, no.
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:13.720]   Kevin, Kevin gets full.
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:16.120]   He's my total co-host, great partner.
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:17.120]   Nice.
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:18.120]   Oh, I love Kevin.
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:21.920]   And tell him now that he's not at the goog, we got a chance for him.
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:22.920]   He is ours.
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:23.920]   Yep.
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:24.920]   We want him in here.
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:25.920]   Forget what I told that Sullivan guy.
[02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:26.920]   Oh, he's still here.
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:27.920]   I'm on mute.
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:28.920]   I'm on mute.
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:33.320]   I love how he talks about his lips moving.
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:34.320]   It's amazing.
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:39.200]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at CUNY.
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:40.440]   He knows where to put the dashes.
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:42.360]   He knows where the dashes are hidden.
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:44.160]   That's indeed exactly right.
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:46.280]   And you can find more of his work at buzzmachine.com.
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:48.080]   That's his blog or also on Medium.
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:50.000]   But he writes prolific--
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.960]   My hair has gone all Joe Scarborough.
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:52.960]   I like it.
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:53.960]   I like it.
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:57.760]   And I think for parody, you should join the Republican Party just to make it.
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:25:59.760]   Just to balance it out.
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:03.320]   Jeff, Jeff, are you going to go anywhere?
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:04.680]   Are you home for a while?
[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:07.640]   No, I'm going to Lima tomorrow for two days.
[02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:08.640]   Oh, wow.
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:09.640]   That's a long flight.
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:10.640]   Then I'm back.
[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:11.640]   And then I'm in Sydney.
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:15.120]   So I'll be calling you in two weeks, six to three in the morning.
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:16.120]   Yikes.
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:17.120]   My time.
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:18.120]   But it's worth it.
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:19.120]   Last time I did that for Sydney.
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:20.120]   That is dedication.
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:23.480]   Last time I did for Sydney, the hotel had no Wi-Fi.
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:27.440]   So I went and bought a then, I guess, 3G box.
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:32.680]   And I was out on the water doing the show with the bridge in the background and the
[02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:33.680]   sunrise.
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:35.080]   I remember that.
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:36.240]   That was so gorgeous.
[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:37.240]   Yeah.
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:38.240]   Well, it was good.
[02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:39.240]   Yeah.
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:40.240]   Maybe we can do that.
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:41.240]   We create that.
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:42.240]   We do this.
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:47.680]   We can Google Wednesdays 130 Pacific 430 Eastern 2030 UTC if you want to stop by and join us.
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:52.520]   You can watch it live on our website, Twitter TV slash live, but you can also watch it on
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:57.120]   YouTube and Twitch and you stream and you can be in the chat room at irc.twit.tv so
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:00.440]   you can talk back to the television.
[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:04.840]   I'm talking to the television.
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:12.160]   If you can't be here live, please by all means subscribe on your favorite podcast application
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:14.840]   or visit Twitter TV slash twig.

[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:19.640]   Always a lot of fun.

[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:30.040]   call your member of congress and to comment at the FCC and fight for net neutrality.
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:32.640]   This is the battle for the future of the internet.
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:33.640]   We'd appreciate that.
[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:36.800]   Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next time on twig.
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:39.380]   (upbeat music)
