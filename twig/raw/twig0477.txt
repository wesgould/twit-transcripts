[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, of course, lots of big Google announcements.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.480]   And we've got the experts to talk about it.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.320]   Kevin Tofel will talk about the new Chromebook slate.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.640]   Stacey Higginbotham about the new Google Home Hub.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.040]   And Jeff Jarvis is in studio.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.640]   He's got to decide.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.640]   Pixel 3?
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.280]   No, Pixel 3.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.640]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.640]   That casts you love from people you trust.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.640]   This is Twig.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.640]   This is Twig.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.920]   This week in Google, episode 477, recorded Wednesday, October 10, 2018.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.720]   Roadie-matic.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.740]   This week in Google is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage by Quick and Loans, introducing
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.180]   Raychild Approval, if you're in the market to buy a home, Raychild Approval locks up
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.380]   your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.140]   It's a real game changer.

[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.580]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show where we talked about the latest from
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.700]   Google and the Googleverse.
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.220]   Lo and behold, he has appeared in person, in the flesh.
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.220]   Could he do that?
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.020]   Could he poke me if he weren't here?
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.180]   Stacey, he's going to be your automaton.
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.180]   Puncher by proxy.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.180]   Excellent.
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.100]   I need a proxy puncher.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.140]   Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com, professor of journalism.
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.100]   We'll find out why he's here in just a bit.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.820]   Also, Stacey Hickenbotham, but Stacey's at the airport.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.740]   Yes, sorry for the glow in the weird sounds.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.980]   You sound great.
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.980]   Which airport are you at and why?
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.460]   I'm at SeaTac.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.740]   This week was at something called the Smart Kitchen Summit.
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.900]   Are you also house hunting?
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.340]   I was not house hunting yet.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.140]   No, I was just at the Smart Kitchen Summit doing robots in the kitchen, screens in the
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.820]   kitchen, so many things in the kitchen.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.740]   I bought something in the kitchen I want to show you.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.460]   I thought, finally, I'll have something Stacey doesn't have.
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.460]   But I don't have it yet.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.460]   But I'll show it to you.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.460]   What is it?
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.060]   I'll tell you in a second, but first let's introduce Kevin Tofold.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.140]   He's also here, Stacey's co-host on the IoT podcast, but also the Mater D at about Chromebooks
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.140]   .com.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.140]   I'm everything about Chromebooks .com.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.980]   I'm the Mater G, the waiter, the busboy, you name it.
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.180]   Chief Cook and bottle washer, we used to say, as we used to say.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.780]   And of course, it's great to have Kevin here because he was at the Google event.
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.780]   You weren't doing it.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.780]   I was not.
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.780]   I was jealous as hell.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.980]   If I were in New York, I would have been there.
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.980]   But I wasn't.
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.980]   I was here.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.980]   Why aren't you here?
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.980]   Hold on.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.260]   Oh, we didn't ask yet.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.260]   Why are you here?
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.420]   I'm not allowed to say.
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.180]   First next week, I'll make some announcements on stuff, but I'm working on things.
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.180]   Okay.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.180]   Okay.
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.180]   I don't know.
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.780]   It's not a huge deal.
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.780]   It's just work.
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.780]   It's work.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.420]   It's his job.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.140]   And he does it well.
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.420]   So Google had an event.
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.500]   I thought, given all the leaks, that there would be nothing to say and there wasn't.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   There wasn't, right?
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.540]   I love the way they started it.
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.100]   They just went ahead and admitted it.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.300]   They played a video of, are we having the video?
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.300]   YouTube.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.300]   No, not that one.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.300]   They are finally.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.300]   Not that one.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.300]   Let me get you the video.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.300]   I have it in my Twitter.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.400]   And this is the.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.400]   Not that video.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.100]   This is why they were asking YouTubers for any video content.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.900]   They, you know, the right thing is this.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.900]   Did they ask for it?
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.540]   Yours I as a guitar?
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.540]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.100]   We had a pretty good idea they were going to do this.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.380]   So we have a very clear image now of this pixel three.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.900]   Go pretty much everything about it.
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:04:01.100]   No matter how hard you try, you literally can't get anything past the internet.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.460]   And so, so, and then they tweeted, tune in tomorrow.
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.660]   See for yourself.
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.100]   And I thought that meant, oh, because there was a theory that they were punking everybody.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.060]   I thought that meant, oh, this is hysterical.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.660]   None of it's true.
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.860]   No, it was all the same.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.860]   So you do it.
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.860]   So there was nothing.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.540]   They were poking fun at themselves.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.860]   And we know for pretty well, I thought from, you know, they get a good laugh out of it.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.260]   The only thing that you could say that was differing from all the leaks was there were
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.220]   no new Pixel Buds.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.780]   There was no Pixel Book 2.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.140]   No watch that we do that.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.340]   No, we knew there would be no watch.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.340]   They already said that.
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.900]   So there were some things that we that maybe they were going to announce they didn't.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.460]   But basically that's the pixel three, pixel three XL.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.940]   They announced the pixel, but actually you nailed the name.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.940]   What do they call it?
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.940]   The pixel slate.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.940]   Pixel slate.
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.260]   Kevin got that right.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.660]   They announced even the wireless charging stand that we thought they would.
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.660]   Right.
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.500]   And a seven inch Google home hub, which is a little thing surprised me there is that
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.660]   it's only seven inches.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.020]   They didn't do a seven and a 10 like other companies have done.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.740]   I'm just really small.
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.140]   Kevin has some insights about that.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.140]   Okay.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.140]   For every one of these events back in the day, back in the good old days, we do a race to
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.900]   see who gets in the order first, right?
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.780]   I ordered before the event was over.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.780]   I haven't.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.260]   I ordered the Pixel three XL.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.380]   I was very impressed.
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.140]   But you know who has I think everything because he brought it home from the event.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.140]   Kevin Tofel.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.100]   Did you did you get everything Kevin?
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.660]   No, I didn't get everything.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.860]   I got a Pixel three XL.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.860]   Whoa.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.860]   There it is.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.860]   Let's see the notch.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.860]   Can't even see the notch.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.900]   Well, yeah, that's because that's because it's an iPhone.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.900]   Hang on.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.500]   That has a notch too, by the way.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.660]   There is the notch.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.620]   That's not that big.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.940]   That's a that's obnoxious.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.940]   It's awful.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.060]   It's it's double the height.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.100]   It brings the status bar almost like double the height.
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.780]   And that's what people are going off about.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.900]   And I get it.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.260]   It's not ideal.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.500]   But you know, I don't think it's terrible.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:17.020]   799 for a 64 gig version, 100 bucks more for a double the memory 128 gig storage version
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.140]   for the XL and 100 bucks less in each category for the smaller.
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.140]   799 or 899.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.140]   Was it 799?
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.140]   Oh, that's what it was.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.140]   799 for the Pixel three, 899 for the XL.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.900]   899 for the top.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.460]   I end up spending 999.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.500]   Of course you did.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.500]   I am not going to buy.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.060]   You know, I've been a Pixel or a Google hardware person forever.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.180]   That's too much money.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.940]   And I would get the smaller version because, you know, tiny hands and pockets and all
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.940]   that nonsense.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.940]   But.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.260]   And there's no notch in the smaller version, right, Kevin?
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.260]   Correct.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.700]   It's just a small chin and forehead.
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.900]   So chin and forehead?
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.900]   That's what we call it.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.900]   That's what we call it.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.620]   Like the old Pixel two X.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.620]   Right.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.620]   A top and bottom bezel.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.620]   There's a chin.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.620]   What the kids used to say.
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.620]   And a and a forehead.
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.620]   No, it's a chin.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.620]   A forehead.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.620]   No.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.620]   That's new.
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.980]   Which everybody wonders because the new XL has a chin, but no forehead.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.140]   Instead, it's like my first girlfriend.
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.060]   It's a lobotomy.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.060]   So.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.900]   Or a forehead.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.900]   I'm sorry, Kathy.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.820]   That was not a good thing to say.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.700]   You had a little bit of a forehead.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.740]   But she didn't have a notch.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.740]   I can.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.740]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.740]   So why?
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.740]   It's easy.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.220]   I'm doing it for you now.
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.220]   Thank you.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.700]   Did you see me just open my mouth and horror there?
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.460]   I'm like, oh, it's a show.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.220]   It's a show.
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.220]   It's a show.
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.220]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:50.860]   So I'm going to come in a year to Kevin and be like, yo, Kevin, give me a cheap phone.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.380]   Or give me a good recommendation for, because with Android, what is Google called the now
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.020]   everyone gets Android at the same time kind of effort?
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.020]   Android one.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.020]   Android one.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.020]   I was going to say Android first.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.260]   And Treble makes that possible.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.260]   Treble.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.260]   Treble.
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.260]   So.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.540]   I still wouldn't get a Google phone.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.500]   I don't trust anybody else.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.500]   Why did you or what?
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.260]   What I have a note on the other room.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.300]   And I don't trust Samsung with it.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.620]   So what you said before was over you ordered or what are pressed to you?
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.980]   Well, I think the camera.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.820]   And I'm sure Kevin will have something to say about that.
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.820]   But it's.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.260]   And so far, I've heard from and seen it from a number of people who were at the event and
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.580]   handled it, that it's everything that last years was not that the screen this time is
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.100]   very good, that the feel in the hand is very good.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.420]   I like it that it has wireless charging because every other phone I use has wireless charging.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.980]   That's a real convenience for me.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.700]   I bought the stand just to try it because it sounded like it had special features.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.740]   It somehow recognized.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.700]   Actually, that's another question which is yet unanswered.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:58.020]   Does it automatically turn on the screen saver, the daydream photo album and the larger clock
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.660]   if it's not on its pixel stand?
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.860]   Are we going to see an unboxing now?
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.860]   We could do that.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.220]   I haven't opened it yet only because I have a wireless charger already.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.220]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.860]   And those special features either are not enabled yet on the review model because there are
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.940]   a few software bits not here yet.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.060]   Or it's smart enough to know, hey, this isn't a pixel stand.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.660]   I'm not going to do the special stuff.
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.900]   But you're right that that when on that stand, it kind of turns the phone into a limited mini
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.420]   Google Home Hub in a sense because it can show you your photos.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.940]   It has your routine buttons for the Google Assistant.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:40.300]   And it'll even show your Nest Camera Doorbell or Doorbell Camera rather if somebody rings
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.300]   the doorbell.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.580]   Yeah, so that's kind of...
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.540]   So Kevin, would you buy it?
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.060]   You know, Jeff, I'm in a different position at this point because I'm kind of like trying
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.220]   to budget things for the first time in my life.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:10:02.700]   And I literally just bought two months ago a $325 Nokia 7 Plus which lasts for two days.
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.260]   It's speeding up for me.
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.900]   The camera's decent enough.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.140]   So given that, I'd probably say no.
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.860]   If I had the money to burn, yeah, I probably would just because the camera features alone
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.580]   have blown me away in the past just 24 hours.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.380]   It does highlight Google's problem though.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.100]   If people have enough money, they'll probably buy an iPhone because people who buy Android
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.700]   phones tend to be budget consumers.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.700]   I don't know about that.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.700]   I think so.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.940]   I think that's the real problem.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.140]   And if they're not budget consumers, they're probably buying Samsung.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.740]   We know that Google only sold 10 million Pixel 2s in a year.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.700]   Yeah, but...
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.340]   Go on, Kevin.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.780]   Well, I think you're partly right and partly wrong.
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.580]   And I say that because the difference is there really isn't many cheap iPhone options unless
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.500]   you want something that's two or three years old.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.900]   So if you're going to have iOS, you've got to pay X on the dollar.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.700]   Let's not say, if you've got a lot of money, you're going to get a life fund.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.700]   Sure.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.900]   Well, Samsung does sell a lot of galaxies.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:09.780]   It's not their biggest money maker in terms of overall volume times profit.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.820]   So that's why they have low and mid-range phones.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.980]   Problem number two for Google is if you've got a small...
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.780]   I think there's a smaller number of Android people who are willing to spend money if you've
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.780]   got...
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.780]   But those people are buying Samsungs.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.500]   So problem number two, at the very best, Google's dividing the high end of the Android
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.140]   market with Samsung at the best.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.140]   What's their business goal?
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.940]   Is it to be a highly profitable item or is it still to set the bar?
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.700]   Sure looked like watching the event looked like that they think they're a player.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.700]   They want to be a player.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.500]   It's not a reference product.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.940]   I would agree with that.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.860]   They must have some...
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.780]   And this probably comes into their CFO who's been there what two...
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.020]   At least two years now.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.540]   They probably have some hard targets on that hardware division now because things have
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.460]   changed ever since Ruth Poorot came on.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.500]   They want to make serious money out of that hardware division.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.460]   So I had my year old Pixel 2.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:05.060]   Oh, by the way, before I forget, do you still get the always on notification screen thing
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.060]   like this?
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.060]   Yes.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.060]   I love that.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.060]   I do love that.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.060]   I do love that a lot.
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.820]   So there's a year old phone.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.820]   It's perfectly good.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.660]   It's wonderful.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.540]   Kevin, your advice to me, not that I'm rich, I'm not, but is it worth...
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.580]   Is the camera a loan worth upgrading?
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.780]   Put it that way.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.500]   From what do you have now, Jeff?
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.500]   The Pixel 2.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.500]   You know, I don't have one of those anymore.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.980]   I have a first gen Pixel.
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.220]   Here's part of the question mark and maybe Kevin can help us with this.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.460]   Google wasn't completely clear about which of the camera features are migrating to the
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.940]   Pixel 2 and which are it?
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.940]   Ah, right.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.580]   Both of them are using that same chip, the image engine.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.380]   And it sounded like they in the announcement that some of these features, if not all of
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.220]   these features, are going to be available at least on the Pixel 2, if not other Android
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.220]   phones.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.220]   Yeah, I'm not...
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.140]   The night thing?
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.860]   I suspect the night sight is not going to be pushed down.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:01.860]   And that is just an opinion.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.540]   I don't have hard information on that.
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.260]   I also believe, and I've been trying to research this afternoon, I'm kind of coming up short,
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.860]   if they upgraded that visual core chip in this model.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.900]   I know they put the Titan security chip in here, but obviously, there's nothing to do
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.900]   with photos.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:21.460]   I seem to believe they have updated the visual core chip, in which case some things may not
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.420]   come all the way down the line.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:28.700]   This is a life hacker article on how to get some of the features or what features.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.860]   And this is the problem, is Google wasn't clear in the announcement?
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.620]   But what features will migrate down?
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.820]   No, I don't want that.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.820]   Thank you.
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.620]   According to Google, nights, here you go.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.380]   According to Google, night sight will be rolling out to previously released Pixel smartphones
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.340]   in the coming weeks.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.340]   Okay.
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.340]   Duplex.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:56.180]   Duplex is getting a full release on the Pixel 3 devices and will be coming to other Pixel
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.700]   phones in November.
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.180]   Remind us what Duplex is.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.780]   That's that assistant that talks to you.
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.980]   And adds us.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.660]   And so this is, so they, was that your imitation of a computer?
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:14.300]   No, no, that was just, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.900]   the call screening, which I think everybody in the room, Kevin enjoyed a lot, the idea
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:26.340]   that the call screening driven by Google Assistant on phone call screening will also be on all
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.860]   Pixel phones.
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.260]   I think they stole that.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.620]   They stole it from them, from themselves with Google voice.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.820]   Ah, yes, Google voice does that.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:40.100]   But, but Google voice, it's not quite the same because with Google voice, you have to
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.660]   have a preset in the Google voice settings where you say, Hey, if they're not, like,
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:50.500]   as for instance, if they're not on my contact list screen or if they're an unknown caller
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:55.780]   screen, this one, as a call comes in, you can press a button that says screen that one.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.780]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.620]   In real time, Google voice does not do that.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.620]   That is awesome.
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.620]   Cool.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.260]   So, because I'm getting calls all the time from like Apple.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:10.100]   And I love just press instead of just hang up on them, screen it or something.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:16.780]   Um, playground and improved AR, uh, will launch first in the Pixel 3, but roll out to other
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.780]   Pixel phones.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.780]   All right.
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.780]   So I might be sticking with it.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.780]   I can't wait.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.780]   We're not there yet.
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.780]   I know.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.780]   I don't want to get ahead.
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.940]   But I'm, what I'm most looking forward to is Kevin's view of the Pixel book.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.940]   Okay.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.940]   We'll get there.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.940]   I know we're out there yet.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:34.340]   Is my, if I'm going to spend a thousand bucks or more, uh, where's it going to go?
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.340]   Let's uh, continue on with the phone.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.020]   Cause Kevin, you said something that I think intrigues everybody listening.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.700]   You were very excited about the camera.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.700]   Yes.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.460]   Um, so I've been playing with the camera.
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.380]   Again, it does not have the night site yet.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.980]   Um, it did just get the playground feature this morning.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.780]   So I was having Ironman run around my house.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.580]   Um, virtual AR type kind of thing.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:06.420]   Um, the front facing selfie mode, uh, portrait mode rather in selfie, I thought is amazing.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.420]   Absolutely amazing.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.500]   I don't know if we can share a picture that I took, but I took one in.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.540]   Uh, it's on the rundown.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.780]   I tried to share it through Google photos.
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.140]   Hopefully it is shareable or viewable, I should say.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.380]   All right.
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.900]   Where did you put it on the?
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.580]   It's a line 20.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.300]   Oh, line 20.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   Oh, self portrait.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.300]   Here it is.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.300]   I just got it.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.300]   Yep.
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.300]   Can you see it?
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.300]   I'm not sure.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.700]   So one of the things Marquez Brownlee did is took a picture of himself in his car and
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.740]   he said, sure isn't softened like the iPhone 10s.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.740]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.740]   Look at that.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.740]   Whoa.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.740]   Look at that detail.
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.740]   Wow.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.740]   Stumble.
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:47.740]   We can see we can count his stubble.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.780]   Now we're blowing this up a lot, but actually that looks and look at the, the bokeh.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.780]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.020]   That's good.
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.420]   This looks good.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.420]   This looks really good.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.420]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.220]   I'm very impressed with that.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.900]   The way the iPhone's doing it is actually kind of weird.
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.620]   It's softening a lot of it.
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.700]   It's over over processing it and a lot of people complain about that.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:13.420]   That's really the competition, of course, is a new iPhone 10s.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:17.820]   The iPhone is now doing what Google did last time with the Pixel 2, which is taking multiple
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.820]   images.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.500]   Did you say they don't yet have the best shot feature?
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.740]   Is that not there?
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.740]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.980]   So they have, you have to turn the motion on.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.340]   There's a setting in the phone to do that and you can turn the motion on, but it's not
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.540]   yet showing you which is the recommended photos, nor is it letting you choose a photo.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:42.540]   However, that picture I just took or just showed was actually at the Google because I
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.420]   went there after lunch to hang with some of my old teammates and I did see that feature
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.420]   and got to use it.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.420]   They're dog fooding it right now.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.700]   So it's probably going to show up like any day on the Pixel 3 XL.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.140]   It was very, very cool in the demo and then I got to use it and it worked really, really
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.140]   well.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.500]   We were being goofballs like Blinken and Sticking Our Tongues Out.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.140]   It was able still to capture a decent photo.
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.020]   This was actually my favorite moment in the event.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.700]   It's worth probably showing it again.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.020]   This is Google explaining why they did top shot.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.260]   Do you hear the audio?
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.260]   You don't hear the audio.
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.780]   Yeah, this was a great video.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:26.980]   So there are a lot of pictures of just the wrong moment.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.180]   Guys jump off the cliff but you don't get it.
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.980]   Lots of people with terrible faces.
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.460]   She's blown out the candles but they only get it afterwards.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.100]   The tie is in the face of the bride.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.380]   Guys, walking through the picture.
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.060]   Everybody has taken these pictures.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:48.540]   Where you just miss the shot.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:55.740]   I love this.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.740]   So what Google lets you do is, so this interest you have to have live picture turned on is
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.260]   go back.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:06.060]   It will make you recommend, based on, they said, AI recommended top shot but you could
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.500]   also choose from other ones.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.020]   It doesn't store every one of those.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:17.940]   I'm going to have to defer to Kevin because he's the only one who owns one.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.380]   It might come a week from tomorrow.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.380]   Yours too probably.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.380]   I have an order one.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.380]   Yes it will.
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.380]   You're the devil.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.380]   He's waiting for the to hear about the Pixelbook.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.380]   Let's wait.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.380]   Let's help him out.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:41.020]   I did not order this late.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.620]   So you said the top shot is not enabled.
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:49.580]   I wonder though, on the iPhone, if live photos turned on, it actually degrades the quality
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.580]   a little bit.
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.860]   The other images are not as good quality as the one you took.
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.820]   I'm sure Google's not doing it that way.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.380]   They have enough horsepower in this thing.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.460]   Especially with the image, a special dedicated image chip, that they could have full quality
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.020]   images, I hope.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.620]   But that's a problem with live photo.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.500]   I think it's a combination of, and something that Google I think is better at than Apple,
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:21.100]   it's a combination of a burst mode, camera type implementation as well as a processing
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:26.740]   software side and AI to kind of choose the best image for you.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.300]   Does it take the image?
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:33.820]   So it must start capturing the minute you go to the camera or the minute you raise the
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.860]   phone.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.620]   Certainly it starts capturing before you press the button because that's the problem.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.260]   Yeah, I don't know exactly when it starts to capture.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.980]   It might be always capturing and then just saving a few seconds before and after.
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.980]   I have no idea.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.460]   I await the privacy police.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.460]   No, this is...
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.620]   Well, it doesn't take it if your camera is not open presumably.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.780]   I think even the privacy police can't be...
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.820]   You just waited for seconds.
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.740]   Did you put childish Gambino in your... with Norm?
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.740]   Because that would have been cute.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.340]   I didn't do that yet.
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.340]   No.
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.340]   Not yet.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.340]   Not yet.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.060]   There's the augmented reality.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.220]   Again, we saw that.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.420]   This is not actually new.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.420]   Right.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.580]   Did they offer a compelling use case yet?
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.580]   For this?
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.580]   For augmented reality.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.580]   Serious.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.580]   Are we still...
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:31.460]   I actually see it in industrial IOT and some other things but no, I haven't seen anything
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.100]   for it to be on my actual phone.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.220]   So I was just curious.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.300]   Someone might come up with something, y'all.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.300]   It looks like...
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.300]   How long do you see...
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.300]   How long will you be in Seattle before you stop saying y'all?
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.540]   Oh, was it we're off?
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.300]   Oh, no, they love it in Seattle.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.300]   Oh, is that it?
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.300]   Look at y'all.
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.300]   Yeah, they just think that's so cute.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.300]   It is cute.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.940]   Here's an interesting point from the Google keyword blog, product blog.
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:59.660]   It does notice where you're taking a picture and then suggest an appropriate overlay.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:04.780]   This is like Snapchat light, kind of.
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:13.540]   So he's doing some gardening and it's suggested that she put a little green thumb.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:18.740]   So what that says, it knows the place and it kind of knows the activity.
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.940]   I expect more of this from Google because this is the kind of thing Google Photos is
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.940]   already doing.
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:28.020]   But it's contextual, it kind of understands what it's seeing.
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.460]   It's almost like bringing Google Lens and Google Assistant together into your compositions.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.460]   Right.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.460]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.460]   Right.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.100]   But again, you can't judge this stuff by demos, by blog posts, you've got to get the
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.100]   phone in.
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.100]   I'm going to wait till you get it.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.900]   Well, I won't have it next week, but I'll have it the week after.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.500]   I won't be getting it at all.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.180]   So Stacy, which one are you carrying now?
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.380]   I have the Pixel 2.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.380]   The 2.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.380]   Okay.
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.380]   It's fine.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.460]   I might agree.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.100]   I might be there too.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.980]   I might stick with that.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:04.540]   So I'm good with it until I drop it or do something horrible and then poof.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.540]   That's me.
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.540]   Okay.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.940]   Would you say Kevin, I should get the Nokia something something?
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.300]   The new Nokia 7.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:16.500]   It's kind of technically called the 7.1, but it's basically what I just bought, upgraded,
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.340]   slightly smaller and better screen.
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.900]   And unlike mine, which is an international version, it has the US ban support.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.500]   So that would work here and it's $350.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.820]   But I think your issue is going to be Verizon.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.820]   Oh.
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.260]   Or I don't know if I have the rises.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.820]   The Pixel will be available.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.500]   Pixel 3 will be available on Verizon.
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.260]   I want you to know.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.260]   We're going to get you the actual Pixel 3.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.500]   They gave us a Verizon SIM card with the test.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.500]   Follow the latest, Stacy.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.500]   Follow the light.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:48.260]   Or Stacy, you could spend $800 on the Heston cooking system.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.940]   Oh, did you get the Heston Q?
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.940]   I did.
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.380]   Oh, Leo, that's so crazy.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.900]   Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.180]   He says the woman who talked me into a $1,500 toaster oven.
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.820]   No, no, this is a good product.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.820]   You know what I mean.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.820]   This looks really cool.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.460]   It is like the BuzzFeed thing, but fancier.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:11.620]   It includes an inductive burner.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:17.300]   And then the pan has Bluetooth can talk to the burner plus it has a thermometer in it.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.620]   So it automatically knows what temperature it modifies the temperature according to a
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.900]   recipe.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.300]   You can actually look at the app and see the recipe.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.900]   So if you wanted to--
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.260]   So Tasty's is $149.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.860]   How much did you spend, Leo?
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.860]   Tasty has one?
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.020]   Yeah, tasty has one.
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.460]   They stopped making that one.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.460]   They did?
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.020]   I believe so, yes.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.020]   Do you have one?
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:47.140]   So this is-- no, I'm not a saute or a type-- I don't need help there.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.260]   I don't really need help there either, frankly.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.460]   This is not an area that is that complicated.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.620]   Well, so in this-- this is gets to some things we were talking about.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.380]   I went out to dinner with a bunch of tech and gadget reviewers from a bunch of different
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.260]   sites at this event.
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.580]   And we were like, recipes aren't written for this.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.580]   Like, you don't know if your pan is at 200 degrees.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.980]   You don't care if your pan is 200 degrees.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:09.980]   Right.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.300]   So-- so yes, but it is neat.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:17.580]   And actually GE is building that functionality into its new range tops range.
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.580]   Is it range yet?
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.580]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.580]   Yeah, I want to get an inductive--
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.580]   We love it.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.580]   --still top.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.580]   We love it.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.500]   Well, wait, because I saw with the wireless power consortium at this event what they were
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.780]   doing-- that I was at.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.260]   And I'll get you back to Google in a minute.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:36.660]   But they're standardizing on a higher voltage.
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.140]   It's not really high voltage.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:43.060]   But greater wattage inductive power that they put underneath the counter.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:48.060]   And then you could actually, with the right pan, cook directly on the countertop.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.860]   Otherwise, you'd have like a little coaster.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:51.860]   Oh, my God.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.860]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.620]   So you probably don't want to form like a countertop.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.620]   No.
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:01.300]   So if you have a form like a countertop, they make a coaster that kind of goes over to protect
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.300]   your--
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.300]   But I have granite countertops.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.300]   It would work with that.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.300]   It would not work there.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.300]   It would--
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.300]   I don't think so.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.300]   What countertop would be made?
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.300]   Concrete?
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.300]   I don't know.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.300]   Not metal.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.300]   No, not metal.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.300]   I said the whole thing heat up.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.620]   But the little coaster thing is not crazy either.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.180]   It's basically like a little burner that you stick on it.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.180]   How much did you spend, Leo?
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.540]   Wait, but this-- no, but it's for research purposes.
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.540]   I don't know.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.820]   Like Stacy, I know how to saute.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.980]   I know how to do that.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.740]   It's $500 for the pan and the burner.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.780]   Another $300 if you want the chef's pot.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.980]   $300 for one pot?
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.820]   It's got a Bluetooth module on it.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.780]   Yeah, I spent $300 on a pot that doesn't have Bluetooth in it.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.420]   It's-- this will actually be part of the test is are these actually-- is it actually decent
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.420]   cookware?
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.420]   It kind of looks like it might be.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.420]   But it's--
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.420]   You are not too--
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.420]   No, it was nice cookware.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.420]   Like I--
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.820]   Looks a little like all clad or something like that.
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.260]   I use MasterChef, but it looks a little bit like that.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.260]   Wouldn't--
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.860]   I say they don't have the Bluetooth yet.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.860]   Sorry.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.300]   Is there a low-cost Tupperware version?
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.300]   OK.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.300]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.300]   I shouldn't have brought this up.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.540]   But since Stacy was at the cooking event, I thought I'd mention it.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.540]   It was all--
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.540]   Stacy, did you say anything better than this at the event?
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.540]   Oh, I'm sure she did.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.740]   Oh, you guys.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.820]   I can't show it to you because it's for my newsletter this week.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:29.780]   But next week, ask me about the rhodimatic because I did see that and eat the rotis.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.780]   Rhodi, James.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.380]   It's a robot that makes flat threads.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.460]   You talked about the rhodimatic before.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.540]   So you actually sampled the rhodimatic.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.540]   I sampled the rhodimatic.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.660]   Wait, I'm the one who brought this up and you made fun of it.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.820]   This is a $1,000 bread maker basically.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.460]   Yeah, I brought this up on the show.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.980]   And you just poo-pooed this, Ms. I-O-T.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.380]   Well, she now has a different opinion.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.380]   I know.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:57.300]   Well, I don't actually have a-- I would never buy this, but you know what?
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.700]   40,000 people have.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.900]   They have sold 40,000 of these in the US.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:02.900]   1,000 dollars each?
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.900]   Yes.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:04.900]   Yes.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.540]   You know, the only reason I wouldn't buy this is because the last thing I need to do
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.300]   is eat a lot of roti.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.740]   Rhodi is like a-- well, there's non, there's masala.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.740]   There's-- these are those flat threads.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.740]   Big tortillas, too.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.740]   Right at least any flat print, right?
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.740]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:18.740]   It makes tortillas.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:19.740]   It makes personal pizzas.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.740]   This is the last thing I need.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.740]   Poptarts?
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.740]   Follow the light.
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:28.740]   Although, I admit, I came this close to spending $1,000 on a leg of ham.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.740]   Yes, I did.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.740]   So that's not easy.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.740]   Not including the whole--
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.740]   Easy.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:34.740]   Talk him into it.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.740]   That's because of the challenge.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.740]   Before the end of the show, he's got a roti mat that come in here.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.380]   Actually, there's somebody from Barcelona in these studio audience, and I can ask this.
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.380]   We're near Barcelona.
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.380]   I can ask this question.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:47.460]   You-- have you ever had a chamomone barico in your house?
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.660]   Do you have to refrigerate it?
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.020]   You don't refrigerate it?
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.300]   Does it grow mold or something on it?
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.300]   No?
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.980]   You just shave it off and--
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.980]   Keep going.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.980]   OK.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.820]   Leo, Leo, you want this.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.820]   The roti mat?
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.820]   You can make pizza.
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:04.820]   Roti tortilla.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.820]   That's a--
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.540]   I do want this.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.980]   And I love this stuff.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.740]   And the problem is, this is why I stopped baking in general.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.820]   You make it-- you eat it.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.820]   I don't eat it.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.340]   It's like saying, here, here's a $1,000 cookie making machine.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.340]   Basically, yeah, basically it just pops right off.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:25.180]   It comes out like it's like a printer tray in like this hot, warm bread pop tray.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.900]   It's a bread printer.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.500]   Just what I need.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.260]   First of all, do we need to find Stacy's ruling on this prior, though?
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.820]   I just want to-- I just want to go on the record.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.660]   First of all, look at the size of this thing.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.740]   It would take over your kitchen.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.140]   Out of ink.
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.220]   It's like an all-in-one printer.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.300]   It's like a business printer.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.300]   It's Jetsons.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.300]   It's the Jetsons.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.980]   Hey, I'll fax you a roti.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.420]   Well, that would be awesome.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.620]   This kid really is getting into this.
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.180]   So they've sold-- say that again, $40,000?
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.500]   40,000.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.420]   And it's not even for sale in India yet.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.820]   It's only in the US.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.140]   It's going to be huge.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.620]   In Singapore.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.940]   And I want it.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.420]   I would hurt my office.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.140]   Oh, God.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.540]   When you always will have a butter make.
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.700]   How long does it take-- oh, yeah, I don't-- you didn't want to talk about it yet.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.020]   You want to talk about it next week.
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:13.500]   I know.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.780]   Oh, well, it takes-- why just have a video that I took?
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.460]   It takes about 90 seconds to warm up, and then it's about a minute for each roti.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.660]   Oh, instant gratification.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.580]   In five minutes-- you're five minutes away from a roti.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:30.340]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.380]   And this kid-- this kid--
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.660]   10 years from now.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.620]   I have a-- that kid is going to be huge.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.140]   Real huge.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.340]   And the audience here is a friend of mine.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.580]   Jesse, would you buy one?
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.080]   No.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.580]   No.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.460]   Because you'd eat it.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:41.980]   No.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.820]   I actually have made none.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.900]   The roti's not good enough for you?
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.260]   I've made none myself.
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.060]   It's hard to make.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.100]   You got to make the dough.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.860]   You got to let it rise.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.900]   You got to flatten it just so you cook it and to skill it.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:53.980]   It's hard.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.660]   But this actually-- it has it puffed up perfectly.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.660]   You can see it in the--
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.660]   See, that was a problem.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.500]   I wasn't getting puffing.
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.260]   Yeah, it puffs.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.740]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.980]   On the front page of the roti manic website,
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:10.140]   it says they've made 29,605,810 rotis.
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:10.900]   And counting.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.660]   It's like the old McDonald's.
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:13.940]   Right?
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.420]   Yeah.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.460]   How many rotis serve?
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.580]   It does look like a printer.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.260]   I mean, there's a little-- yeah, anyway.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.580]   You don't have to get it for home.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.700]   You could get it for the office.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.220]   Oh!
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.100]   That's a benefit every office should have.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.580]   Because you could just keep it running, right?
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.060]   Yeah.
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.340]   And they wouldn't waste a long time on lunch, Leo.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:33.860]   One minute.
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:34.540]   You got a roti.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:40.260]   Think how much you'd save in inflating.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.140]   Now I'm a little intrigued.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.940]   Please, can he buy a roti manic?
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.380]   So what do you do?
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:48.180]   It has a canister of flour in it?
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.460]   It has flour, oil, and water.
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.060]   So you put those in the top.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.900]   And you can put different types of flour
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.540]   in their software updates.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.780]   I'm sure he's hyperventilating right now.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.900]   And then it makes about 12 to 14 rotis
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.820]   before you need to refill the top.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:04.580]   So--
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.700]   OK, so we need to get canisters of flour as well.
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.940]   Is it roti or roti?
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.820]   Roti.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:11.740]   Roti.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.820]   I call them non.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.820]   I call them non.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.220]   How long are you to put them on?
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.700]   I think it's a different type of bread.
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.220]   Are they to double sided, Stacy?
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:21.860]   Look at that.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.940]   But the United States Treasury does mandate
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:27.380]   that there's a hidden code in every roti.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.220]   Wow, that is why.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.500]   Did the count go up over here?
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.620]   Yeah, the count is going up.
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.780]   Look at that.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.300]   Now, Carson really wants me to buy one of these.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.220]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.020]   And you only have to clean--
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.380]   you clean most of it once a week.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.020]   And then every time you use it or every day,
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.220]   you clean these two little canisters where the dough has been.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.900]   Carson, if I bought one, you would
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:54.220]   have to say I'll be in charge of cleaning it and maintaining it.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.620]   I'm not going anywhere near it.
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.820]   Absolutely.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.660]   He's on the record.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.940]   Burke has already made it.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.780]   That'll be gone from nowhere if I bought it.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:07.020]   Yeah, well, I mean, they're just about to do an upgrade
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.140]   for millet flour, which people love for vegan--
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.220]   I'm going to wait on the millet upgrade.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.220]   Well, no, no, no.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.380]   It's just a software update.
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.900]   It's like your journey is getting--
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.340]   There it is.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.260]   Buy now.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.260]   Buy now.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.860]   Just see what options there are.
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.620]   Just look at it.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.460]   Just look at options there.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.300]   This costs as much as a Pixel 3 phone.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.700]   And a lot more useful.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.060]   It feeds you.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:28.620]   It feeds you.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.420]   That's what I'm going to do.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.100]   Look, it's got a real-time roadie counter.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.500]   There it goes.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.980]   You can buy them in bulk.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.540]   Can you go get in trouble because it's
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.100]   taking a lot of pictures.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.940]   But privacy advocates don't care if you count the roadies.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.380]   What's that?
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.420]   Well, if I get five units, I can get them down to 8.99 each.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.420]   We can do a roadie club.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.220]   But why not?
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.060]   Try my roadie club.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.020]   You could give it to people as a--
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.020]   Oh, we could holiday gift, right?
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:57.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.900]   It's a 30-day full refund guarantee.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:01.780]   Break some water.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:02.220]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.300]   There is limited stock.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.460]   Oh, here we go.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.060]   I'm not going to buy that.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.060]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:09.740]   There are.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:10.060]   I have some.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.380]   I love costing you money.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.540]   I have some limits.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.660]   So let's get back to Google.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.100]   What do you say?
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.100]   You rarely hear me say that, kids, but in this case.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:24.220]   Is there anywhere else you've put pictures, Kevin?
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:27.220]   Because I'd love to see some images.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.740]   I actually have one more to share on this show,
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.260]   but I saved it for the very end.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.060]   Just to make sure you--
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.060]   OK, save it.
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.060]   Yeah.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.340]   I know the notch doesn't bother me.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.860]   I do see it's kind of big, but I think people get used to notches.
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.300]   When I first got the iPhone 10, I thought, oh, I'm not.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.700]   It's just aesthetically--
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:44.460]   It's just aesthetically used to it.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.500]   No, no, it's not.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.500]   It's nothing.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.700]   It's a cluge.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.540]   It's not a cluge's.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.540]   It's not a cluge.
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.620]   It's not ideal.
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:52.620]   I mean, I won't lie.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:53.140]   But you know what?
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:56.700]   I got over it with my iPhone pretty quick.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.780]   I mean, I think the worst thing is when you're
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:02.620]   say watching a video or something, let's mute this.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:06.380]   But it didn't hurt the iPhone 10 sales
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.340]   when they came out with their notch.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.300]   Granted, it's thinner.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.500]   It's longer, but it's thinner.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.460]   I think it'll be fine.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.620]   I think the people who want the pixel
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.700]   are going to get the pixel.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.260]   And you don't see it when you're watching video.
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.780]   That's a point.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.220]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.260]   Unless you do the Zoom in.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.260]   I don't know if I did it or not.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.100]   Oh, yeah, I did.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.780]   Yeah, see.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:23.980]   Right.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.620]   And now you can see.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.140]   Yup.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.740]   Yup.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.140]   So just don't do that.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.060]   And it'll be fine.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.060]   It also has the--
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.460]   The thing I'm most interested in--
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.980]   so there are a couple of things that make camera phones
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.740]   less than suitable as your main camera.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:45.340]   One is it's got a single fixed angle and digital zoom sucks.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:50.100]   They have this capability, they say, of zooming better,
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.900]   super res zoom, and they do it with multiple images.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.300]   You said that's not yet in your camera?
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.460]   No, that's not here.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.500]   And they said they kind of--
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.340]   I don't know if they borrowed the idea or leveraged technology.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.380]   They said this is how we take photos of Mars.
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.060]   We clean them up.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:08.220]   It's algorithms and interpolation and all that.
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.700]   So the demos look fine, but that is not here yet.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.620]   On my unit.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.620]   So that's one issue that--
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.940]   because I mean, the resolution, the quality of the image
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.300]   is really very good.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.260]   So if you had zoom--
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.740]   because that's a big problem, that's
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.780]   something I can do with a real camera, even a point and shoot
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.340]   that I can't do with a camera phone.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.980]   What was the other issue?
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.140]   The selfie zoom maybe?
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.300]   Are you thinking?
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.860]   Or why I'm thinking of--
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.940]   No, I'm thinking of the shutter lag.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.940]   So this has always been a problem is the time to picture.
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.700]   And they're sort of solving that with the top shot.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.300]   Correct.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:47.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.740]   That's not going to be an issue, I don't think.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.980]   At least I've not seen that issue.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.940]   It is a selfie camera, a wide angle?
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.740]   Yes.
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.140]   So they--
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.340]   Two lenses, right?
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:56.860]   Two lenses.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.620]   They do have two lenses for the portrait mode.
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.300]   I don't know if I can do this or not.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.660]   I kind of put you in selfie mode.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.140]   It's kind of hard to see, I suppose.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.900]   But there's a zoom feature down at the bottom,
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.940]   where you can zoom in and zoom out.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.540]   See if I can get it.
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.260]   So it combines two images?
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.580]   No, no, it actually--
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.940]   Well, it's not switching.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.380]   There's something in between.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:19.940]   It's just two lenses.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.980]   It's just two lenses, you say.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.940]   Yeah, there are two lenses.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.180]   I don't think it switches for that.
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.340]   That's more for portrait mode.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.140]   So that's zoomed out.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.260]   That's more wide angle.
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:31.900]   And then if I slide over, I can go in for close up selfie.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.460]   I think it's nice.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.180]   Again, the question will be, is that digital?
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:35.940]   Is it optical?
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.060]   Is it-- how good is it look?
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.300]   What I'm asking is, when you hold it out,
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.700]   you get more people in selfie.
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.300]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.260]   OK, but do they have the fisheye effect?
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.700]   They do not.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.700]   That I know of.
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:47.980]   I do not get it in my selfie mode.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.980]   No, the big nose, the giant nose.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.500]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.460]   I was going to say, yeah.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.980]   I think this actually does switch between the two cameras,
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:54.700]   now that you mentioned.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.060]   And the only reason I say that, not that they told me this,
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.420]   but on the zoom level, when I switch across the very center
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.980]   of it, meaning not zoom, so it was zoom in or zoom out,
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.900]   it kind of jumps a little bit like it is switching cameras.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.820]   So if you just put your thumb over the camera,
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.260]   over one of the cameras.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.580]   Well, then I wouldn't get to see anything.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.700]   Oh, yeah, OK.
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.820]   Yeah, you could tell very quickly.
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.380]   And they called Jeff, because here you go, let's see.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.140]   I'll zoom over and it's scarce.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.260]   Yeah, so yes.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.180]   That's pretty-- that's all processing.
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:22.700]   Yeah.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.420]   It combined two images on two cameras seamlessly.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:26.940]   That's very smart.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.580]   It's a Qualcomm 845 chip.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.460]   That's a nice fast chip, although according
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.220]   to recent benchmarks on the iPhone XS,
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.660]   it really doesn't hold a candle to the iPhone XS.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:39.180]   On the other hand, how much speed do you need in a smartphone?
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.700]   And I think there's a big difference
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.740]   by adding that DSP chip for image processing.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.420]   Then you're not relying on the 845 for all the work
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.260]   you're doing in the camera.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.380]   I think--
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.060]   This is a promising phone.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.180]   How about the screen?
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:56.180]   Remember the-- it's funny, this was when the Pixel 2 came out,
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.340]   everybody was bitching about the screen and burning it.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.940]   Yeah, and blue and then this and the one.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.300]   And you don't hear much about that.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.900]   I don't know if it's because people stopped buying it,
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.260]   or because it really wasn't as big a problem.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.260]   How do you feel about the screen on the Pixel 3, Kevin?
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.940]   So I remember that issue.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:17.180]   They had some-- I would call it bad product, bad screens,
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.220]   probably.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.340]   I think they were using LG at the time.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.580]   I suspect that they have switched over to a different partner,
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.900]   and that is very likely Samsung for this display,
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.100]   because it's at least as good as the-- say, the Galaxy 9s
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.700]   and whatnot.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.100]   I think it looks fantastic.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.300]   That's pretty good.
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.420]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.500]   But you know what, Kevin?
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.740]   I have the original first screen,
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:43.340]   and I think Leo's point is, whatever it was that was a problem,
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:47.740]   I'm completely used to it and don't notice the problem.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.060]   Well, and not everybody had the problem.
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.380]   So it could have been different production runs and so on.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.420]   And it's hard to say, Jeff, to be honest,
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.980]   because when you mass produce these things,
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.780]   you're dealing with supply chain issues and whatnot.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:00.780]   If you're used to it, then you're
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.220]   going to be thrilled when you see this,
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.660]   because you're not going to--
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.820]   it's going to look fantastic to you, I think.
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.500]   Yeah, but Jeff may not be getting it,
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.620]   because he's saving his money forward.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:10.060]   It's going to be in Kevin's hand.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.660]   A roadie maker.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.580]   If nothing else, they promoted the use of roadie
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:23.620]   as a word in America, and that I'd commend them for.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.460]   Let's take a break, and then we'll finally--
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.980]   I've even been very good.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:31.580]   You've been very good holding off deferred satisfaction.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.500]   We'll talk about the Pixelbook Slate.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.660]   Oh, and the home, you have a home as well, right?
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.340]   And the Pixelbook.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.780]   The home.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.060]   There's just a new Pixelbook.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.780]   There's Justin is Slate.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.100]   Yeah, just a new--
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:42.820]   No new Pixelbook.
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.700]   Oh, they didn't know--
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.660]   --on Pixelbook.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.100]   Yeah, that was one of the rumors was there'll be a Pixelbook
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.260]   that it not materialized.
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.340]   And then there is this Google Home Hub,
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.780]   which I'm sure you and Stacy talked about this morning.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:54.780]   For hours.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.460]   For hours.
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.580]   So long.
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.540]   We'll get the boiled down version of that in just a bit.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.540]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.660]   And Quick and Loans, the best lender in the country, number
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.460]   one in customer satisfaction.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.540]   Eight years in a row now, according to JD Power,
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.980]   Rocket Mortgage is actually a creation of Quick and Loans.
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.580]   When you're customer centric, any company that
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.380]   says customers first, and a service company,
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.060]   that's really important, I just love it.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.220]   It just makes me happy because I'm a customer, right?
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.260]   And so Quick and Loans, one of the ways
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.980]   they become the biggest lender in the nation
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.020]   is by really thinking about the customer experience.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.220]   That's why they created Rocket Mortgage.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.620]   Instead of going to a bank and filling out a long application,
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.300]   doing a lot of research, going to the ad
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.860]   to get old bank statements or calling your former employers
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.900]   to get old pay stubs, they do all that work for you.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.980]   And Rocket Mortgage is entirely online.
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.500]   So you don't even have to leave your armchair
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.300]   or your open house.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.500]   You just go to rocketmortgage.com/twig
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.300]   and the whole process happens there.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.500]   And it happens fast.
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.380]   Actually, it's a three-step process.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.740]   Quick and Loans calls Rocket Mortgage's process,
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.700]   the power buying process.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.500]   So step one, we've talked about this before,
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.940]   you go to rocketmortgage.com/twig, create an account,
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.860]   answer a few simple questions.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.140]   They'll check your credit and you get pre-qualified approval.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.220]   And you get to, at that point, pick the term, the rate,
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:18.860]   the down payment, everything.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.420]   And within, and this is 10 minutes.
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:25.460]   So this is already way ahead of anything any bank can do.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.580]   But then step two, over the next 24 hours,
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:33.140]   they will verify your income, your assets, and your credit.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.420]   And they will give you verified approval.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.060]   Now that's huge because that's basically
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.060]   saying you got the loan.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.060]   You get a letter that says, you know,
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.740]   this is, they have verified approval.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.860]   That means you're basically a cash buyer
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.620]   when you go to make an offer on a house.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.300]   The seller says, oh, well, you know,
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.380]   you go right to the front of the line
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.700]   because unlike the other bidder, or two or three
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.300]   these days, it's very competitive.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.860]   You don't, it's not a contingency.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.140]   You don't have to get a loan.
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.340]   You've got a loan.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.980]   You're verified.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.820]   So that's fantastic.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.860]   And let's add step three, which is unique
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.340]   to a rocket mortgage.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.420]   It's all new.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.260]   And I love it.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.700]   It's called, they call it rate shield approval.
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:14.540]   And this wasn't an issue in years, in last few years,
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.620]   because the interest rates were very stable.
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.460]   They're going up now.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.860]   You probably noticed that the Fed's raising rates,
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.700]   home loan rates are going up.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.460]   As a result, there's some uncertainty.
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.740]   When you're out there at home hunting,
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.380]   you're saying, oh, we better buy quick
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.140]   because what if the rates go up,
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.020]   it's a quarter interest point on a 30 year loan
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.860]   might mean tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.380]   So that's a big deal.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.260]   And that's pressure.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.500]   That means there's some anxiety.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.020]   It means you feel like, I gotta buy, I gotta buy now.
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.540]   And you don't want that.
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.140]   So what they've done, once you get verified approval
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.740]   is they lock in the rate.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:49.060]   This is rate shield approval for up to 90 days.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.740]   So you have up to three months to shop
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.180]   and the rate can't go up.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.940]   Even if the Fed raises it,
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.420]   even if the LIBOR goes up or whatever the loan's based on,
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.620]   it goes up, your rate is locked.
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.620]   It's guaranteed.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.580]   Here's another nice feature.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:05.260]   If the rates go down, your rate goes down.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.220]   So it just can't go up.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.060]   I love that.
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.020]   Either way you win.
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.940]   That's because that's customer centric, right?
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.140]   That's thinking about, ah, you know,
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.140]   there's some anxiety here about rates.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.100]   Let's fix that.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.180]   Rocket Mortgage.com/twig.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.220]   Rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30 year
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.380]   purchase transactions, additional conditions or exclusions
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.220]   might apply.
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.460]   It's based on quick and loans data
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.460]   in comparison to public data records.
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.540]   Of course, they're equal housing lender,
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.020]   licensed in all 50 states,
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.820]   and MLS consumer access.org numbered 30, 30.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.620]   You don't have to remember all that.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:39.220]   Just remember rocketmortgage.com/twig
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:43.820]   and take advantage of the power buying process entirely online.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.540]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:49.500]   You know, when you go to the bank to get that loan,
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.620]   we went to the big bank when we bought our house five years ago,
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:56.740]   Lisa and I, and you have to kind of get all cleaned up.
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.020]   Banks don't lend money to people who need the money.
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:44:59.860]   This is what you learn.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.820]   They only see you have to look prosperous.
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.700]   I don't need your money.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.820]   I'm just here to inquire about a loan.
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.420]   I'm ready for my loan.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.420]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.420]   You can do it in your jammies.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.700]   All right, now, let's--
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.740]   So I'm breaking headline the Verge.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:20.580]   Google failed to justify the Pixel 3 XL's massive notch.
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.820]   This is such a pogosity.
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.820]   Wait, did they talk about the massive price increase?
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:26.820]   Let's have them justify that.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.260]   Is it a massive price increase?
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.220]   I thought I spent about that much online, the two.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.420]   I think it's like 100 bucks more, at least, if not 100.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.420]   I don't know if you're 50.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.700]   I mean, mine was--
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.500]   I feel like mine was 700.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:43.980]   So right now, you get a Pixel 2 for 745 bucks.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.100]   That's, I think, 50 bucks off.
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:47.140]   Yeah, that's a little price.
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.580]   That was.
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:53.460]   But maybe that's-- is that the Pixel 2 XL, in which case,
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.340]   it would be 100 bucks less than the Pixel 3 XL?
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.460]   But I think this--
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.180]   I don't know if it's a massive price increase.
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:05.940]   And part of the problem is that I buy iPhones.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:10.340]   So I paid for the last iPhone, 1,250 bucks.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.460]   And that's not even the most expensive one you can get,
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.020]   I don't think.
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.460]   So jump.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:17.900]   Did you just say jump?
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:19.820]   I caught.
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:23.740]   I'm looking for my receipt from the Google Store last November.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:24.460]   I'll just find that.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.260]   Actually, I could do that.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:31.980]   Yeah, because-- well, it's a virtual receipt.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.620]   Yeah, here it is.
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.820]   That's a good question.
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.900]   How much did it cost last time around?
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.140]   Oh, that was my live case.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.700]   Not helpful.
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:42.060]   That was 40 bucks.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:48.380]   So I bought a Pixel 2 XL for $949.
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:52.980]   Ended up with tax to be $1,026 October 4, 2017.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.900]   So that's 128 gigs.
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:47:00.180]   So it's 50 bucks less than what I paid this time for the same.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.940]   I got the Pixel 2 64 gigabytes for $649.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.380]   So I paid $702.54.
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.580]   So that would be $749 now.
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:10.740]   So it is 100 bucks more.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.740]   OK.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.660]   All right, well, those are the points, Daisy.
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.100]   I guess they figured Apple has shown
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.500]   that you can get that kind of money for a high-end flagship.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.340]   And let's do it.
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.740]   I mean, Samsung's getting up there.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.380]   So they might as well sell price.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.700]   Yeah, but I mean--
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.180]   Yeah.
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.100]   I mean, the stand is $80, which is way over price, too.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:34.140]   I mean, that's Apple accessory land.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.660]   They did give us a USB-C headphones.
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:37.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.700]   And an adapter, which Apple has now left out of the box--
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:41.900]   Which is ridiculous.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.380]   I mean, talk about cheap, because Apple
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.260]   knows you pay 20 bucks for that adapter,
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.860]   if you really want to use it.
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.860]   Apple's excuse on that was, oh, we found out nobody uses wired
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.260]   headphones anymore.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.140]   None on our--
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.460]   I love one.
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.420]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.420]   We asked three people in none of them.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:47:59.940]   Nobody.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.020]   None of them use headphones.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.020]   Nobody on the Apple campus.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.380]   All right.
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:09.700]   Let's talk about this late, because poor Jeff is just
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.300]   ready to write a check.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.820]   The Pixel Slate.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:14.620]   Now, pricing is confusing on this,
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:18.940]   because this keyboard and the pen are separate.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:19.420]   Correct.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.580]   But if you have an old pen, it will work with the slate.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:25.180]   Ah, so the pen that came with the Pixelbook 2 will work--
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.380]   But to come with, I had to buy it.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.300]   Oh, you bought that one.
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:27.940]   That's great.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:28.780]   That was $100.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.660]   I'm going to jump.
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:30.900]   What do you think of the keyboard?
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.500]   This is the bridge BRY DGE keyboard.
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.820]   I know Jeff hates bridges.
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.780]   That's actually the Google keyboard for $199.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:43.100]   And that is an amazing keyboard.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:47.340]   But I talked to the head of product management here at Google
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.700]   and said, look, I'm obviously going to buy this,
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.540]   and I will buy the keyboard as well as the slate.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.660]   But people are going to bulk at a $200 keyboard
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:00.100]   when Microsoft sells theirs for $99 to $129.
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:04.300]   And Apple sells theirs for $159, I believe.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:08.660]   And the response was, look, here's the deal.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.340]   If people want a keyboard, they'll have choice of keyboards.
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.980]   And the bridge model actually is $159.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:14.460]   Oh, OK.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:15.540]   So there's that.
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.500]   And that's more of a traditional laptop-type keyboard
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.540]   experience.
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.820]   They said to justify this price, they said, look,
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.940]   we're giving you a large class trackpad that works with the mouse.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:27.340]   iOS doesn't have that at all.
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.060]   So you're not even getting that with an Apple keyboard.
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:33.660]   And we have adjustable angles, infinite adjustable,
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.900]   which this, I thought, from an engineering standpoint was brilliant.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:40.060]   You can take that back cover, and there
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:44.100]   are magnets in the rails of the pixel slate in the back of it.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.660]   And you can adjust it to any angle you would like.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.060]   It's fantastic.
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.500]   It's kind of smooth, do it looks like, right?
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.820]   Yes, that is correct.
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:54.700]   So that's what--
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.620]   You know, the response I gave you is telling to me.
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.820]   Because as we're looking at this, and as we're looking
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.660]   at pricing, I'm wondering, there's two ways you could go.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.420]   Is this to compete with a Surface Pro, the Windows tablet,
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.620]   which also has a separate keyboard and pen?
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:12.660]   Or is this to compete with the iPad Pro?
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:15.500]   And it sounded like they were referring to the iPad.
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:19.580]   So they see this as the iPad as the natural competitor.
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.700]   I guess that's what they see it as.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.220]   I was going to say the answer to your question is yes.
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.900]   This is a true competitor to both, in my opinion.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:27.380]   It's both.
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.940]   Yes.
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.300]   Granted-- and that's because you're getting a desktop browser,
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.220]   so you get the desktop feel of Microsoft, obviously not
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:39.140]   the legacy apps, although they did say this will support
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.740]   the Linux apps, as well.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.860]   And then you get the mobile experience of the touchscreen
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.300]   and Android apps.
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.400]   So it's kind of attacking both, in my opinion.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.400]   That's a good point.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.180]   If you run it with Android apps, then it's an iPad replacement.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.300]   If you run it with the Chrome browser,
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.060]   it's more like Windows, although there aren't Windows apps.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.700]   Although there's a pretty good set
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:50:59.900]   of apps available for the Chrome browser.
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.780]   So Kevin, you and I have talked about this before.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:08.340]   I'm still concerned on my beautiful pixel.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:12.180]   The Android apps just aren't great.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.060]   Anything that has DRM is a pain in the butt
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.140]   and doesn't work very well.
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:21.540]   And trying to go back and forth with apps not built
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:25.620]   for the larger screen, a Chrome tablet--
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:29.500]   just full stop, Chrome tablet versus Android tablet--
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:34.500]   I'm still concerned about how mature Chrome is for this use.
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.260]   What's your thought?
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:40.660]   Well, it's a totally fair point.
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:44.180]   I tend to use the browser when I can instead of apps
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.020]   because, say for Netflix--
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.100]   because I know you've had issues with Netflix,
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.100]   the Android app version.
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.540]   Yes, you might want to download Netflix videos
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:54.580]   and watch them, and you can do that with the Android version
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.340]   if it's working well for you.
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:00.860]   I go with the browser because you get higher resolution,
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.420]   partially because of the DRM.
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.460]   And I don't have to worry about an app.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.660]   But you can't download for the plane?
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.420]   No, you can't.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.980]   You're in international lands where I am a lot.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.220]   And that's totally valid.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:13.940]   You're absolutely right.
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.780]   That's a limitation for sure.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.700]   Google has really put the framework out there
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.020]   for app developers and these large companies, such as Netflix,
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.100]   for example, to make it work.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:25.540]   And they just haven't for some reason.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.940]   I'm not sure why.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:30.140]   I think the market is tiny, right?
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.260]   You know, I guess, yeah, if you're
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.220]   going to invest the time and effort resources
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:34.780]   to developing mobile apps, you're
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.420]   going to go where mobile app engagement is the highest.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.220]   And people are doing things on iPads and iPhones.
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.820]   And that's where a lot of folks focus their efforts
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.420]   when it comes to third party stuff.
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.300]   So I don't know what Google can really do unless they say, look,
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:48.900]   we'll help you.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:52.940]   We'll put some engineering time behind it and just make it better.
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:56.860]   I kind of wish they would do that and put some resources
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.060]   behind helping these guys.
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.860]   Because other than that, I don't know what they can do,
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.140]   Jeff.
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.260]   That's the problem.
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:08.220]   I talked to a product head from Chrome OS at I/O.
[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:13.220]   And he was arguing surprise at the problem with Netflix.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.980]   But it's obviously there.
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:15.660]   It's difficult.
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:16.980]   It crashes a lot.
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:17.740]   It doesn't come all on.
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.260]   It doesn't remember things.
[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.340]   And then the further problem I have
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:26.100]   is guess what I'm going to complain about being a G Suite user,
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:31.620]   trying to install new apps into Chrome is just torture.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.740]   It's 87 steps.
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:35.180]   It's easier to become a citizen these days.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.380]   Yeah, that's a problem.
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.460]   And I think I go back to Google on that one.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:43.500]   They never really thought that out well.
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.140]   I don't think they figured merimortals and consumers
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:50.300]   would get G Suite accounts that was really geared towards,
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:52.380]   say, enterprise and small business.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:54.260]   But now that's created a whole problem.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.820]   And I know they're working on it because I've seen code
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:00.940]   changes about adding certain flags and features
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:04.980]   to control in the Google Chrome admin stuff.
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.820]   So one of the questions I get all the time
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.500]   about Chromebooks is, hey, how do I
[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:12.020]   get Google Assistant on my Pixelbook?
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:13.940]   The first question I ask is, well, do you have a G Suite
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:14.420]   account?
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:15.620]   And here are the steps you have to do.
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:16.860]   Here's the support page.
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:17.180]   It is.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.060]   You've got to jump through a lot of hoops.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:26.460]   All right, so that's Chrome as tablet app and Chrome OS G Suite
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:29.460]   Android not working well together, my two concerns.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.740]   So the other question I'll ask is just simply,
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.660]   if today you didn't have a Pixelbook,
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:39.340]   you didn't have a slate, which would you buy?
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:42.500]   So I personally and granted, the pricing
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:43.900]   is high on the slate in my opinion.
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.980]   We'll get to the pricing in a bit, I'm sure.
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:48.940]   I personally would go with a Pixel slate.
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:50.980]   And that is because even with the Pixelbook,
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.100]   and I have a Surface Pro as well for class,
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:57.660]   I use those in tablet mode at least 50% of the time,
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.380]   because when I'm not working, writing, coding, whatever,
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:04.460]   I'm watching Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube TV, et cetera.
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.740]   And I prefer to have just a portable screen
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:10.820]   that I can hold or stand up next to me wherever I am.
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:13.740]   The other reason, again, for me, and maybe for everybody else,
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:16.660]   in fact, the Pixelbook did not get a refresh,
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.340]   as we said earlier on the show.
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:21.700]   It is running the seventh gen Intel processors,
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:26.100]   whereas the Pixel slate has the eighth gen Intel processor.
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.540]   So, and it has either range of processors
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:31.580]   from Celeron to M3 to i5 to i7.
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.700]   So you're getting better performance
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.500]   and probably better power efficiency as well.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.300]   Google said 12 hours of mixed use on the slate,
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:41.780]   which is amazing because that's seven millimeters thin
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:43.140]   that slate.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.820]   So it's crammed with battery.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.260]   In fact, the battery is all around the corners
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.100]   of the device.
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.540]   The boards are in the very middle.
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:52.620]   So that way it is completely balanced.
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:53.460]   However you hold it.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:54.780]   - Oh, that's interesting. - That's nice.
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:56.020]   - Yeah, very well designed.
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:58.660]   - And this keyboard is constantly trickled charge
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:02.900]   the way the old Pixel tablet keyboard did.
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.340]   - Nope. - You got a charge
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.380]   the keyboard? - Nope.
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:07.860]   - It gets its power from the face.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.460]   - Oh, it gets the power from the face.
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:11.340]   - Okay, just like an iPad.
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:12.700]   - This is not Bluetooth, right?
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:13.700]   It's connected. - It's got these
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:14.540]   - It's got these-- - That is a program
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.940]   right, right, right. - Yes.
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:18.500]   - Google's uses the Pogo pins, so there's no battery
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.300]   or anything needed.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:23.580]   It gets all this data and power from the slate itself.
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.780]   Bridge is offering their G-type keyboard
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.820]   and that is Bluetooth.
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.340]   So it's not using the Pogo pins.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:31.900]   You do have to charge that.
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.340]   They say every, I think, three to six months,
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.580]   but I mean, if you're using that thing full time,
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:37.740]   I don't know about that.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:41.300]   My issue with the Bluetooth is I have seen,
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.780]   I've used Bluetooth keyboards with
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:47.460]   my Pixelbook and tablet mode, for example, just for testing.
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.740]   And sometimes the on-screen keyboard pops up
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.140]   while it's trying to get re-established
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:53.260]   a connection to the hardware keyboard.
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.220]   See, it's just not cohesive as one unit
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.020]   whereas the Google keyboard is.
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.980]   And it's not a knock on bridge.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:02.060]   They've always used Bluetooth, so maybe they will change now
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:04.220]   in the future and go with Pogo pins
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:09.220]   for their iPad Pro keyboards and the Pixel Slate, I don't know.
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:14.620]   So I use, I obviously write a lot, some would say too much.
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:21.420]   Writing on the slate versus the Pixelbook.
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:25.900]   - So I would just give you first impressions
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:28.100]   because anytime I use a different keyboard,
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:30.380]   I usually give myself a couple of days to get used to it.
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.700]   Saying that, I spent about an hour,
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:35.100]   maybe an hour and a half with the two different keyboards.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.780]   The bridge keyboard is very much like
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:39.540]   the actual keyboard of the Pixelbook.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:43.820]   The Google keyboard is quite good also.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.140]   It took me a little bit of time
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:47.980]   to kind of get the feel of those circular keys.
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:50.580]   But Google said, and we asked about this,
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:53.740]   Google said, when we did some research
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:56.820]   and we found that people are actually more accurate
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.900]   with the circular keys because they're less likely
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:02.020]   to hit other keys because of the spacing.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:02.980]   Now whether that's true or not,
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:04.940]   I don't know, I haven't done any tests on my own,
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.340]   but it does make sense.
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.700]   - I'm very interested in that.
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.860]   You won't hear the keys either, Jeff, at all.
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.540]   They're very quiet. - Hush keys.
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.140]   - Hush keys, it's amazing.
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:17.020]   - But there's decent travel?
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.060]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.540]   - Oh, okay, yeah, 'cause that's what I,
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.340]   I like the clickety of my keys.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.460]   - You wanna know your accomplishes something right, Stacey?
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:28.340]   - Exactly, plus it helps me get my emotion out
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.580]   and my writing, I'm like, I'm--
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:30.420]   (laughing)
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:31.580]   - She's a bad person. - I'm sure there's a chroma
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:32.420]   key for her. - She's a good person.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.260]   - So you get an installer,
[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.340]   it just makes a noise every time you get the key.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:40.220]   - So it's a really interesting product idea
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:43.180]   because they mentioned, they didn't mention Kristini,
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.780]   but they did say it'll run Linux apps,
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.060]   so Kristini's enabled on this.
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:49.740]   So you can run, if you're a high end user,
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:54.460]   you can run high end command line based apps
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.740]   from the GNU/Linux world.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:02.540]   You can run Android and it is a powerful device.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:06.180]   - This is, but the problem is the power comes at a great,
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:08.540]   great with great power comes great price.
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:10.460]   - Yes. - So the base unit,
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.420]   the one they quote, the 599 unit,
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.260]   which is a Celeron 4GB of RAM, which I think is ample,
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:21.780]   and 32GB storage or 6GB of RAM and 64GB storage
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:24.220]   starts at 599, although I think you'll pay more
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:26.260]   for the 8GB version.
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:29.340]   Then there's a M3, that's the mobile,
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.780]   kind of crappy mobile Intel processor,
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:34.620]   better than a Celeron 799.
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:37.580]   You can get an i5, that's probably what's in your Pixelbook,
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:39.980]   Jeff, about the $1,000 Pixelbook.
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.900]   That's the same price.
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:42.740]   - Correct. - In fact,
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:46.340]   spec-wise, this eighth generation i5 processor
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:49.220]   is the same price minus the keyboard and pen
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.420]   as your Pixelbook is.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.020]   - So this costs more, in other words.
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:55.460]   - Yeah, and you may want to, but what's nice is it,
[00:59:55.460 --> 01:00:00.220]   the i7 processor includes 16GB of RAM, 250GB storage,
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.460]   but I can't remember, I think that,
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.740]   was that a $1,300?
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.940]   - I think so. - Skew for the Pixelbook.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.940]   - No, I think it's $1,499, at least.
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:10.940]   - So this one is $1,599 for this late.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.900]   - Plus that also had 512GB of storage.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.980]   - No, that's right, it's more storage.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.580]   Although, I don't know why anybody wants a lot of storage.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:22.260]   - Well, let's store it on a whole lot of Netflix, but.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:23.260]   - Maybe.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.900]   - So you know why I can't get this?
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.780]   - Why?
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:26.820]   - This show.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.660]   - Why?
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:28.500]   - This guy.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.340]   - Oh, you don't have,
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.940]   you got, you know, I'm in the freaking hotel,
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.300]   Carson's gonna kill me.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.500]   So I'm in the freaking hotel room.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.380]   - You can't really use Skype on these, can you?
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.460]   - Skype on this doesn't work,
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.700]   and so I take along my Android tablet,
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.220]   and Skype is better on that.
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.460]   - Right.
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.740]   - But Skype on a Chrome device?
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.140]   - We'll work with a darn.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:49.740]   - We should figure out, while you're here, in fact,
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.380]   before you leave, we should figure out some alternative
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.620]   that you can use on your Chromebook,
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.020]   like Hangouts or something.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.980]   - Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:59.700]   - Can't we do that, Carson and John?
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.540]   - What about Zoom?
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:01.660]   - You know Zoom works well.
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:02.500]   - Does Zoom work well?
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.500]   - Blue jeans works well.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500]   - All right, we can use Zoom.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.340]   - Yeah, I've never tried Zoom.
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.500]   We should try to--
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.340]   - Zoom or Blue jeans.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.620]   - We'd have to, on our machines,
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.380]   Carson put a, no, Zoom is,
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.820]   you know, you need a Zoom client,
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.020]   but it's in the browser, right?
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:15.860]   - I think so.
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:16.700]   - On both ends, I think.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:17.540]   - I think it's on the browser.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.380]   - I don't want to, okay.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.220]   - You're real, it's there.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.060]   - I've never used it before.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.820]   - So we should try a couple of things.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.220]   - The other thing I'm thinking about doing is buying
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.260]   the cheapest Microsoft tablet so I can get Skype.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.460]   - Yeah, but you don't want to carry it.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.300]   - I don't want to carry it.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.460]   - You know, you don't want to carry it more than one.
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.460]   - All right, enough of Jeff.
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:33.260]   - I actually think this is overpriced.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:34.100]   I have to think.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.020]   - Or, or.
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:35.860]   - Or, or.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:36.700]   - Or, or.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:40.660]   - You could use Skype for Linux once Google
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:45.260]   has the audio capabilities in the project Christina added.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.100]   - Yeah.
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.900]   - They don't currently, but you can't even get this yet.
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:51.580]   You have some time, they have some time, I guess,
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.900]   to get it in there maybe before the pre-orders all start.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.180]   So we'll have to see that once that's there Jeff,
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.380]   'cause I all run in the same problem with the IOT podcast
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.060]   that Stacy and I do for example.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:04.660]   Now I do have the Surface Pro and that's what I use
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:08.540]   right now for podcasting, but if I can do it on the slate
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:09.860]   with Linux.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.500]   - Yeah, I'd be happier too.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.820]   - Yep.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.140]   - Right now it's wait list and you can't buy it.
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.220]   What did they say when it would be available later
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.340]   this month or November?
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:21.940]   - I pushed really hard with the PR folks.
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:23.940]   They were laughing at me, almost crying.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.700]   I was pushing so hard to get a, to get a release date.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.380]   And then I spoke to the product manager
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.900]   and he kind of gave me a murky little smile
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:33.300]   and he just said, "Year in, by year in."
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:38.300]   But I did find out today that Best Buy temporarily had
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.860]   at listing for all of these Pixel Slates
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:44.980]   showing a release date of November 22nd.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.980]   That has been changed, but I grabbed a screenshot
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.580]   before they changed it.
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.500]   So I thought about it and I'm like,
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.060]   "You know, why would that be?
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.820]   Why is it not ready yet?"
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:58.220]   Well, the Pixel Slate that I used, all of them actually,
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.100]   they were all running the dev channel version 71.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.020]   And there were still some software glitches,
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.660]   there's still some things in the commit log
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.620]   that they're working on, minor hardware things.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.540]   I suspect that when 71 rolls out,
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:12.040]   that's kind of what the hold up is here.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.460]   Some of my readers have said,
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.860]   "Well, the FCC has not approved this yet.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:21.220]   There's fine print underneath the Google store listing
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:22.060]   for this."
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:27.220]   And I get that, but the iPhone XR also has that same listing,
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.460]   just 'cause it hasn't been approved yet,
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:30.100]   doesn't mean that's what they're rating on.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.580]   - How impressive is this screen?
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:34.500]   - The screen specs are fantastic.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:39.500]   3000 by 2000, which is almost 300 pixels per inch,
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.540]   12.3 inches.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:43.980]   I wish it didn't have such massive bezels.
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.900]   - Google and bezels, they should think of it.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.540]   - Google loves its bezels.
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.700]   - But part of the argument on the bezels is handling.
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:52.700]   - Yep.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.540]   - I guess.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:57.100]   - Yeah, again, I'm not anti-bezel.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.340]   - So what does it look like, Kevin?
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:01.180]   'Cause you're the one who's seen it.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.580]   - So I'm kind of like a screen snob,
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.500]   like, you know, as soon as 4K TVs came out and HDR TV,
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.260]   so I'm upgrading, upgrading, upgrading.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:11.980]   I was blown away, I gotta be honest.
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.660]   - That's gonna be the biggest difference
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:16.180]   between this and a pixel book.
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:20.340]   - Yes, yes, because it's, it seemed brighter to me.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.580]   I don't know the exact brightness on the specs,
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:26.500]   but when we looked at some 4K videos, HDR videos,
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.020]   I mean, I'm like, wow, this looks fantastic.
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.740]   I can't find out for sure if it's a true HDR display,
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:32.980]   but it looked like it to me.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.200]   I mean, again, I was just blown away.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.940]   And they got some new technology in there too.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.460]   They're calling this molecular display where,
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.260]   I'm certainly not a physicist or a scientist,
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:45.660]   but this sounded weird to me.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.220]   They make the electrons move 100 times faster
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:50.220]   than other LCD panels.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.540]   - Right, hey, where'd you go?
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:52.260]   - And I'm like, how do you do that?
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.660]   I mean, you should be able to get it for Mars in three days.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:56.180]   (laughing)
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.820]   - So which one would each of you buy?
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:04:59.660]   If you're gonna buy one of those?
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.780]   - Well, you're gonna have to get at least the I5.
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:02.940]   - Yeah, I find.
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.420]   - I think that's what I'm gonna do.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:07.420]   I mean, I think mainstream people who wanna spend
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.380]   a little more than your average mid-range Chromebook
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.940]   would be fine with the Celeron or the M3.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:14.700]   I'd probably go M3 if I were them,
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:18.100]   but I will go with the I5 and the 8G of RAM
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.380]   and that storage because that's what I have in my Pixelbook.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:23.220]   I run Linux apps, I compile some code on it,
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.260]   I do Android apps, everything I need to do.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.940]   - And you would use this and steady your Pixelbook.
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.140]   You would replace it.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:30.780]   - Oh, my Pixelbook, I already have talked to two people
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.100]   who are interested in buying my Pixelbook.
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.100]   Absolutely, it's going away.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.940]   - Oh, geez, you are heartless.
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:37.460]   - Well, I should put out a big jump in price
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:40.060]   from $9.99 to $15.99.
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.020]   - But you're still, you see, you're at $12.99,
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:45.940]   you're $1,300, $1,200 here with the keyboard.
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.580]   - Oh yeah, don't forget, keyboard's 200 and the pen is--
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.420]   - Plus service, $2.50.
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:52.060]   - You already have the $99 pens, you need to buy that.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:52.980]   - Plus service.
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.380]   - And you're gonna buy the service, huh?
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.940]   Yeah, I mean, it's expensive.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.340]   There's no question, it's expensive.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.460]   - It's gotta be your sole machine.
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.460]   It's gotta, that price.
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:04.980]   It ain't just some tablet thing, it is your sole machine.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.420]   - Yes, the Pixelbook has been my sole machine.
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.380]   Except for podcasting, quite honestly.
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:10.460]   - Same here.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:11.300]   - Yeah.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.940]   - So I would not be the first in line to buy it in general,
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:19.140]   just because Google's had troubles in the past,
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:23.020]   and I, this, you know, I just, I would give it a month.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:23.860]   - But you bought the phone.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.220]   - See the reviews, the phone, we know what the phone is.
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.420]   - Let me ask you this, Leo, because you use
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.220]   a Pixelbook today.
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.980]   So what does your Pixelbook not do?
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.420]   Since you bought it, I mean, it meets--
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:36.900]   - No, the Pixelbook's fine, I don't need this late at all.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:37.740]   - Yeah.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:38.580]   - Well, the Pixelbook's fine.
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:41.740]   - But really, this is a Pixelbook, the power of the Pixelbook,
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.340]   the same basic configuration.
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:44.460]   - Here's the three things you get,
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:46.860]   you don't get a Pixelbook, we mentioned the screen.
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:49.620]   Battery life is a lot better, it sounds like.
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:52.380]   Do you, you haven't had it long enough to really know.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.220]   - No.
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.420]   - But if it lives up to the spec and, and, you know,
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.660]   it sounds like they've really made an attempt to put
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:00.060]   all, more than all day battery life in it.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.060]   And the third thing, I don't know how important this is,
[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.140]   it sounds like they get better cameras in it.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:05.960]   And there's front and back.
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.680]   Which always worries me, 'cause I'm gonna,
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.760]   I see people taking pictures with their tablets.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.760]   Those three things are improvements.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.200]   I don't think seventh-day generation
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.600]   until it makes a big difference.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.200]   - Stacey, what are you, what's your computer
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.520]   on the road now?
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.880]   - Oh, I'm a MacBook Air on the road at home.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.120]   I need to update it.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:28.960]   - Well, did you consider--
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.080]   - Stay tuned, for example, probably update this year.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.400]   - No, 'cause I'm a content creator
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.440]   and I don't wanna deal with it.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.240]   - Yeah, that's out, that's, I mean, truthfully,
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.000]   I don't use a Pixelbook as my main computer.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.360]   I use it back. - No, I can't.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.600]   And I hate that, actually, I should say this,
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.960]   because y'all are smart.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.800]   I don't like the MacBook Pro keyboard.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.280]   I don't like it. - Yeah, it's, yeah.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.640]   - Yeah. - So I'm gonna, very soon,
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.600]   I'm gonna have to, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.840]   - Yeah. - I've gotta find a new computer.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.640]   - You and a lot of Apple lovers.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.640]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.960]   I mean, I'm fine going back to--
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.160]   - Follow the lights, and they'll say, "Come to Chrome."
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.040]   I think the creator problems were there,
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.800]   but I do believe the power of these machines,
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.760]   they're gonna solve that soon.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.200]   - But I, you know, I have to edit a video,
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.360]   I have to edit a podcast. - That's what I'm saying.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.760]   I think you're gonna be able to,
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.240]   with as much memories you get in this thing,
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.520]   with the power of it, you know,
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.680]   we've debated on the show before
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.120]   whether you could ever do that virtually.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.280]   I mean, I was to say over the network,
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.040]   but I think we'll get there.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.760]   - I might mention as long as we're talking about screens
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.560]   that Display Mate tweeted,
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.400]   we haven't seen the report yet, it's coming out Monday,
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.920]   that the Google Pixel 3 XL OLED display
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.480]   is the highest A+ rating
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.560]   and a Display Mate best smartphone display.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:39.400]   - Whoa.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:43.800]   - Take that Apple fan, boys.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.360]   - But that's good news.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:49.720]   I mean, even, look, people like DSL Mark and Display Mate,
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.960]   every time something new comes out,
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.400]   seem to have, "Oh, this is the best for you've ever seen."
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.200]   But even if it's not the best screen ever,
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.880]   if it's better than the Pixel 2,
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.000]   I think that's really good news,
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.760]   'cause that was the one complaint people had
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.800]   about the Pixel 2 XL in particular,
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.960]   that OLED screen.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.600]   Home Hub, seven inch display.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.680]   Did they, why did Google explain to you?
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.840]   Why did they make it so small, Kevin?
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.880]   - Well, they kind of,
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.680]   I don't know that they really explain that.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.680]   My take on it is that they wanted to simplify the smart home
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:27.960]   and have a kind of very focused device just for that.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:31.120]   And that's different from the larger smart displays.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.040]   Like I have the 10 inch Lenovo smart display
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:37.520]   and that is fantastic for content consumption as well.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.320]   And I don't think they really wanted to get into
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.240]   splitting the functionality of this too too much.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.560]   - Okay.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.640]   In fact, it has an analog clock on it.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.480]   It might be a series.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.000]   - That's the only thing that mine does.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:49.840]   It's a clock.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.960]   It's a very expensive clock.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:55.040]   - It also keeps the price down, $149.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.480]   So it's not much more than the famous seven inch
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.560]   entry tablet that we all loved so much
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.480]   that Google slowed some years ago.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.320]   - God, I missed it.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.800]   - I think it's a kind of akin to the Amazon Echo Spot.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.240]   Only it's much more functional with the larger screen.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.080]   - Right.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.360]   - Yeah, the round screen on the spot kind of hinders it
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.200]   a little bit.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.040]   'Cause nothing--
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.360]   - I think it was like a cool design, but still a little weird.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.280]   - Yeah.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.600]   Yeah, I would actually put this in my closet
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.560]   where my spot is.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.400]   That would be reasonable.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.360]   My spot is basically my alarm clock
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.960]   with some voice additional stuff.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.800]   - Yeah, this is--
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:27.640]   - I thought it was really interesting.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.200]   Google made a point of saying no camera.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.520]   - Oh, that's the Lisa point.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.000]   - No camera on this.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.560]   - I don't like Facebook's--
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.160]   - Face, by the way, I did order Facebook's portal.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.880]   - Oh, why, Lee, I had to act--
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.960]   - Well, 'cause I have to.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:41.800]   - Well, I don't know.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.000]   - And your dear wife pointed out that this required you
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.640]   to reactivate Facebook's--
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.000]   - It was extremely frustrating.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.000]   - Dude, don't know, send it back right now.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:54.840]   - No.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:55.680]   (laughing)
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.240]   - This is, well, I may end up sending it back.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.920]   I had to order two.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.720]   This is the Facebook.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.360]   This is such a tone deaf product from Facebook,
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.360]   which is facing all these privacy concerns.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.920]   This thing has a camera built in
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.200]   that follows you automatically.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.360]   Oh, sure, no problem, put that in your house.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.440]   Now Facebook can look around.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.160]   - So, Kevin and I talked briefly about this,
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.560]   but here's the thing.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.280]   Yes, is this a privacy debacle?
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.840]   Would people be excited about this?
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.160]   No, but Facebook, they've kind of been focused
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.400]   so much, remember their web,
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.280]   and then they switched to mobile.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:33.680]   And now they're kind of entering this world
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.920]   with digital assistants,
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.400]   and we're trying not to look at screens as much.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.440]   Yes, there is a screen component there.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.120]   But how do you spend time with your community
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.280]   if you don't call them on some weird communication device,
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.120]   right?
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.240]   If you're not looking at a screen all the time.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.800]   So they have to have some play here.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:56.280]   It's just unfortunate that they're Facebook.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.840]   - Well, it doesn't have Facebook on it.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.480]   It's the other weird thing.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.440]   You can't use it to browse Facebook.
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.280]   - Oh, you're kidding.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.040]   - Oh, that's very limited.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.320]   - It's a weird product.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.520]   But--
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.240]   - This is Facebook's equivalent of the Amazon phone.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:16.480]   - It's basically a video phone.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.640]   It's like the AT&T video phone that they showed
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.000]   at the 1965 World's Fair.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.920]   - Yeah, I think this is,
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.680]   you'll, they'll have sold two to you
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.720]   and maybe two to every other major publication out there
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:28.880]   that has to review gadgets,
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.480]   and they'll be like, yes, we've sold 500 devices.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.480]   - Private by design section here.
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.920]   Apparently it means that you could,
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.640]   there's a clip you could put over the camera, that's it.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.080]   That's by design.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.240]   You can disable the camera.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.440]   Oh, and by the way, Facebook does not listen to you
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.960]   or keep the contents of your portal video calls.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.360]   - Uh-huh.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.760]   It has Amazon's Echo built in, not Jarvis.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.200]   I thought they should have put Jarvis in it, right?
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.040]   - Yeah.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.840]   - But I guess the Amazon Echo,
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.000]   this is why I'm buying it because I wanna read--
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:58.920]   - Jarvis didn't scale.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.480]   - I want to get Jarvis didn't scale.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.000]   It's the user of one.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.320]   I wanna be able to read stories to my children
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.920]   and be the little pig or be the wolf.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.640]   And apparently when you're reading the story,
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.160]   it puts a little wolf face on you
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.120]   when you do the wolf's life.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.640]   - Oh, I see the story time one more time.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.960]   Is there audio on this?
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.680]   We don't really wanna hear it if there is.
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:27.480]   Yeah, that's story time.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.680]   So, no, I ordered it.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.800]   Remember, when I order buy stuff, even like cookware,
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.720]   I'm not buying it as a private citizen.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.720]   I'm buying it for Twitch.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:40.400]   So then don't you need a Rodey robot?
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.240]   No!
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:43.840]   That's exactly my point.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.360]   I have to buy technology stuff.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.200]   - How about it?
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.040]   - It's a red-maker.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.400]   - It's not technology.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.960]   - Oh, what do you mean?
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.640]   - There are seven different AI innovations
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.240]   in that Rodey maker.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.800]   It's a very impressive robot.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.320]   - Stacey Higabotham, you are the devil.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.160]   - I am.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.400]   - Maybe I'll buy the Rodey thing.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.920]   (laughing)
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.520]   - Hey, you know what's good on Rodeys?
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.360]   - What?
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.680]   - K so.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.000]   - Oh!
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.040]   - You guys are trying to kill me.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.560]   You just want me to have a heart attack.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.760]   I know, I know.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.840]   I could tell.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.680]   - They're healthy.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.520]   Rodeys are very healthy.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:19.640]   - There's nothing healthy about a Rodey.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.440]   It's not deep-fed fried or anything.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.520]   - It's got lots of butter on it.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.360]   - No, you don't have to.
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.600]   You don't come out with butter.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.640]   - Well, there's oil in there.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.760]   How much, it goes through the oil pretty quick, I betcha.
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.320]   - Oh, you.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.760]   (laughing)
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.360]   - Twitch needs to watch the carbs.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.440]   And I say that not as a private citizen.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:44.240]   So that's Facebook's competitor to the Google Home Hub.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.720]   $349 for the 15-inch display.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.960]   290, but you buy two, you save a hundred bucks.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.560]   - Just like the Rodey robot.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.400]   You can get a discount from buying Mother One.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.240]   - Yeah.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.080]   Can you?
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.360]   Yeah, I look up by eight robots.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.520]   So back to the home.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.280]   (laughing)
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.240]   This doesn't have a camera.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.640]   That's how we got to this.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:06.040]   Which I thought was really smart of Google.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.840]   This is not of Google calling device.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.840]   This is a, this is like an Echo Show kind of, right?
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.800]   - Yeah, you could do a call on it,
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.960]   but obviously the other person will not see you.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:19.920]   You'll just see them.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.960]   So you could do a call if you know anybody on.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.600]   - Does it work with non-Google smart home products
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.760]   like say My Ring Doorbell?
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.560]   I presume it does.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.840]   I would hope it does.
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:34.040]   - The new software or the--
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.160]   - Yeah, 'cause I know it works great
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.040]   with the nest on the home.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.760]   - Oh yeah, anything that works with Google.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:44.920]   Now I don't know if Ring actually has an integration
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.960]   with Google Home because that is now owned by Amazon.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.040]   - Right.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.520]   - Now Arlo, it will show my Arlo cameras.
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.360]   - No, okay, good.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.200]   So that's the key.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:58.800]   - But you'll have to actually ask it to show the Arlo
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:02.200]   whereas the nest integration just obviously works.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.600]   Yeah, it just shows up, right?
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.000]   Google Photos also tightly integrated.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.280]   It becomes a photo frame.
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:11.080]   It's funny how the photo frame is now once again
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.360]   in a live category.
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.200]   - Yeah.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.240]   - Okay, we mock that, but my in-laws love that.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.080]   - Sure they do, sure they do.
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:19.920]   - So I'm like, yeah.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.720]   - And so did the Chinese government.
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.520]   - Paranoid.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:26.520]   - Paranoid.
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.720]   So just from journalist to point of view,
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:34.720]   I got three really talented quality journalists here.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.560]   All three of you.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.920]   Did Bloomberg Business Week screw up?
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:44.720]   - I, okay.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.480]   - We're talking about, for those of you who are saying,
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.800]   what is he talking about?
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.080]   On Thursday, Bloomberg Business Week put out a story
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:55.080]   about Super Micro motherboards that had been hardware hacked
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.920]   by Chinese spies to include a special chip on it
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.000]   that looked about the size of a grain of rice
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.280]   that looked like a normal support chip
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:05.480]   but actually phoned home, Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley,
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.160]   the authors of the article claimed they had 17 anonymous
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:12.640]   sources, both in Apple, Amazon and the federal government
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.920]   that said yes, there was this chip, Amazon discovered it
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.160]   when they were doing due diligence
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.320]   before they bought the elemental technologies.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:24.080]   We use an elemental, but so does the Department of Defense
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.440]   elementals are used for drones.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:29.720]   They're used in the Pentagon, they're used by the Mormon
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.760]   church, it'd be an excellent device to place, you know,
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.600]   spy chip on.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:40.560]   Then the next day, massive denials from every company involved
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.360]   saying that never happened.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.600]   It's wrong and misinformed, said Apple.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:51.880]   I'll tell you what I think.
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.440]   I think it's not important whether it was Super Micro or not.
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.520]   And by the way, there is a corroborating story also
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:59.040]   from these authors, the next day or the day,
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:04.040]   or I guess it was Sunday, saying that a security expert
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:09.040]   named Appleboom had discovered a similar chip
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.000]   on a Super Micro motherboard destined for a US telecom.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.160]   But Appleboom did not deny it, but what he says is really
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.800]   the real point is this is happening all the time.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.320]   You can't control the supply chain.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.400]   Sometimes it happens in the factory, more often it happens
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.400]   in the process of mailing the motherboards
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.880]   that the US does it just as much as every other government
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:34.520]   does it, it happens all the time it's been going on for years.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:39.520]   And we even years ago, we reported on this on security now,
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:44.280]   modified ethernet chip was found on a motherboard
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.160]   that was phoning home.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.480]   So that's the bottom line and whether the details
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.760]   of this are accurate or not, nobody denies that this happens,
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:56.560]   it's a problem and that these companies absolutely
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:00.440]   don't want you to talk about it because it's bad for business
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.180]   for everybody.
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:07.180]   But did Bloomberg business week screw this up?
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:10.000]   - Well, Stacy, you were starting to say something.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.480]   (sighs)
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.640]   - Si.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.280]   - No, I can't imagine the Bloomberg.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.280]   - 17 sources.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.320]   - Would have, it is possible they didn't see the whole story.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:24.240]   It is also possible that our government is telling people
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:28.160]   like I tend to believe that Bloomberg thought they were right.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.000]   Right?
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.800]   - Well, I know they thought they were right.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.640]   - But I mean--
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.520]   - This is a prestigious--
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.480]   - But I mean, people do screw things up,
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.760]   but it feels like this isn't a screw of so much as this is.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.160]   I can see the back half of the elephant
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.000]   and I'm calling it a rhinoceros.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.480]   And then everyone's like,
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.120]   "No, no rhinoceros is here."
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.120]   Is what it feels like.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:49.960]   - Right.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.200]   - So-- - You've reached out?
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.800]   - I mean, what do you tell your students about this one?
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.200]   - I don't know 'cause I think we need more--
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.880]   - Presumably, I mean, I'm going only from
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.880]   what I've learned about journalism from the post,
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:12.480]   but presumably these two reporters, 17 sources,
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:17.920]   that's a lot of sources, a lot of people said they're anonymous.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.520]   I don't find that a problem at all.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:22.240]   That's normal operating procedure.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:23.240]   - Unfortunately, but yes.
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.240]   - Especially with national security issues
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:28.160]   because you're not gonna go on the record with this.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.080]   Seven, if it were two, if it were three,
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.560]   I would say, oh, maybe they were being played
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.560]   by the National Intelligence Agencies
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.160]   who probably have a vested, I know our administration
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:40.240]   has a vested interest in deprecating Chinese manufacturers,
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.720]   so maybe that was, but if 17, some of them from Amazon,
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:48.200]   some of them from Apple, that's an awfully large number.
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.840]   Presumably these two guys don't just get to put that
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.560]   on the magazine, by the way, on the cover of the magazine,
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:56.200]   that there's an editor and an editor and a boss
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:57.760]   and a publisher, all of whom say, okay, well,
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.600]   who are the sources?
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:02.720]   Let me see your notes who are doing some verification, right?
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:03.720]   They're not doing it publicly.
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.720]   - The former editor, the economist,
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:07.520]   is the chief of all content of Bloomberg.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:10.200]   - So that, these are quality people
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.680]   and Bloomberg's standing behind it.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:14.760]   They're not putting the reporters out hanging them out.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.760]   - It's just weird that the 17 sources
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:19.480]   versus the vehement denials from those same companies.
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:20.680]   - That's the hard thing to explain.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.520]   - It is.
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:24.360]   - And the question, on Mac Break Weekly, of course,
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.800]   the Mac guys, Andy and Aco said, oh, come on.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.120]   Apple's not gonna lie.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.440]   Here's a question.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.480]   - Apple is the king of the artful denial,
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.080]   but these are actually not artful.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.000]   - These were not artful.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.720]   They were unequivocal.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:42.000]   Is there SEC or some sort of regulatory issue
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.840]   if a publicly held company lies about something like this?
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:46.000]   - Well, unless your point is there,
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.240]   is that they were, would they follow
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.520]   the orders of government to lie?
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:53.280]   - They said even we have not been told to lie.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.120]   - But--
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.160]   - Well, but that's like the true of Fight Club.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.880]   And I guess if the SEC, well, first of all,
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.120]   the SEC already knows.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.800]   But if somebody went after them, let's say,
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.200]   shareholder lawsuit, they would say, oh, judge,
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.960]   let's go in your chambers and I wanna just tell you something.
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.760]   And they show them the national security letter
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.520]   that says you may not and under any circumstances--
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.880]   - Right. - Reveal this.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.960]   And the judge says, okay, I'm gonna dismiss
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.360]   out of hand, I can't tell you why.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:22.960]   There will be more, I mean, we're not done.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.640]   If this happened, there will be more.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.680]   - I think the interesting thing you said, Leo,
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.160]   is whether it could happen someplace else along the chain.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.400]   - It doesn't, yes, that's the point.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.720]   It doesn't matter really. - That's really interesting.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.800]   - Super micro is taking a huge bath.
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:34.640]   - Yes.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.360]   - But it doesn't matter if Super Micro knew
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:39.080]   or didn't know or did it in the factory.
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.200]   This thing happened, these things happen all the time.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:43.360]   - Isn't there physical proof that somebody has
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.360]   of this little tiny chip?
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.960]   There's a picture of the tiny thing on the finger.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.640]   - Okay, so, whoa, hold on.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.480]   Yes.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.800]   So you would have to have physical proof of the chip.
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:52.920]   Bloomberg doesn't have it.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.560]   That picture was an illustration.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.360]   - Yes, in fact, the one guy on the record in the story
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.120]   said, I gave him that chip.
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.520]   Fitzpatrick said, that's a picture I sent them,
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.680]   they reused.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.760]   It wasn't the chip we found, it was just an example.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.000]   - Right, so they don't have the chip
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.960]   somewhere someone has the chip if there is a chip.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.360]   And the idea, so let's talk about what this means
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.200]   from a macro perspective, 'cause this is a big deal.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:22.240]   And this is a supply chain that we,
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:25.560]   to get something equivalent, we would have to look for
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:29.400]   the, like how we brought car manufacturing back to the US
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:32.880]   and the like Japanese car manufacturing to the US
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.320]   from in like the 80s and 90s,
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.400]   because we have outsourced so much of this production,
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:40.760]   we don't have the capabilities.
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.440]   I mean, I remember going through a packaging plan,
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:46.240]   which is how, which puts a lot of these components
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.520]   on a board and packages it up for servers
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.040]   and that sort of thing.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.960]   That shut down like 18 years ago.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.960]   So, you know, we can't just bring this back.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:01.440]   And this is an easy thing to sort of infiltrate.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.280]   These are contractors, subcontractors come into this world.
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:08.240]   It is not, it is not secret.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:11.600]   So, putting a component like this on a board,
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:17.240]   it's possible, it's theoretically possible.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.000]   - It's more than possible, it's already happening.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.200]   And everybody knows it's happening,
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.480]   everybody's acknowledged it's happening.
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:25.600]   Even Brian Krebs says back 10 years ago
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:28.120]   when I was a reporter from the Washington Post,
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.760]   I heard from an extremely well-placed source
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.440]   at One Chinese Tech Company,
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.600]   was on the United States blocked entity list
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.400]   because they sold a custom hardware component
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:37.800]   for many internet enabled printers.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.080]   It secretly made a copy of every document
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.360]   or image sent to the printer
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.120]   and forwarded it to the Chinese government.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.880]   That was 10 years ago.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.680]   We know this happens, there have been many stories.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.040]   We also know these stories are oftentimes quashed
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:54.320]   and that everybody involved from the US government
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.440]   to these companies doesn't want these stories
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.920]   to become well-known.
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.840]   Bruce, I mean, Brian says in his article,
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.240]   supply chain security is the whole enchilada,
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.080]   but no one's willing to pay for it.
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.080]   That we have literally, as you said, Stacey,
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.240]   given up on manufacturing in the United States.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.120]   - Is that what blockchain has been to fix?
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:14.960]   - I'm joking.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:18.440]   - Blockchain, like it or not, he does this in italics.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.960]   The vast majority of electronics are made in China
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.880]   and this is unlikely to change anytime soon.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.000]   The central issue is we don't have any other choice right now.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.800]   The reason is that by nearly all accounts
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:31.040]   it would be punishingly expensive
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.160]   to replicate that manufacturing process
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.680]   here in the United States.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.520]   - True that.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.560]   - And by the way, it isn't just China.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:42.480]   And a lot of this is not a military espionage,
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.560]   a cyber warfare, a lot of it's industrial espionage.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.440]   - Well, the other question, if we're gonna get paranoid,
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:52.200]   is what does our own government do to our own citizens?
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.680]   - We know the NSA is doing this kind of stuff.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.200]   Edward Snowden revealed it.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.200]   - Right.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:00.800]   - He was the one who talked about that ethernet chip.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.160]   So this isn't new story.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.800]   The only thing really new in this story
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.560]   is the specifics about Super Micro Amazon Apple.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.440]   Maybe they got, I think you might be right Stacey,
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.680]   they thought it was a vernoceros
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.840]   when it was really an elephant, but.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:17.400]   - Did you see the IEEE story about the X-ray
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.880]   and optical technology that you could run your boards through
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:22.000]   just to check if there's any unauthorized
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.080]   or deviations from the design?
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.240]   I thought that was kind of cool.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:26.320]   - Chipworks does that.
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:29.880]   - Chipworks takes things apart.
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:31.480]   - This is the X-ray too.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.640]   - Okay, maybe.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.640]   I mean, I'm sure you would X-ray it, but.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:39.600]   - So anyway, good.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.600]   I wanted to bring that up.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.840]   That isn't the biggest story by any means here.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.880]   We've already done the, the.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.960]   - I think it actually, it is.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.560]   - Well, it's a huge story for journalists
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.240]   and it's a huge story in general for us.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.760]   - But there's a certain story for us.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.280]   - And you know what it is.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:58.680]   And actually, let's start with the Wall Street Journal.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.320]   Sworn Enemy of Google.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.160]   - That true.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:06.480]   - Who wrote an article that really misstated the case.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:10.560]   Google exposed user data, feared repercussions
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.200]   of disclosing the public.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.720]   They opted not to disclose to its users its discovery
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.600]   of a bug that gave outside developers access
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.780]   to private data, it found no evidence of misuse.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:24.520]   The story is that last spring,
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:28.640]   Google discovered that the Google+ API could be misused.
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:30.560]   To read everything in your profile
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.960]   and including the things that you marked private.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.120]   So I immediately went to my Google+ profile
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.360]   and there's no credit cards numbers in there.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.000]   It's not, it doesn't have your other Google data in there.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.440]   It's your name address, jobs you worked at.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.200]   There were only two things I had marked private
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.680]   and that one was my personal email address
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.920]   and one was my personal phone number.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.920]   And if somebody got that,
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.360]   I don't think it's the end of the world.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:54.200]   How about you?
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:55.600]   Do you have anything in there, Jeff?
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.840]   - I make nothing private.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:57.840]   - Yeah.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.320]   - Oh, maybe that's where all those spam calls are coming from.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.160]   - Well, maybe.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:07.280]   Google did know about it back in the spring
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:10.400]   and fixed the bug.
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.600]   Actually, we should now go to the Google Project Strobe Post.
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:18.440]   Fixed the bug, didn't tell anybody about it
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.920]   because to the best of their knowledge,
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.640]   which is imperfect 'cause they've been deleting logs
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.120]   every two weeks, it was never used.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:30.120]   No information was exfiltrated and since it had been fixed,
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.200]   they didn't feel like there was anything to say about it.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.680]   - And said that a bit indelicently,
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.400]   like, "Oh, we don't need a bother."
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.360]   - Yeah.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.680]   Then they said something would really surprise me.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.640]   So as a result, we're closing Google+,
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:48.520]   which finding number one of Project Strobe,
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.680]   which by the way, Project Strobe's interesting.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:53.440]   It's a, what they call a root and branch review
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.600]   of third party developer access to Google account
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.080]   and Android device data and of our philosophy
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.520]   around app data access.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.800]   So that was the problem.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.720]   Finding one, there are significant challenges
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:06.300]   in creating and maintaining a successful Google+ product
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:08.320]   that makes consumers expectations.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.920]   So action one, we're shutting down Google+,
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:14.360]   - I just visioned the Sundar said, "Is that still alive?"
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.720]   - What, we are doing that?
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.760]   - Yeah, he thought that Gundrocha, Vic took it with him.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.080]   (laughing)
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.640]   Didn't Vic take that with him?
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.160]   - So they're not shutting it down to August of next year.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.120]   However, of next year.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.120]   - Oh, wow.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.200]   - Also, I went ahead and did the export of all my data.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.760]   - I have to be honest, every time I go Google+,
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:39.400]   there's so much porno on it that I just kind of stopped.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.240]   - Stuff that I wrote.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.320]   - Oh, no, no.
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.160]   (laughing)
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:44.800]   - That's a Trey Radcliffe wrote a farewell.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.240]   So did Lauren Weinstein.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.160]   - Lauren Weinstein, who was a genius at Google+?
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:49.800]   - They were the last ones left there.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.560]   - One's left there.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:54.480]   But even on Lauren Weinstein's post about his farewell
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.200]   to Google+, the first comment was sex, sex, sex,
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.240]   and a link to a sex site.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.160]   It's like, it's obviously--
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:05.160]   - Somebody rubbed my nose properly in a post
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.920]   when I said, sometime ago, on Twitter,
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:10.480]   no New York Times, it's not a ghost town.
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:11.920]   Do I look like a ghost?
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.000]   I'm there.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.280]   - Oh, so much for that.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:19.440]   - Why are they advertising so much porn if no one's there?
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.280]   (laughing)
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.120]   - Good point.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.320]   - Because spammers do it 'cause it's easy and cheap.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.160]   - It's free.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.000]   - Yeah.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:25.840]   - Oh.
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:26.920]   - But what is the zone inside?
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:27.760]   - It's gotten to the handle of that.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:29.880]   - It's got a great defender at Google+.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:30.720]   - That's a good question.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.880]   I don't know what Mike said.
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:36.000]   Trey Radcliffe wrote a, 'cause I think actually,
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.160]   if anyone was the number one recipient
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.880]   of benefit from Google+,
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.040]   Trey made his career--
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:41.880]   - He did.
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.680]   - He made the service too.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:44.560]   - And he made the service.
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:45.520]   He's a great photographer.
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:47.240]   He was the number one followed photographer
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.800]   in Google+ with eight and a half million followers.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.880]   He wrote post on Monday,
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:57.720]   what I would have done if I were designing Google+
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.000]   which I didn't read because who cares.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:00.840]   But--
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:01.680]   (laughing)
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.720]   - I mean, I've heard a lot of people including Mike Yellgen.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.800]   And I think you, Jeff, talk about what Google+ should have done.
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:09.000]   They didn't do any of it.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.440]   Trey was a huge fan of Google+.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.600]   He thinks that sharing photos
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:21.400]   could have been the saving grace of Google+.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.800]   - Like Flickr?
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:23.840]   - Yeah, like Flickr.
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:26.000]   That did so well for Yahoo.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.040]   - So Mike, I have a few from his page.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.480]   One is, social networking is dead.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.880]   It's dead, I tell you poor Mike.
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:35.360]   He loves Google+.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.560]   The best thing about Google+
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.840]   has always been its ability to attract great users, right?
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:41.000]   From the start, the unlimited post size,
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.400]   user moderation policy and comment centrism,
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.760]   favorite substantive posting and commenting
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:48.960]   and the people who want to have real conversations.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.320]   But I'm losing Google+
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.880]   but I don't wanna lose you, says Mike,
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:53.880]   and says where to find them.
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.160]   - And that's what everybody's doing.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.000]   - And then another post--
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.760]   - They call them the plus-perer.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.120]   - Google+ diaspora.
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:00.640]   - Google+ diaspora.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.200]   - Mike argues Google is the new Yahoo.
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.160]   - That I might agree with.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.240]   - Remember Yahoo?
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.080]   - Yeah.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.880]   - 20 years ago, Yahoo.com got more traffic than any site
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.160]   on the internet but it failed to evolve
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.720]   in place of evolution or innovation.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.120]   Yahoo simply started buying everything
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.520]   with the intention of integrating it
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.720]   but it was unable to integrate anything in a compelling way.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:21.440]   I get the anger and I share Mike's angst
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.440]   but not sure that's true.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.760]   - I follow a ton of photography sites, as you can see.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:28.040]   So my Google+ looks very different from your Google+
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.160]   but it's a great place to put pictures.
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.040]   As you can see, high quality pictures.
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:35.340]   And so it's kind of a shame.
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:38.720]   A lot of this stuff, this is actually tame spam.
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.320]   A lot of this stuff is spam.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:43.480]   But a lot of the comments were spam
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.280]   in order to keep the comments spam out.
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:49.200]   And this is what Mike really wishes Google had done.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.680]   You have to go through your comments
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.920]   and carefully print it all out.
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.600]   And he says they should have followed the Twitter model.
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:33:00.360]   Sorry, it's hard not to laugh.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:04.400]   Yeah, it's sad.
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:07.760]   But that's the Google.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:09.040]   - Do we have taps?
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:10.600]   Can we play taps for Google+,?
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.400]   - That's the changelog right there.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.240]   No more Google+.
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:16.600]   Actually, there's a few.
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:18.200]   We've really been doing the changelog
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.160]   with all of the Google announcements
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.800]   but there are a few other things Google has done some.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.640]   - Do you want the intro?
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.880]   - The Google changelog.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:29.600]   - I didn't know you had it in your pocket.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.920]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:35.760]   Google Photos is doing an update, a considerable update
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:38.120]   to Google Photos including,
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.640]   and I guess this ties to the new phones.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.200]   They talked about some of this at the event.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.320]   So you'll be able to, for instance, adjust the depth,
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.520]   just like you do on a Pixel 3,
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.880]   you'll be able to do that on Google Photos as well.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.720]   That's kind of cool.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.760]   The top shot feature is coming to Google Photos.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.840]   If you post a motion photo, you'll be able to do that as well.
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:03.000]   And I think there's a new checkbox,
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.120]   which I don't see here in this article.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.160]   There's a new checkbox in Google Photos
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:08.280]   that has to do with sharing.
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:12.040]   And I'm trying to remember the details on that.
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:16.880]   See if I can find it.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:18.120]   Nah, I don't see it here.
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:21.640]   What else?
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.240]   Making your connected home even smarter with Google Home
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:26.520]   and Nest, I guess that's the Home Hub.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:29.640]   So does it have Zigbee or Z-Wave or anything like that
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.160]   in this Home Hub?
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.080]   - Nope.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.160]   Nope, just Bluetooth 5.0 and Wi-Fi.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.160]   - Does it have Weave and Thread?
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.200]   - It does not have Thread.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:42.120]   - Well, that's odd, because that's, isn't that a Google thing?
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:45.520]   - Well, it was, and then, well, it was a Tony Fidal Google thing.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.520]   So they developed it under that.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.160]   And my hunches, they're like, that's a little weird.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.720]   Let's just screw that over, no more.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.720]   And Google even runs its own Thread Ready version of Thread.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:00.040]   It's not the official Thread.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:01.520]   - Really? - So yeah,
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.560]   because they invented it and used it ahead of time
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.120]   and put all these radios and software into their gear.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.640]   And then the standard, like, way before the standard came out.
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:11.760]   So when the standard came out, they were like,
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.440]   "We'll adapt it."
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.960]   And the standards people were like, "Yeah, okay, you're Google."
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.680]   We would still love to have you be, you know,
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.520]   work with our stuff.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.840]   So that's how that rolled.
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.640]   And now they're like, abandoned again.
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:28.560]   - The new Home App, I'm sure you're excited about that.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:31.120]   More control at your fingertips and updated Home App,
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.480]   all devices in one view, quick actions.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.560]   - It's a little booty.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.320]   - Yeah. - And as part of this,
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:39.240]   Google, they have these lights, the GE lights,
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:43.440]   that are tied into the Google Hub.
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:46.440]   And that's apparently, you can just plug those lights in
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.840]   or screw them in and they will connect automatically
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:49.840]   to the Hub.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.360]   So that's doing something that both--
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.760]   - Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:56.080]   - HomeKit and Amazon have done in the past,
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:58.080]   or recently, fairly recently,
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.800]   on making it easier to connect stuff.
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.360]   So, yay!
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.080]   - And it can tell you if your lights are on, right?
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:06.080]   If you left some stuff, some things, if they're still on,
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:09.280]   like it can warn you, you can get a notification,
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:12.160]   you left the living room lights on, that kind of thing.
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.600]   - Oh, is that, Kevin? Did you see that?
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.840]   - I didn't say that, are you sure that's not the hunches
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.600]   with-- - Yeah, that sounds like
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:19.800]   Amazon hunches, but--
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.680]   - Oh, maybe that's Amazon, all right.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:25.280]   I get them all confused.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:29.240]   - Amazon did change their Madam A app,
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.840]   so that also happened.
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:33.040]   Everybody's moving, like in lockstep.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:36.560]   - Oh, oh, I'm gonna tell you about an exclusive I had,
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.560]   'cause it relates actually to Google.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.400]   Ta-da!
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:43.760]   This was last week, so I'm just gonna share it.
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:47.400]   Google, or Walmart, is actually saying to
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:51.040]   smart home device makers that wanna sell stuff in Walmart,
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.240]   that they need to support Google Home,
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:57.400]   or they shouldn't be, they won't be listed in the store,
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.280]   so you can't just have a lot of stuff.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.600]   You have to have Google Home as well.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.400]   And they also, if you do support a lot,
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.640]   you should put that on the back of the box,
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.600]   or the side of the box,
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.080]   it should not be the most prominent part of the box.
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:13.960]   So, those are two things that I had heard from
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.880]   many, many, many, many people.
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:18.640]   I had called, they were all anonymous Jeff, so sorry.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.600]   Nobody wants to go up against a Walmart.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:25.320]   So, that was six companies told me that,
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.960]   and then a couple of them actually said that
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:30.160]   Walmart was encouraging them to get off AWS.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:35.160]   So, it sounds like Walmart's pushing to get off AWS.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:38.680]   Because they've actually in the past, like last year,
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.280]   they encouraged a lot of their tech vendors
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.240]   to get off of Amazon Web Services.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.920]   Just because, but then they're a little,
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.160]   it's like competitive, yeah.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:53.160]   It's not it, I mean, they asked people to,
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.200]   they did not demand.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.040]   Just like Microsoft asked you to.
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.400]   (laughs)
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.160]   But I mean, is it the same thing?
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:01.360]   - Nice, if you wouldn't want to happen,
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.520]   it would happen to your nice content.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.680]   (laughs)
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:07.880]   - Nice, you'll do best.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:09.960]   - You can, I can see a reason, like,
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.760]   especially if you wanted somebody,
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:16.040]   I mean, you could encourage people to have
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:18.520]   infrastructure in both spots too.
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.680]   That would be kind of more resilient anyway,
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:23.000]   even though it's harder as an architectural decision,
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.520]   and more expensive.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.800]   So, I don't know.
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.360]   - I remember the one thing,
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:32.120]   and this really comes from the new Google Home Hub.
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:35.720]   Live albums have been added to Google Photos,
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:39.000]   and that means you can check a box next to any album,
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.680]   and it will automatically be updated,
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.760]   and the whole idea is that,
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.080]   then if you're sharing to family and friends on their home hub,
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.840]   they'll get it always up to date.
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.880]   - Yeah, that works with people or pets.
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:52.840]   So like, when I take,
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.360]   I actually have shared photo albums,
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.920]   Norm has a following, apparently.
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:01.640]   And when I add photos, or take photos of Norm,
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:03.560]   those photos will automatically be added
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.760]   to the Google Home Hub Live album.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.440]   So they're kind of using like their search algorithm stuff
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:11.400]   and computer vision to just update your photos
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.560]   on the home hub, on the fly.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.080]   - So you choose the people in the pets
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.360]   you wanna keep track of,
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:18.200]   photos will automatically add photos of them
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.600]   to your album as you take 'em.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.720]   And by the way, the album doesn't require you
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:24.200]   to be shared to a Google Home Hub.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.440]   I could share it to anybody who has Google Photos,
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.720]   and that album would be updated there as well.
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.280]   Live albums, now rolling out in a number of countries
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.520]   on Android, iOS, and the web.
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:38.480]   And that is the Google change log.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.440]   (dramatic music)
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.960]   It was a big week for the change log,
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.440]   if you include all the announcements.
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:47.400]   - That's awesome. - A lot of new products
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.320]   coming out.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:51.640]   Let's see, if we covered everything,
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:52.760]   I'm gonna go back now.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.800]   - I'm gonna be loose.
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:55.880]   - We've been jumping all over the place.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:56.800]   - No, we haven't, actually.
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.400]   - Jumping all over the place.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.280]   Amazon's eliminating monthly bonuses and stock awards
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:05.680]   for warehouse workers after raising wages to $15 an hour.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.960]   You know, Amazon Giveth, Amazon Take It The Way.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:11.040]   Oh, I love the AI recruiting tool
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.040]   that the Amazon was using.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:15.960]   That had a little bit of a bias against women.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.840]   - Jesus, guys, what do you think for one second?
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:19.840]   - They've stopped using it.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:23.720]   Amazon says they were really hoping to...
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:27.920]   This is the Holy Grail, this is according to Reuters.
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:29.320]   Everyone wanted this Holy Grail.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:30.880]   They literally wanted it to be an engine
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.800]   where I'm gonna give you 100 resumes,
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:35.400]   it spits out the top five and we'll hire those.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.720]   By 2015, the company realized its new system
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.520]   was not rating candidates for software developer jobs
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.360]   and other technical posts in a gender neutral way.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:46.640]   And this is something we've seen time and time again.
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:48.600]   When you train these models,
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.520]   you're training with a biases that the material
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:52.600]   that you're training them with has.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.680]   And of course, they're using resumes
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.440]   that were submitted to the company here for a 10 year period
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:59.640]   and most of them came from men.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:04.280]   So as a result, and this is not a surprise,
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:07.560]   Amazon system taught itself that male candidates
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:08.480]   were preferable.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:11.280]   - Oh, it's just like people today.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.840]   - Just like real people.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.000]   AI, just like real people.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.960]   It penalized resumes that included the word women's in them
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.240]   as in women's chess club captain.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:25.880]   It downgraded graduates of two all women colleges.
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:26.720]   - Geez.
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.520]   - Amazon edited the programs to make them neutral
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.960]   to those terms, but they finally disabled,
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:38.000]   disbanded the team and stopped using it because they just--
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.720]   - I'm not an expert at any of this,
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.840]   but it seems you've just gotta do a test
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.040]   of seeing what the outcomes are.
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:44.880]   - Right.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.160]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:48.360]   - Well, but you might even be blind to that.
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:49.400]   You might say-- - That's the problem.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.480]   You share those biases.
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.520]   - But so-- - It's a number.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.880]   - Well, I know that you could say,
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:58.680]   well, the reason it's not giving us an equal representation
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:01.360]   of women is because they're just that aren't that many applying.
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:02.880]   - Just like I'm saying life, yeah.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.200]   - Right, that's the truth.
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:05.040]   - I know.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.560]   - Your result may end up being,
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:09.680]   well, we prefer Ivy League schools, for instance,
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:12.600]   but what you might not seeing as the underlying fact
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.080]   that then prefers men.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:14.920]   - But what I'm saying is--
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:17.520]   - But you're right, if you looked at the raw number--
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.200]   - Or you build in a desired result.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:22.640]   - Yeah. - Which is, no matter what
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:25.640]   the data show, give me a preponderance
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.920]   of women candidates, give me a preponderance
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:30.680]   of people of color, give me a preponderance of this or that,
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.680]   that that's the goal. - That's called affirmative action.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:33.520]   - Yeah.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:36.360]   And there's no law involved here.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.280]   It's the app and you can build that into the goals, yeah.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:39.880]   - You can build affirmative action into it.
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.880]   Amazon scrapped it instead.
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:44.520]   - I wonder if you could make, and this is interesting
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:47.200]   because if we're thinking about doing AI
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.120]   and so many more avenues of life,
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.320]   what if we just become more astute
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:53.960]   about the key metrics that matter, right?
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:56.320]   So your college doesn't really matter
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.240]   and that becomes kind of like letting people
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.840]   like remember when orchestras let people audition
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.200]   behind a curtain.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.560]   So it could become kind of a curtain.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:07.080]   So maybe you do the tech classes
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.800]   or the tech languages you need.
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.160]   And I don't know if that's possible,
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.160]   I'm just trying to think of what--
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.360]   - Well, I think that that's more sophisticated.
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.160]   The problem is what they're doing is dumping,
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:16.400]   they're doing machine learning
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.360]   and they just dump crap in there.
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:19.400]   - And you're absolutely right.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.760]   The smarter, the better way to do it
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:23.400]   may not look as artificial intelligency,
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:24.880]   but that's to think a little bit more about the data.
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.720]   - Well, though, it would be more about the data.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.560]   - It would be cleaning up the data more
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:29.720]   before running it in the model.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:31.200]   - Maybe that's it, yeah, yeah.
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:32.400]   - And you're also looking at the outcomes.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:35.860]   You want to test the outcomes against certain criteria.
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:40.040]   - Here's a product you might be able to buy in a year or so.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:42.800]   Andy Rubin, as you know, was a creator of Android,
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.920]   went to Google, ran Android for Google for many years,
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:48.800]   then left to start a company called Essential.
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.400]   Essential's first phone was a flop, unfortunately.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.040]   They said they were gonna build a home automation hub,
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:58.840]   they've decided to stop work on that,
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:01.840]   and a second phone and focus on a phone
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:05.480]   that I don't know when they're gonna come out with it,
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:08.880]   but his tiny phone has a small screen
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:12.360]   and requires users to interact mainly with voice commands.
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:16.960]   The phone would respond to text messages automatically.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:20.560]   - Doesn't Google kind of already do that?
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:22.760]   - Well, maybe the ideas for the product and book appointments
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:25.360]   are responding emails and text messages on its phone.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.360]   - Oh, right, all that, right.
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.160]   - Users would also be able to make phone calls
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:29.540]   from the plan device.
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:34.160]   - So a portable assistant, maybe that you wear?
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.920]   - Yeah, maybe it isn't a phone.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.360]   Maybe it's not, yeah, that's interesting.
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:41.960]   'Cause what's the SAM lessons?
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:46.280]   - Oh, yes, Viv.
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.120]   - Viv, I think I--
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.560]   - Viv, no, no, that was the one that SAM something bought.
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:53.160]   SAM's is, yeah, here's his humans though.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:54.000]   - Is it?
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:54.840]   - Mostly.
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:55.680]   - Oh, really?
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:56.680]   - That's why it's so expensive.
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:57.920]   (laughing)
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:58.760]   - Oh.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:01.320]   - It's pretty pricey.
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:02.560]   I used it for a little while,
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.960]   and I didn't use it enough to justify it,
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.960]   but it's basically human assistance to it.
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:07.280]   - Oh, okay.
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:10.240]   - Essential raised $300 million,
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:11.560]   'cause of Andy Rubin's name.
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:12.560]   - Yeah.
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:15.240]   - So they have, I guess they have some left over.
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:17.280]   So they're gonna work on this thing.
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:19.680]   - Just like how Elliot was gonna do the podcast service
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.760]   and ended up abandoning that for Twitter.
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:22.640]   - Yeah, it could be.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:23.880]   He's a smart guy. - Oh, yeah.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:26.360]   - They put the Home Speaker Project on hold.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:29.560]   According to Mark German,
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:32.360]   who had this story in Bloomberg technology,
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.920]   they've already lost key engineers working on the project
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.240]   and missed disagreements over the prospects
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:40.000]   for launching such an ambitious device.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.480]   So back to the drawing board.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:45.680]   - I wonder if this is a pivot on the ambient OS,
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.000]   which is what Ruby was touting.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.560]   That was gonna be a smart home platform.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.880]   Or he's just something completely different.
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:56.800]   - Maybe that's exactly right.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.680]   It's just a different form factor.
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:45:59.520]   - Yeah.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:03.720]   - According to German and a person familiar
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.600]   with the development of this phone,
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:09.280]   a first prototype should be finished by the end of the year
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.080]   and the person said the company might show off
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:14.720]   the device to industry partners as soon as January at CES.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:18.320]   Well, that'd be interesting.
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:21.040]   - I'd be interested in such a thing, wouldn't you?
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:22.320]   - I mean, yeah.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.440]   - I don't, I mean, this is the--
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:25.480]   - I hate being a one of those. - What is this device?
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.240]   It's not a phone so much anymore.
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:28.080]   - No.
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:29.520]   - I think the big screen,
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:31.000]   and the trend is towards bigger screens,
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.800]   because you're doing things that are screening on it.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:36.800]   But what if you had a separate device that wasn't screening?
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:40.480]   What if it was just handling communications tasks?
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.720]   - And if we made a movie about it.
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:43.640]   - Called her.
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.640]   - And if you fell in love with it,
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.000]   and then it ran off to join the other AIs.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.720]   And you were stuck with your high water pants
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:53.040]   and your bad mustache.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.080]   What about that?
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:57.520]   Jeff's looking at us funny.
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.200]   You must have missed that movie.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:00.520]   - Dude, it's on Netflix now.
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:02.200]   - It's an awesome movie.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.120]   - It's depressing.
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:06.960]   - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, right, okay.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:07.880]   - It's a little depressing.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:08.720]   - Yes it is.
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:09.560]   - Isn't it?
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:10.560]   I think Stacy, you were the one who was told me
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.200]   who was just depressing.
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.200]   - I think it's just depressing
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.480]   'cause everyone's told lonely.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:16.320]   - Yeah.
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:18.440]   I think it's depressing 'cause they all wear their pants up here.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:19.280]   - Yeah.
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:21.200]   - Yeah, that is awesome.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.280]   I'm not gonna lie.
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:23.320]   (laughs)
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:24.760]   - Is that the future?
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:28.440]   Did you see there was one guy from the future
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.720]   during the Google event?
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:33.840]   - Do we have, I don't know if we have a video of that.
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:34.680]   - Shiggy?
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.040]   Was Shiggy there?
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:37.480]   - This is the new Shiggy.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:38.320]   This is Google.
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:39.160]   - Oh my.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:40.000]   - I wanna be the new Shiggy.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:40.840]   Shiggy.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:41.680]   - Shiggy.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:42.520]   - I wanna be that.
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:46.840]   - Let me see if I can find the maid with Google.
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:50.600]   - Is this the playground thing they showed?
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:53.880]   - Let me see if I can find the video.
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.520]   I'm gonna have to really run through this fast to find him
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:57.680]   'cause he only was a,
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:58.520]   it was nice.
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.000]   - There's a lot of different people up on stage.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.240]   Sundar was not there at any point, right?
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:06.880]   No, this is just their promotional video.
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.160]   - Was it a presenter or was it?
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:09.000]   - It was a presenter.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.480]   I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought it up.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.880]   No, I'm just embarrassed.
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:12.720]   - Now we're all curious.
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:14.680]   - No, I'm just embarrassed.
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:16.320]   It was the guy who was wearing a suit
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.960]   that looked like it was made out of the same material,
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:20.360]   the same fabric,
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:24.480]   but it had a vest that had a very short little window
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:28.160]   and then the suit was charcoal pepper
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.200]   and his hair was--
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:32.520]   - Oh, is it, is it Mark Spades?
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:33.680]   - It was Mark Spades.
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:34.520]   - Was it Marzani?
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:35.360]   - Mark Spades, I think it was.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:37.280]   - Mark Spades is the best dressed man
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:38.760]   in the internet of things.
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:39.600]   - Oh, why?
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:42.640]   - Yes, no, that's that's dammy with faint praise,
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.480]   I suspect.
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:44.320]   - It was Mark Spades.
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:45.160]   - You're right.
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:46.200]   - No, she's correct.
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:47.040]   - I'm serious.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.360]   - So he's known for being kind of a fashion play.
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:51.400]   - Oh yeah, he is a fashionista, I love it.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.200]   - Well, he turns and you can see his vest
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:56.320]   'cause it was not a normal vest.
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:57.160]   - It is not.
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:59.120]   - No, he's got a style, man.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.560]   - So he must have, he's the head of connected,
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:04.680]   he was the head of connected home platform at Logitech
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:07.760]   and he's now product leader, smart speakers at Google.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:08.600]   - I like that.
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:09.880]   - He's one of the smartest people out there.
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:11.880]   - Oh yeah, I liked him.
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:14.200]   But I just thought, if you were gonna make a movie
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:17.040]   about the future, that's how people would dress, for sure.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:18.800]   - I was in--
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:19.800]   - I wondered when you started talking,
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.440]   when you mentioned the charcoal ground,
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.600]   I was like, oh, I've seen this suit.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:23.440]   I know exactly what this is.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.320]   - It's a nice suit.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:25.240]   - Yeah, I think that's--
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.160]   - Is he wearing his wrist?
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.560]   - Actually, you're the one who tweeted
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:30.160]   the best dressed person in IOT.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:32.760]   Here's your tweet, he retweeted you.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:35.120]   (laughing)
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:36.560]   - Well, there you go.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:37.400]   - Yep.
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.920]   - I forget what color shoes he had Stacy,
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:42.080]   but they were very fashionable, yes.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:43.280]   - They're light and no socks.
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:45.120]   - And then the future, no one wore socks
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:46.840]   'cause that's superfluous.
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:48.520]   - I'm just like a necktie.
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:51.240]   - Well, yeah, if you're gonna wear your pants that high,
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:53.360]   ankle cut pants, no socks.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:55.280]   - I don't want that suit.
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:56.120]   - Yeah.
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:58.000]   - That is really hot. - Somehow Leo.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.160]   - You don't think I'd look good, isn't it?
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:00.000]   - I'm afraid we're--
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:00.840]   - You think he invents surf,
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:01.840]   goes shopping for vests?
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:02.680]   - I'd look like--
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:03.520]   - Because who else does this?
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:04.360]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:06.080]   - I bought him a very invest in you.
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:06.920]   - I love vests.
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.000]   - This goes all the way up.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.280]   - I want vests to come back.
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.640]   I have a vested interest in vests.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:13.640]   - That was below you.
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:16.000]   (laughing)
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.280]   - This 20-year-old is, according to motherboard,
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:21.560]   archiving thousands of flash banner ads
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:22.920]   from the early 2000s.
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:24.240]   - He triggered me.
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:26.080]   (laughing)
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:29.640]   - So you can relive the old days of online casinos
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.040]   and lower my bills ads.
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.320]   He's got four gigabytes of them so far.
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:34.920]   - Slap the monkey.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.560]   - Oh yeah, remember that?
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.400]   - Yeah.
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:38.240]   (laughing)
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.800]   - Oh boy.
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:41.120]   - Now please are hideous.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:42.720]   - These are so bad.
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:43.720]   - They were hideous.
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:44.560]   - I gotta find--
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.960]   - Guys, I have to give you,
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:47.560]   I have to run in like 20 minutes.
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:48.440]   - Do you have to get, we're done.
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.160]   I'm just filling right now.
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:51.000]   (laughing)
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.640]   I wanna make you anxious.
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:53.600]   - I'm not anxious.
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:54.800]   I'm giving myself time,
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:55.760]   but I'm just letting it out.
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:57.200]   - One of the problems this kid's gonna have
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.720]   is that in a couple of years,
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:00.680]   Adobe says there won't be any more flash,
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:01.840]   so he's gonna have to figure out a way
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:02.680]   to play these back.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.040]   Tyler Grant-- - It's a target.
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:07.360]   - He has archived over 66,000 banner ads
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:08.520]   from the early 2000s.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.000]   - Wow.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:10.840]   - Where's the site?
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:12.120]   I gotta go to the site.
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:14.420]   Now I wanna check that out.
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:17.040]   I hate articles that don't--
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:18.800]   - Don't link to the stuff, I know.
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:20.960]   - This stuff, it's really cool.
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:22.720]   - I hate articles without date lines.
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:23.960]   - All articles should have a date line.
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:25.880]   - All articles, yeah.
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:28.360]   - Not a date line, I'm sorry about date.
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:31.360]   - Grant has a paste bin page.
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.280]   What?
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:33.320]   - Of the internet archives,
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:34.760]   we pull some off the archive.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:37.360]   - I was wondering where to--
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:41.040]   - Fortunately, I don't think I have flash on my computer.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.440]   - No, fortunately you don't have flash.
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.280]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:46.320]   Fortunately, I don't have flash on my computer.
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:49.200]   Netflix is actually buying a studio in Albuquerque
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:51.600]   with nine sound stages.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:52.600]   - I can't imagine the stars,
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:54.280]   I mean Albuquerque is a lovely city, I love it,
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:55.720]   but I can't imagine the stars wanna go there.
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.840]   - They've already been producing stuff there.
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.560]   Breaking Bad was in Albuquerque.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:01.160]   - Well, but the story was too.
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:02.000]   - Yeah.
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.960]   - There's actually, there's studios all over the country
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:08.560]   and weird places, believe it or not.
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:11.800]   - A lot of it to avoid the Los Angeles unions.
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:12.640]   - Yeah.
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.120]   - Nobody, for instance, wants,
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:17.280]   I've heard from many actors and others,
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:20.560]   wants to go to Vancouver again,
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.960]   but that everything is shot in Vancouver
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:23.800]   'cause they don't have the same--
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:25.360]   - Oh, but in Vancouver so nice.
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:27.480]   - I love Vancouver, I was, you know.
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:28.840]   - Like Albuquerque is, like--
[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:30.920]   - So the company's called ABQ.
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:32.400]   - It's a friend of you.
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:34.240]   - It will create a thousand new jobs
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:37.440]   and the billion dollars in the Albuquerque economy.
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:40.520]   They shot the Avengers there and Sicario.
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:44.200]   So a couple of movies have already been shot there.
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:49.920]   Netflix is deciding to do their own thing,
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:50.960]   make their own.
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:56.960]   And they like New Mexico, it's dry, it's a dry heat.
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:58.080]   - It is.
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:52:59.240]   It's a little cool here today,
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:01.200]   I always thought that some of them was always hot.
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:03.960]   - Yeah, no, we're having, well, winter is coming.
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:05.200]   - Oh, is that what you call it?
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:06.360]   - Yeah.
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:08.000]   Actually, speaking of archivists,
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.280]   and I'm trying to get this guy,
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:11.120]   we'd love to get this guy on the show,
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:15.440]   Mark Graham is the guy who runs the Wayback Machine.
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:18.000]   He did a podcast in which he revealed
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:21.560]   some interesting information about,
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:23.960]   oh, actually this was at the ONA conference.
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:24.800]   - I know him, he's a good guy.
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:26.120]   - Mark Graham, yeah.
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:26.960]   He was the specific.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:28.200]   - 'Cause he did a whole bunch of archiving
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:29.300]   of television news.
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:34.820]   - He said, let me see if I can find the numbers.
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:40.920]   1.6 million news programs.
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:41.760]   - Yeah, what's what he's doing?
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:42.600]   - Wow.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:46.440]   They've got 78s, 200,000 78s recently,
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:49.000]   donated by the Boston Library,
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.520]   an extensive video game collection.
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:55.200]   The internet archive adds four petabytes
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:58.640]   of information a year, four million gigabytes a year.
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:03.680]   Their total Wayback Machine content is 22 petabytes.
[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:05.760]   - Where do they get the money to do this?
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:08.800]   - Brewster Cale funded it initially,
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:11.080]   and I think they get people to help them out.
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:11.920]   - It's amazing.
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:12.760]   - 'Cause I never hear the begging,
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:14.160]   but it's really valuable.
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:15.360]   - Oh, it's, well.
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:17.880]   Maybe all those flash ads are actually ads on there.
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:19.440]   (laughing)
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:20.280]   - The mission statement,
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:22.720]   internet archive has been around for 22 years.
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:24.960]   The mission statement is simple,
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:27.040]   universal access to all knowledge.
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.720]   The problem of course was that the internet,
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:31.680]   as great as it was, is disappearing, right?
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:35.040]   As job, you know, flash ads disappear and so forth.
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:37.320]   So Graham says, we try to get everything,
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:38.640]   but it's challenging, embeds,
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.080]   JavaScript's, interactive apps.
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:41.160]   We can't get some of this stuff,
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:42.880]   but we're working on it.
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:46.000]   You can boot an old version of Mac OS,
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.120]   a system seven on it.
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:50.320]   You can run the hypercard on it.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:52.240]   It's really important.
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:53.800]   Really important. - It is, it's too warped.
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:54.640]   - Yeah.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:56.760]   He says, I love Google,
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:58.960]   but their job isn't to make copies of the homepage
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:54:59.920]   every 10 minutes.
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:02.120]   Ours is.
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:05.640]   - I hit use bookstores everywhere I go now,
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:07.520]   'cause I'm doing research. - Trying to search.
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:12.280]   - And so I'm down in Menlo Park,
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.400]   there's a use bookstore there,
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:15.920]   and I got a book that was all about bookshelves.
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:19.880]   Not only are the books disappearing, but the shelves are on this.
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:20.920]   - The shelves are on this.
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:22.880]   (laughing)
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:24.720]   - I love books and bookshelves.
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:26.480]   All I ever wanted was a book like that.
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:28.040]   - Big deal, a lot of the original libraries
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.440]   had chained books.
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.960]   - Yeah, I remember that.
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:31.800]   - Yeah. - You know, at that old,
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:33.360]   it was like the 1400, 1500s.
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:36.560]   - Well, I went to Yale.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:40.360]   And at the Bineke Rare Book Library,
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:43.240]   well, they do have in fact a Gutenberg Bible.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:46.880]   They also have a map of Vinland
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:49.720]   that was used to demonstrate that the Vikings
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:51.240]   came to America before Columbus did it,
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:53.200]   and here we are in Columbus Day Week,
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:55.160]   or Indigenous Peoples' days,
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:57.100]   as it's widely referred to now.
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:01.640]   This map is now finally being analyzed,
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.520]   because it really is just a hoax.
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:06.200]   Some undergraduate Torah page out of a manuscript
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:09.400]   and drew this map, but nobody's ever admitted to it,
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.920]   and it's always been one of the jewels
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.400]   of the Bineke collection.
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:14.360]   (laughing)
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:17.160]   It's finally getting, it's the same people
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:19.240]   who analyzed the shroud of Turin.
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:25.320]   Are finally gonna take a look at the Vinland map.
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:29.620]   Came to be a 15th century map of the world.
[01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:37.260]   Okay, that is not my pick of the week.
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:38.100]   Could have been.
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:40.540]   (chuckling)
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:43.700]   But I think it's time for our picks of the week,
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:45.460]   and since Jeff is in studio,
[01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:47.820]   I think we should let him do his number first.
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:49.020]   Okay, let me see which one I wanted to use.
[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:50.100]   Pick a number, any number.
[01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:53.100]   (chuckling)
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:56.940]   So there is an underground food economy on Facebook.
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:57.780]   What?
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:58.940]   (chuckling)
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:00.540]   Man, I wanna join Facebook now.
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:03.580]   Yeah, you can buy Rody here.
[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:05.940]   (chuckling)
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:06.900]   Can you buy stuff?
[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:08.500]   So you can buy foods, these are things that are,
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:11.180]   it's not, the health department would go after you.
[01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:12.500]   You're not supposed to do this,
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:14.660]   but grandma is selling her brownies.
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:15.780]   This is becoming a real problem,
[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:17.940]   'cause a lot of people are starting to cook in their kitchens
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:20.820]   and sell this stuff via these various delivery services.
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:23.620]   And it's not regulated by the health department or anything,
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.500]   but it's grandma.
[01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:26.540]   Yeah.
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:28.300]   She wouldn't poison you.
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:29.140]   So I liked that one.
[01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:30.340]   I thought that was an interesting one.
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:32.420]   Did you wanna give us the address
[01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:34.260]   if people still use Facebook?
[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:35.420]   It's just you go, it's very useful.
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:37.940]   People are selling various things locally on Facebook.
[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:41.660]   You haven't done a disclaimer, all show.
[01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:42.500]   Facebook.
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:43.500]   Oh, Facebook, yes.
[01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:46.460]   So I raised money for the Craig Newmark Graduate School
[01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:47.580]   of Journalism from Facebook.
[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:49.380]   I have no official ties to Facebook.
[01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:51.060]   I received no money from Facebook personally,
[01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:53.380]   and I'm independent of Facebook, end of disclosure.
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:54.860]   (laughing)
[01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:57.580]   Kevin Tofel, do you have a pick for us?
[01:57:57.580 --> 01:57:59.420]   I do, I'm actually excited.
[01:57:59.420 --> 01:58:03.540]   I have not used this yet, but I have just received
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:06.980]   the Enki Vector Robot.
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:08.540]   Oh, the new one.
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:09.380]   Oh, so cute.
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:10.420]   The new one, so cute.
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:11.260]   Yeah.
[01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:15.340]   This has all of its smarts on board.
[01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:19.260]   There's a Qualcomm 200 level chip in there and WiFi.
[01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:21.820]   So it's got computer vision, it can recognize your face,
[01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:23.140]   it can speak.
[01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:25.860]   They are adding, I just found out today,
[01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:29.220]   they're working on their Alexa integration,
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:31.140]   which I'm surprised they're doing that
[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:32.700]   'cause they won't gonna do that.
[01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:36.700]   But I got this 'cause it's cute, it's fun, it's autonomous.
[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:37.860]   So you set it up with a phone app
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:41.620]   and then it just does its thing and reacts to you by voice.
[01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:43.780]   Well, just like my echo is right now.
[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:44.900]   And there's what it looks like.
[01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:47.780]   Pics are people, help develop the facial features
[01:58:47.780 --> 01:58:50.820]   and the little animations.
[01:58:50.820 --> 01:58:52.500]   It's got personality.
[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:55.180]   See, he's shaking around his head and whatnot.
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:58.500]   So that is the robot smart enough to take over the world,
[01:58:58.500 --> 01:58:59.900]   but too nice too.
[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:00.740]   (laughing)
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:02.220]   That's a good slogan.
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:04.460]   Yeah, the other reason I got this,
[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:06.140]   and I got it on Kickstarter, even though,
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:07.140]   Anki didn't need to do that
[01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:09.140]   'cause they're an established company.
[01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:12.620]   It was $199 Kickstarter and it's $249 store.
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:14.180]   Oh, I want this robot.
[01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.500]   Yeah, it's small.
[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:17.020]   I mean, obviously it's very small.
[01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:19.740]   It's a dark or smarter version of the Cosmos.
[01:59:19.740 --> 01:59:20.580]   (laughing)
[01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:21.420]   Correct.
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:23.980]   Where do I get the baby drone?
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:24.820]   Yeah.
[01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:27.580]   It's not that robot, that's I love that one.
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:30.220]   Or the Boston Dynamics dog.
[01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:32.460]   So this is, their ad has all these robots
[01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:34.660]   that you maybe don't want in the house.
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:36.300]   Right, right.
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:38.820]   You'll even go back and just charge and cable and all that.
[01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:42.100]   So the other reason Leo that I got this was because
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:44.020]   the SDK is coming out in December
[01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:46.300]   and it's all Python based.
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.220]   Yay, Python!
[01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:49.820]   Yes, yes.
[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:50.940]   So I'm excited for that.
[01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:53.500]   And then if you guys can share the photo
[01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:56.540]   that I have on there,
[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:59.780]   this is my bonus Pixel 3 XL.
[01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:00.660]   Portrait mode.
[02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:01.940]   Wow, is that good?
[02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:02.780]   Look at that.
[02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:05.780]   But that is using the new color pop
[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:07.660]   that they have that works with portrait mode.
[02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:11.060]   So that's why you see the gold on the robot
[02:00:11.060 --> 02:00:14.100]   and everything else is kind of grayish, gray scale.
[02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:16.060]   Oh, that was automatic.
[02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:17.020]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:19.220]   Yeah, the color pop picks something to make color,
[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:21.380]   the foreground and then everything else is black
[02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:22.220]   and white in the background.
[02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:23.060]   That's not a bad idea.
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:24.780]   And you can, yep.
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:26.900]   It's actually a filter,
[02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:30.460]   but what you do is you then tap on the screen
[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:32.620]   and pick what you want, which color you want to pop.
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:36.340]   So I could have changed that to have the white box be a color
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:38.460]   because I guess white's a color really absence.
[02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:41.380]   So yeah, so it's a very cool piece of.
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:42.700]   I'm getting it just for the camera.
[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:43.780]   I'm going to do this right now.
[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:45.340]   I'm going to say this right now.
[02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:46.620]   I did an experiment last trip.
[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:48.340]   I only brought one camera and one lens
[02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:49.820]   and it was a manual focus lens.
[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:53.140]   This next trip, I'm only going to bring a Pixel 3.
[02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:53.980]   Where's the next trip?
[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:55.860]   Instead of all the fancy camera gear
[02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:57.140]   that I've spent so much money.
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:57.980]   Where are you going?
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:00:58.820]   When is the next trip?
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:00.460]   Hawaii in the spring.
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:01.420]   Oh, why?
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:03.380]   But I don't know where or anything else
[02:01:03.380 --> 02:01:05.100]   'cause Lisa's surprising me.
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:07.060]   She says, I'll tell you when you get on the plane.
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:08.260]   Oh.
[02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:09.100]   Oh.
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:10.740]   So Kevin, before you were off you,
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:15.420]   the last question I have to ask you as the expert is,
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:16.940]   all right, so if I had $1,000
[02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:19.540]   bearing the hole in the pocket, which do I buy?
[02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:21.060]   The phone or the slate?
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:22.460]   Oh, that's a good question.
[02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:25.660]   Would you keep your Pixelbook in either way?
[02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:27.140]   You're keeping everything.
[02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:28.700]   What phone are you using now, Pixel 2?
[02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:29.700]   2 XL.
[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:31.620]   So you have the most recent,
[02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:33.300]   you're only a year old in either one of those.
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:34.140]   Yeah.
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:35.540]   That's interesting.
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:37.220]   I don't know, maybe I'm biased, Jeff.
[02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:38.700]   I probably would go for the slate
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:41.300]   'cause I just would.
[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:43.500]   I mean, you're getting a full Pixelbook experience
[02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:45.180]   but it's lighter, more mobile.
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:46.380]   You are Dr. Chromebook.
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:48.220]   Yeah, but--
[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:49.740]   I'm Chromebook guy too.
[02:01:49.740 --> 02:01:51.100]   Yeah, I think that maybe--
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:52.420]   It's not gonna fix any problems
[02:01:52.420 --> 02:01:54.180]   that you have with the Pixelbook, so to speak,
[02:01:54.180 --> 02:01:55.900]   but I think it's--
[02:01:55.900 --> 02:01:57.780]   Well, of course it's gonna do that soon, yes.
[02:01:57.780 --> 02:01:59.180]   Yeah.
[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:03.180]   Yeah, 'cause the Pixel 2 to the 3 sure it's nice,
[02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:04.540]   but is it $1,000 nice?
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:05.380]   I don't know.
[02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:07.900]   I guess you could say the same with the slate, so.
[02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:08.740]   Dr. Kofel.
[02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:11.260]   You'll be sorry when you see my pictures from Hawaii.
[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:13.380]   Jeff, you could buy the Rotimatic.
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:14.700]   (laughing)
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:17.420]   Wait, there's a third choice.
[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:19.860]   What's buying door number three?
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:22.500]   It's the Rotimatic.
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:27.020]   Make your own red non-Hatses with the Rotimatic.
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:28.100]   A 3D Rotie printer.
[02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:28.940]   How about the--
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:30.500]   Even counts your roties.
[02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:32.740]   Even counts your roties.
[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:36.740]   And now, Stacey Higginbotham and her pick of the week.
[02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:40.100]   Okay, oh man, you guys, I'm gonna stop traveling for a while,
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:42.900]   so it's very exciting, but until I get to my home,
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:44.380]   I'm back in Appland.
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:45.580]   I actually have two things.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:49.260]   I'll give you two things, one that is kind of like fun.
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:52.060]   I saw this at the Smart Kitchen Summit.
[02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:53.100]   It is a app.
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:54.700]   It's only on iOS right now.
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:59.300]   It's called Suggestic, S-U-G-G-E-S-T-I-C.
[02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:01.820]   And what it does is it helps you,
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:04.700]   you pick a nutrition plan like vegan or vegetarian,
[02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:07.620]   or in my case, I've got someone in my family
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:10.140]   with the Lo-Fod Map diet, which is freakin esoteric,
[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:11.380]   or Whole30.
[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:14.100]   You tell it that, and then it is,
[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:17.060]   it gives you recipes that meet that need,
[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:20.940]   but also if you're near restaurants that have things
[02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:23.220]   that you can eat, it will pop up when you're at a restaurant
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:25.940]   and tell you what you can eat in those places.
[02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:28.540]   So some of it is paid, some of it is free,
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:33.540]   some of the food preferences you might have to pay for,
[02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:36.220]   but you should check it out,
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:37.740]   see if you can use the free site,
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:41.540]   and if you like it, level up to the paid.
[02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:44.580]   But I thought because I have people in my life
[02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:46.460]   that are on freaky diets,
[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:48.940]   this was actually kind of a really neat service.
[02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:51.340]   So, Sejestic.
[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:53.740]   Sejestic.com.
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:55.420]   So what's the diet, FOD?
[02:03:55.420 --> 02:03:58.100]   Oh, FOD Maps.
[02:03:58.100 --> 02:03:58.940]   FOD Maps.
[02:03:58.940 --> 02:03:59.780]   Just don't even.
[02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:00.940]   Don't even get started.
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:01.780]   Don't even.
[02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:02.980]   All right.
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:04.660]   So, oh, and here's my other thing,
[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:05.660]   because I just watched it,
[02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:08.060]   because again, traveling all the time,
[02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:10.700]   this is so old, it's from 2009,
[02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:12.620]   but if you have stars,
[02:04:12.620 --> 02:04:15.740]   party down is an amazing two season show.
[02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:16.580]   That is all.
[02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:17.420]   I never heard of it.
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:20.300]   It is hilarious,
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:22.700]   and I cannot believe I hadn't seen it.
[02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:26.180]   A group of actors moved to Los Angeles to make it big,
[02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:29.780]   but end up working as caterers.
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:31.420]   Just trust me on this one,
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:33.940]   it is like a rest of development money.
[02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:37.340]   Oh, it's got the good place girl.
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:38.820]   Yes, it does.

[02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:45.180]   It has Jane Lynch's in it.
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:47.220]   Oh, it's great, it's Jane Lynch's in it.
[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:48.060]   Wow.
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:49.540]   It's just gorgeous in it.
[02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:50.660]   And yeah.

[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:52.940]   I've never heard of it.
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:55.300]   I was like, let me check this out.
[02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:56.780]   Done, it's awesome.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:58.500]   Is it okay?
[02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:00.660]   Paul Rudd created it.
[02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:02.300]   It is not for children.
[02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:03.140]   Right.
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:05.900]   For children, 'cause they're partying down.
[02:05:05.900 --> 02:05:08.140]   Wow, Lizzie Kaplan's in it, I love her.
[02:05:08.140 --> 02:05:08.980]   Yeah.
[02:05:08.980 --> 02:05:09.820]   Oh yeah.
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:12.500]   Megan Mullally's in it, I love her.
[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:13.340]   Yeah, I can't.
[02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:14.660]   What a good cast.
[02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:15.660]   Hmm. So.
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:16.500]   Okay.
[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:18.860]   So many episodes, enjoy them all.
[02:05:18.860 --> 02:05:19.700]   Courtesy.
[02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:20.540]   Party down.
[02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:22.180]   Party down.
[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:24.540]   Ed Begley Jr. is in one episode.
[02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:27.340]   Oh yeah, the cameos are worth it.
[02:05:27.340 --> 02:05:29.740]   Steve Goomburgs in one episode.
[02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:30.820]   That was a really good episode.
[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:33.620]   You like Marvel's Mrs. Meisel?
[02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:34.540]   Oh, I love that show.
[02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:36.740]   You know, I didn't really get into it.
[02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:38.900]   I got more angry at it.
[02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:41.140]   I, because I'm like,
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:43.820]   stupid sexist, everybody, girl, girl, girl.
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:45.180]   Yes, but she triumphs.
[02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:46.020]   She triumphs, yeah.
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:49.620]   I get it, but I'm sick of like that.
[02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:51.740]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:53.860]   You know what I thought was
[02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:56.660]   the reason to watch it is the woman who plays.
[02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:57.820]   Oh, she's great.
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:05:58.660]   What's her name?
[02:05:58.660 --> 02:05:59.500]   Is it Rachel Brosnan?
[02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:00.340]   I can't remember her name.
[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:01.340]   Yes, she is really good.
[02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:03.100]   She is a revelation.
[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:05.740]   I think she's gonna be a huge star.
[02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:07.660]   She's just charismatic and good,
[02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:09.980]   and it's really, that's the best part of it.
[02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:11.660]   In fact, that's the reason that shows us success.
[02:06:11.660 --> 02:06:12.500]   Yes, it is.
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:15.020]   That and the period piece of it,
[02:06:15.020 --> 02:06:15.860]   thelessness of it.
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:17.220]   I like gold New York stuff.
[02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:18.060]   Yeah.
[02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:19.540]   New York in the 50s.
[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:21.300]   Well, did you say you have two?
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:22.460]   Did you want to do something besides,
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:24.020]   oh, you did, party down and suggest it.
[02:06:24.020 --> 02:06:24.860]   I did too.
[02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:25.860]   Yeah, 'cause one fell,
[02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:29.300]   'cause a tick from 2009 feels a little cheap.
[02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:31.540]   Yeah, on that airplane, Stacey Haganbasi.
[02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:33.100]   What time is your flight?
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:35.100]   It's like 4.15 or 4.30.
[02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:35.940]   Oh, yeah, I'd be at the gate.
[02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:37.020]   I'm gonna be standing the door by now.
[02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:38.100]   Get to the gate and doing more on it.
[02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:39.540]   Get out of that lounge.

[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:33.340]   I know it's worth the fright of coming over a bridge.

[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:14.060]   We'd had a nice studio audience today thanks to Jeff
[02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:16.540]   and some people who stuck around in André who was visiting
[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:17.860]   from Spain.
