[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.200]   Also, Facebook, the cloud, anything else we want to talk about. So there.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   Our regulars are here, Gina Trapani from SmarterWare.org and think up at Hello, Gina Trapani.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   Hello, I'm here in HD today.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   Thanks to All About Android. So you do All About Android. Now you get a good connection.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   Is that it?
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.600]   I know, I know, that's it. Exactly. Love and All About Android, by the way.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   Yeah, thank you for hosting that with, of course, Jason and Ron Richards.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.400]   And yeah, you look good. We got a special dedicated connection to dedicated hardware and it looks much better.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   We're really happy about that.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   Much, much better. Now I actually have to do it with my hair, as I was saying, in the picture.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   So that's the bad news.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.800]   No, you look great.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.200]   But I do notice a strange object with a Twitfest behind you. I never saw that before.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   Oh, you never saw?
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   Was that so?
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   It was just a little bit.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   It got a couple of times.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   My little smiley face.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   It was just blurry. I didn't know what that was.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   Why do you have a plastic smiley face head? I guess would be the question.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   Is that for weeks?
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   You know, it was just something that had like as a kid, I've had it like almost my whole life.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.600]   It's a coin bank, actually. It's just a yellow smiley face.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   And then, you know, I thought the pheas fit on it perfectly.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   It feels like it's not wanting us.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   Oh, no, it wasn't meant to be creepy at all.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   You don't find the noseless smiley face a little creepy?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   No, you know, it's just like the yellow smiley face, the sort of classic cartoon.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.600]   No, it's not working for us.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.000]   Now, Jeff Jarvis is also here, journalism professor at City University of New York.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   He's at home.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.600]   And apparently he's got a lampshade with the pheas.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   I'm glad the pheas is being put to...
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   It does.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   Such good use.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   That's why we sent you.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.920]   What do we send you at Amazon gift card this year?
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.600]   We figured, eh, we're not sending them anymore garments.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   Oh, we got the awesome Twit mug.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   The mug's.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   That's right.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   We still want to do the lab coats.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   Also with us, we're so glad to have him from searchengineland.com and marketingengineland.com.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   Danny Sullivan is here.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   I don't have a faz.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   I'll have a zis.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   Oh, he's got a, what do they call that?
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   Jane hat.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   Jane hat.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   Wow, where'd you get that?
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   Android hat.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   Comic Con.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   Oh, Comic Con.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   Yeah, I have one.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.840]   Actually, there's a long story about my Jane hat, which I won't...
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.400]   I guess I could do with the brief version.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.240]   It was made for me by Kat, who is a hat and knitting podcast for many years.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.560]   She did a show on how to make a Jane hat, made me one.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.640]   And then when Colleen left to go to Google, I said, "You can have any hat you wanted.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.360]   She took my Jane hat," which was fine.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.600]   And then Kat, then it came back and gave me a new one.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   Excellent.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   So, all on Jane hat number two.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   If I need a faz, clearly.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   Well, I think we could arrange that.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   Fezzorama.com.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   This is the first one.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.080]   Item number one, Jeff Jarvis, demonstrating...
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.520]   I think this is an example of...
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.600]   This is how people know you're in the 1%.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   He bought a Google Pixel, a crawl.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.680]   I almost did.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.680]   I ordered it.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.600]   Oh, then you backed out?
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.400]   Well, here's the story.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.480]   So I'm so trained now when Google comes up with a product.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.480]   If I have any desire for it, I immediately go and try to get in and get them on the right.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.560]   This is going to get away and it's going to be gone.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.600]   Nexus 4, everything before that.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   Chromebook, everything else.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.560]   So you wanted to get it before it sold out.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   So I just...
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.200]   I'm going to get it on the right order and then I'll figure it out.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.640]   I said, "I want to go see it."
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.680]   So I was actually at a conference, I think, last week when this came out.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.040]   And so I came back and on Monday morning in New York, there were only 11 designated best
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.840]   buy stores in the country.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.840]   But have them.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   I go trooping across town to go to the best buy store and go in there and say, "Hi, where's
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.840]   the Chromebooks?"
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.680]   They have them hidden, which is odd.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.080]   Then I say, "Where's the Chromebook?"
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.080]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.840]   Google won't let us put it out unless the Google rep is here.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   What?
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   Wow.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   Where's the Google rep?
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.560]   Oh, we're not sure.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.440]   They don't really tell us when it comes in.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.000]   Usually the answer.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.600]   Google takes out these days.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   Good gig.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.560]   Show up when you want to.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.200]   So I growl and I tweet nationally.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.840]   So then I called downtown to the other of three best buys in town that's supposed to
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   have it.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.800]   And they say, "Oh, no, he was in Sunday."
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.800]   You mean, he's not coming in today?
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.880]   Well, usually maybe Friday, Saturday, Saturday, they were not sure.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.440]   And now you know why Apple, which also had Apple stores in Best Buy's, I guess it was
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.560]   a Comp USA, but now you know why Apple has its own retail presence.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.720]   So then I go back to the office and I'm thinking, "It's a lot of money.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.880]   I'm not so sure.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880]   It is just a browser."
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   So I cancel the wrong.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.680]   Oh, not my usual spite.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.680]   But I cancel it.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.400]   I say, "I'm not thinking about it."
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.680]   I don't want this thing to arrive and have to get rid of it.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.080]   So good news is Biggity Bong points out this Chromebook Pixel will never be out of stock.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080]   That's true.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.880]   Some really good news.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.080]   Well, then I do go back.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.400]   I do go back.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.040]   And I meet a nice band named Roy at the Best Buy, the first four-mission Best Buy when
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.040]   he came in.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.360]   Actually, I actually called that afternoon.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.640]   I said, "Is the Google guy there?"
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.520]   Oh, no, he's running a lunch.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.520]   It does.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.520]   It does.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.520]   It's a movie right here.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.800]   Searching for Google Guy.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.840]   So then I delayed myself considerably with meetings in school, which you can do very easily.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.320]   And wandered back over and Roy was there and I saw the Pixel.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   It is gorgeous.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.320]   It is.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   It's solid.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.640]   It's a beautiful screen.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.400]   It's as fast as can be.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.360]   It's really quite nice and impressive.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.840]   I don't know.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.800]   It's $1,300 to $1,500 for a browser, as they say.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.320]   But I'm using my Chromebook all the time and my Chromebook is my old Samsung is slow
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.040]   and it's kind of plastic-y.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.640]   You would be a good candidate for this if you do.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.840]   I mean, if that has become your, I think it has, your main computer.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840]   Oh, it has.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.960]   And Kevin Marks was at a conference last week and he talked to the people who said that
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.200]   I was the ideal customer for it.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.160]   They decided for you, Jeff.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160]   Yeah, right.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.400]   Bad marketing decision.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.920]   So of course, the ideal customer can't get the damn machine.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.000]   Can't see them in the damn machine.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   So I finally do.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I finally look at it.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.040]   I'm still in the side and I said, "I'm going to talk about it on Twig."
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.600]   So while I'm in the store, I go to Twig to test it.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.200]   And Gina, you didn't have your fine video yet.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.440]   But Leo, you look just marvelous.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.120]   And now I want one.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.360]   The video was amazing.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.880]   Anything that makes me look good.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.880]   It did.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.800]   You're a marvelous.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.320]   And so then Roy, the Google guy is saying, "What's that?"
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.160]   A whole show about Google, really?
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.400]   And so he took a picture of me doing it and all that kind of stuff.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.360]   And so then I get back and then the first time this ever happened, because I've had other
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.840]   issues, a Google PR representative came and said, "Oh, I'm so glad you got the Chromebook."
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.640]   It's actually, no, I didn't.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.120]   And then she just emailed and said, "Would you like a review one?"
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.120]   Yes.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.120]   So I said, "Yes."
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.120]   Good.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.120]   So you'll have that soon.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.200]   I'm still very tempted.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.360]   It is a limited machine.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   It is kind of absurd.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.120]   But I do use it most of the time.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.920]   And it is very solid.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.920]   It's heavier.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.920]   The battery is lighter.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.400]   You know, five hours and six and a half hours.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.720]   Who's the market for this?
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.040]   I think it's cloud user.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.040]   The power cloud user.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.040]   Anybody with a power lock?
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.760]   I think they're going to make something like 200,000 and probably give away 100,000
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.760]   of them in I/O.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.160]   Oh, you think you'll get one in I/O?
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160]   Maybe we should go to I/O.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.160]   It's pretty.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.160]   Gina, you're going I/O, right?
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.160]   I'm sure, Dina, you're going I/O.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.160]   Maybe I'll go this year.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.160]   It would be nice.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160]   I would, it would be worth going I/O for that.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   I don't know.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160]   They'll give the pixel away.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.960]   No, they've given away Chromebooks every year though, haven't they?
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.320]   First we see our 48, the prototype.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.720]   Last year you got the Samsung.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.720]   And the Chrome box.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.720]   And the box.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   And the box.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.800]   I think the Chrome, but I ordered one and it came on Monday.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.960]   Dina, you have one.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   You beat me, Dina.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.560]   So I ordered it kind of as soon as it went online because I...
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.560]   What you got the...
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.880]   With L.D. or without L.D.?
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.880]   No, without.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.880]   Because you can't get them with...
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.840]   But you can't get them with the without.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.200]   But I don't want that because I have a phone and the phone has a hotspot.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   So I don't...
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   I never really understand wanting to then have it in my device.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.680]   Anybody who buys the Pixel should have his own LTE.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.680]   Why have I have two?
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.680]   I think you're missing the point.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.680]   I've got a iPhone and I've got a Nexus.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.680]   Have another.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.680]   Help yourself.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.160]   I think you're missing the point.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.560]   The Pixel is a no-compromised solution.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.560]   Clearly Leo loves it and can't wait to get his hands on a phone.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.560]   No, I don't want one.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.760]   You know what I bought?
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   Same price.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.920]   And you're going to laugh at me.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.280]   This is a Windows 8 notebook from Acer.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.480]   Same price.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480]   Very much the same hardware.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.480]   Touch screen.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.920]   It's 1920 by 1080.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.840]   Not quite as high resolution.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.120]   Beautiful screen.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.120]   And I love it.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.400]   And it's Windows 8.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.840]   But so, Golly, I guess I could turn it into a Chromebook.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   Well, this is the question.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.440]   Somebody said, "No, no, that's not a Chromebook."
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.640]   If I just promised, I will never use anything but Chrome.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.640]   Would that be a Chromebook?
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.640]   Sure.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.640]   That'd be the same thing, right?
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.000]   That's what I took on Twitter.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.240]   I said that if you can't afford the $1,300 Chromebook, good news.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.160]   You can run Chrome virtually on any computer.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.160]   The different things.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   The price.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   Instant phone.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:19.880]   So, yeah, if you want to see how fast this turns on, this is from zero to full in nine
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.880]   seconds.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.160]   The Chromebook boots very fast.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.720]   My MacBooks boot chintas fast.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.360]   My Windows 8 laptop boots, jinta bodice font as well.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.960]   And the touchscreen, actually, the Windows 8 touchscreen has more support than the Chromebook.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:41.720]   The Chromebook, if you want to pinch and screw and take something on screen and make it larger,
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.200]   you can't do that on the Chromebook.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.560]   I can't even change the flag, Danny.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.040]   No, it's weird.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.160]   I've been trying to do it on Windows 8.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.200]   I didn't explore on Windows 8.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   It's great.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   I can zoom in on anything.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.760]   In fact, if you show my screen chat, you see, I can just pinch.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.040]   This is all pinching.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.960]   It's very easy to do all this.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.760]   But I have to use IE when I use Chrome.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.960]   It does a little bit of it, but not this.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.960]   There's a flag.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.960]   There's a flag.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   There's a flag.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.800]   If you do Chrome flag, there's a flag to turn on pinching.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.200]   Oh, let me turn on pinching.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   Touching is definitely.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.440]   I mean, we're going to get a map.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.080]   Once you've used a touchscreen, as I'm sure you have Leo, you realize it's nice being able
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.240]   to interact with your screen.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.320]   I'm sure that the MacBooks are going to get there as well.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:29.360]   The Chromebook, for me, one audience is especially designed for is everybody at Google.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:35.160]   It was remarkable going to Google over the years when first everybody had iPhones, right?
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.880]   Then they got Android.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.880]   It was almost like, "Great.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.960]   Now we can start carrying around our own stuff.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.840]   We don't have to have somebody else's stuff that's out there."
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.560]   Yet you would still go to Google Meetings and the MacBooks would come out everywhere.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.560]   So now they'll have pixels.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.560]   You're going to see Chromebooks everywhere.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.920]   But it's a good machine.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.440]   The biggest surprise for me really was that you couldn't change the screen resolution.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.080]   I have a MacBook retina.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.120]   You could use the full retina quality.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.440]   You can give just a little bit of quality and you can actually see more things on the
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.440]   screen.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.280]   You can go up to 1440 or 1680 by 1050.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.080]   The Chromebook is just locked down to that.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.520]   If you decide you want to see more, you have to do this weird zooming thing with the browser.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.520]   That threw me off.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.040]   Another thing that's intriguing, you can't put Linux on it.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.200]   You can either use crouton to do a virtual Linux on there, right?
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.880]   Or you can just make it a Linux box.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.600]   That's a nice Linux box.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   That is nice.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.840]   I didn't realize that you could do that.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.160]   I have a hard time imagining being an engineer at Google and working on a Chromebook.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.400]   There's a guy in the chat room who claims he's on the Chromebook team and he says,
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.560]   "I understand if you don't want to use it, it's not for everyone."
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.280]   And I guess I understand Google has the resources.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.600]   Hey, the problem with the current Chromebooks is they're basically netbooks.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   They're very low-end.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.600]   They're priced right.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.240]   They're 250 bucks, but they're very low-end.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.240]   Jeff, somebody like Jeff, a classy guy, gets manicures.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.360]   He's well-dressed, lives in a mansion.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.120]   He shouldn't have to use it 250 dollars.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.120]   He's a computer house sale.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.120]   He's very well-dressed.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.040]   He dresses himself at Barney's.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.320]   You shouldn't have to use a cheap notebook.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.400]   So what if you still want to use Chrome OS?
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.560]   Why not have the best hardware?
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.000]   It's not for everyone, but at least--
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Well, here's the thing, Leo.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.160]   Here's the question.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.000]   So fine.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.200]   I could run Chrome on an air.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.000]   It's not a simple machine.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   I've got to deal with updates.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.400]   I've got to deal with other things.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.640]   Well, that's the argument is that it's complex.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640]   It's in Chrome.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.640]   There's security.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.640]   You've got to-- you know, there's icons.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.640]   Yeah, I mean, honestly--
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.520]   Well, I was also-- you end up buying software for the other machines, and there's no software
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.880]   to buy at all for the Chrome.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.880]   So it saves you money.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   Money loaded Mac is too grand.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.880]   Right.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.920]   Well, the time I'm done with the stuff I need, whereas here it is the price of the machine.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.920]   That's it.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   And like, just get crafty.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.720]   I mean, you know, Leo, you sent me a clean Mac mini, which has nothing else.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.720]   It's all done.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.720]   Just for Skype.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.720]   But my Mac book and granted, it's a couple of years old, but it sounds like it's about
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.440]   to take off.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.280]   The fan and the CPU is just because over the years you install stuff and then backups
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.840]   and you've got all these icons, the status bar and things are just kind of running in
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.280]   the background and their updates.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.560]   I mean, machines get crafty even when you're vigilant, which I consider myself to be vigilant.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.320]   So I mean, that's a nice sell about the Chromebook is that it's just--
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.320]   Oh, it's not your right.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.320]   It's the one order.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:36.640]   You know, for me, the big sell on the Chromebook-- and this was the sell that the
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.240]   ad campaign was about, right?
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.640]   Was that it's this really cheap notebook that you could absolutely destroy.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   I mean, do you remember that video clip of them basically destroying--
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.640]   Let your dog use it.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.520]   When you let your dog use it, let your kids like run over it, throw it into the ocean.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.320]   And it didn't matter because all your stuff was in the cloud.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.120]   The idea of this sort of disposable everywhere device and it really didn't matter what happened
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.120]   to it.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.120]   You could buy three of them and whatever.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.880]   So the pixel to me, it just doesn't make sense because it's so expensive.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.480]   The same time, it sounds like it's beautiful hardware.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   I mean, the touchpad sounds amazing.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.840]   Touch screen sounds amazing.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.560]   I've never taken a touch screen laptop seriously until now.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.680]   I know there have been plenty of them out there running Windows, but now I'm like, oh,
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.160]   OK, this makes a little sense.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.200]   And that's just my Google Microsoft bias.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.160]   Here's what I'm going to write to you now.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.000]   Right before the Chromebook was officially announced.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.120]   And by the way, we did have it on the show and said, nah, that's not true.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.720]   We ran it-- it actually was a funny genesis because we did run it uncritically.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.720]   We ran that silly video.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.560]   Then the next week, I said, I apologize.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.040]   You should have never run that video clearly a scam.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.800]   And then the third week, it's out.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.000]   But here's the thing, Gina.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.880]   So I use my Chromebook, right?
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.880]   And you're exactly right.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.880]   $250.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.880]   What the hell?
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.880]   It's amazing.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.880]   It's light.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.880]   It's fun.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.880]   I show it off to people and I'm cool.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.200]   They wouldn't solve the barneys, but otherwise it's good.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:17:00.640]   But then I get addicted enough to it that I do lust after running it on a better machine.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.640]   And that's the problem.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.280]   Because the Chromebook is slow, it's plasticky, it craps out the pages.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.120]   I had to change settings thanks to a wonderful twig reader who taught me how to do it.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   It's not a great experience.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.120]   It's a good experience.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.120]   It's a fine experience.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.120]   It's not a great experience.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.080]   You don't expect it to be $250.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.240]   But then you can have a great experience.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.840]   Now, if this-- you know, the night we can quibble, would a really solid $800 Chromebook
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.840]   be better?
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.120]   Or did they have to throw on the razzle-dazzle screen or something else and it's now worth
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.120]   $1,300?
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.120]   Here's my question.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.120]   Why?
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.120]   Why do they do this?
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.200]   Because all you need is the web, Leo.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.080]   That's what Google has to want to get across.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.160]   All you need is the web and the web can be a premium experience and it can be a premium
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.320]   experience through Chrome and on beautiful hardware.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.840]   I think this is the message that Google wants to get across.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.960]   I have to say, when I've used Chromebook since the CR48 and the first time I was using
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.480]   that, it was like, I can't deal with this machine.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.800]   This latest one that came out, I was able to plug it into my external monitor through
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.440]   DisplayPort and it worked beautifully.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.000]   I was able to sit there and actually compose and write and screenshot and do an entire article
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.600]   that I would have just thought was impossible in the past.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.760]   There are things you still couldn't do.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.000]   I couldn't hand this to my kids on a PlayMinecraft and that rules it out for them as
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.960]   it would rule out any Chromebook.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.520]   But for someone who really loves Chromebook and has really gotten into it, then it makes
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.520]   sense.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.200]   You really like Chromebook and you're like, I'm using this all day long, then paying the
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.760]   premium for that better screen makes sense in the same way that if you're already using
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.760]   a laptop all the time and you're thinking, should I pay the extra for a MacBook retina?
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.760]   Sure, that might make sense with it as well.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   How are you going to use this machine versus the other machines you have?
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.600]   I'll probably use it once a week.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.960]   It'll probably be the machine that I use before I go to sleep or get up in the morning
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.600]   that I have in another room that I open up and take a look at it.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.360]   Although I'm going to give it it.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.640]   It's really a day to a week where I'm going to try to substitute it and use it as my main
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.640]   machine.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.080]   I try to do the same thing with my Windows 8 laptop as well.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.080]   How's that go?
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.080]   Well, see how it goes.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.520]   The Windows 8 laptop, I did a whole thing I wrote out on CNET which disappointed me as
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.520]   I bought it because I wanted to be able to, I got the yoga and I wanted to flip it over
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.080]   so that I could then use it as a tablet, right?
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.080]   This is great.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.320]   This is what I've always wanted, a full-fledged computer that is also a tablet.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.240]   The whole thing I was talking about how I was in line to get boarding my Southwest flight.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.840]   I had everything opened up and out looking.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.080]   I was all in desktop mode and I flipped it open and I got in the line.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.280]   I'm looking around and everybody goes, "Oh my God, what's he doing?
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.280]   What is that?"
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:42.280]   I started to reply to email and everything and there's no on-screen keyboard.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   That's a mistake.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.480]   Mine isn't even a tablet.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.000]   On-screen keyboard keeps popping up in fact.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.320]   You're probably in your intro, modern UI or whatever.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.200]   Look, here I am in desktop.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.080]   In the status bar, there's a keyboard.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.080]   All I have to do is tap it.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.000]   You get that but that's not, think about whenever you're using a natural tablet and
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.760]   you need to do input.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.520]   You don't have to then say, "Oh, you know what?
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.520]   I want the keyboard.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.000]   I got to go tap the keyboard and then have it take up half my screen."
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.600]   You just start tapping and the keyboard comes up naturally.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.040]   I just found in desktop mode that really killed it for me.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.680]   What I will say is even though it's this weird hybrid and I can't wait for Windows 9 when
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.240]   we finally get to where we probably need to be.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.960]   It needs a little polish, yeah.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.080]   The touchscreen aspect, you really understand when you're in Windows 8 that that touchscreen
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.440]   makes sense.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.720]   This was the most, the biggest revelation.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   I'm doing this stuff.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.280]   The Chromebook touchscreen, it's much more of a novelty.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.800]   It's like, "Oh, I can push this and get rid of that.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.600]   Maybe if I'm on Google Maps, I can pinch and zoom, but I can't do it."
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.240]   They don't think they're going to change that pretty rapidly or not.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.440]   Yeah, I'm sure that they will.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:00.560]   Windows itself is clearly ahead in terms of understanding we're going to build a touch
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.080]   oriented, real desktop computer operating system.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.360]   Well, let me put a little context on this because I Microsoft for 10 years sold tablets
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.160]   just like the Yoga that converted and there were laptops and they flip-flopped but they
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.080]   were using XP.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.640]   It wasn't a touch enabled OS.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.920]   It was layered on top just as it is with Chrome OS.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.000]   It was kind of like, "Here, let's slap some touch in there."
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.480]   It was always unsatisfying.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.280]   It wasn't until the iPad came out that touch and the iPhone, I guess, first but then the
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.280]   iPad.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.600]   The touch made any sense.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.760]   I think you have to design the OS from the ground up.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:37.320]   That's why Windows 8 succeeds in touch, where Windows XP, Vista, and it's the successors
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.960]   did not.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.320]   I wonder if they could just slap touch on Chrome OS and suddenly make it a touch.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.320]   I agree with you, Danny.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.920]   As soon as you start playing with a, even just a laptop that has touch, people say, "Oh,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.120]   it's confusing.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.120]   You don't want to touch the screen.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.120]   Yes, you do."
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.080]   As soon as you start doing it, it's just so natural.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.640]   It gives you just a natural way to pinch and zoom and move.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.640]   Did you think that would have been the case, Leo?
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.640]   I didn't.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.480]   Well, and also, but more recently, I didn't think it was the case.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.840]   You got so used to touch with tablets and with touch pads and all that.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.320]   That's what changed our view.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.120]   It's like the famous, probably, apocryphal story of the kid trying to turn the page
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.120]   on the screen.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.120]   That's exactly right.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120]   The TV is conditioned now.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.120]   That's how we are now.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.120]   Well, but also, the original Windows touch was stylus, and that's not a good idea.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.120]   There's...
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.120]   Well, you have a tablet.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.120]   Well, that's true.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.120]   That's true.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.320]   By the way, my note just too died today.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.320]   I couldn't turn it on.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   Oh, no.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.320]   Just died.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.320]   What are you going to get now?
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.320]   The HTC One, I think.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.320]   You're going to wait.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.320]   What do you think about the Samsung 4G?
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.320]   What do you think it's going to be?
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.320]   Mmm, looks good.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.320]   I know.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.320]   It's a good time not to have a phone.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   It really is a good time to have a phone.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.320]   The one is really cool though, looking as well.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:58.320]   I'm still sort of married to the Nexus line, but yeah, a lot of good stuff coming out.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:04.320]   I feel weird because I went from having a Galaxy Note 2 and a MacBook retina in one day
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.320]   to Windows 8 laptop and an iPhone.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.320]   It's a switch.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.040]   I'm a little disoriented.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:17.080]   So your yoga experience just wasn't enough, Danny, to convince you to stick with it.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.120]   Well, no, there's all sorts of things that also come into play.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.720]   One of the biggest issues is there's never knowing when I'm on the desktop or going into
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.120]   metrics that you can do back and forth.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.360]   I'd rather it be one way or the other.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.840]   The other thing is, I mean, I use three external monitors when I'm working, right?
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.920]   So my laptop and I'm running out, look down below, and then I've got my browser here,
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.720]   and I've got something I'm reading over there and something I might be reading on my other
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   mouth.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.040]   You can't see them, but I've seen my monitors.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.360]   And when you go into Windows 8, well, it supports the external monitors.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.800]   It doesn't support the Metro portion of it.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.160]   I can't put things up there.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160]   Really?
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160]   It was kind of freaky and weird.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.360]   And I've actually been thinking about writing another thing about how I've actually found
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:05.360]   now that for a 20-year Windows user having shifted over to the Mac finally last year
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.760]   and giving up on running bootcamp and trying to do everything, it actually feels really
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.080]   natural for me now.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:17.440]   I appreciate that I can do all these things that I'm not in one world or the other and
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.760]   supporting my external monitors really well.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:26.440]   And there's just little things with it, but Windows 8 was not enough to make me want to
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.360]   kind of stick with it and go with it.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.120]   And because the other thing too is, there's so much that is touch oriented that when I
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.400]   get onto the external monitors, it's like you're trying to hover your mouse and get
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.200]   that little start thing to come up because goodness knows we can't have a start button
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   anymore, right?
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.800]   And you're having to do all these things that are really designed more to use your fingers,
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   your touch.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.440]   You know, you want to pull something in from the side, right?
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.120]   And you know how you do that gesture to open up the charge window?
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.520]   And I find that when you're using a mouse and you're looking at an external point, you're
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.520]   really hard.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:05.140]   And so it's not worth the effort for me and not with the external monitors and all the
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.240]   other things that are going with it.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:12.640]   But like I said, when we get to Windows 8.5 or Windows 9, I think that's when we finally
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.800]   get rid of desktop and you have to go all in.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.480]   Maybe it'll be more attractive to me then.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.160]   So we got into this from the Pixel.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.440]   Yeah, it's interesting that Chrome OS led to Windows.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.240]   Well, that's kind of the opposite ends of the spectrum.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.440]   From complexity, minimum complexity.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:38.160]   And I can't, for a laptop, I mean, an iPad is even less complexity, I guess, arguably.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:43.680]   Well, actually, no, I would say in a way, a tablet's more complexity because you think
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.200]   it's like file structure and all that.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   You have apps.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   Just a web.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.040]   Period.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.160]   And how is your experiment?
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.480]   You have been using the Samsung.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.840]   Oh, yeah, I mean, right about this and I haven't.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.720]   I am happy, I'm living entirely in the cloud.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.080]   I've had to go to Windows.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.360]   Like today, I had to go to Windows to create.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.680]   I'm going to India and so I had to create a letter on letterhead, which probably I can
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.120]   do in docs, but I didn't know how and I just had find.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:17.880]   But I swear, I haven't had to go to Windows 2 to Microsoft products at all in the last
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   three months.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.000]   I've lived entirely in the cloud.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.760]   The weaknesses, I would say, when I'm on the Chromebook, it's a little slower.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:35.000]   Docs, I haven't found a way to find a spot that I left off in a really long document.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.960]   So I've had to cut up the next long thing I'm trying to write into pieces.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.840]   I think I told the story that Evernote, because it's not native to the Chromebook, when a
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.320]   page refreshed, it killed all my notes, not fully Evernote's fault, but that's the way
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.320]   it was.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.280]   But generally, no, I found it to be extremely successful and I'm living entirely, not because
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:02.160]   of fanboy reasons because it just kind of became easier in Chrome and Android.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.160]   And that's it.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.160]   That's where I'm looking.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160]   Wow.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   I'm not using any applications of any sort.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.200]   And so the argument about apps being the future and apps being the future, when we talk
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.120]   about tablets, well, I think it's the past when it comes to desktop and laptop.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.760]   And I think that informs some of the thinking about apps when it comes to tablets and phones.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.720]   Yeah, we're going to have some because it's going to be appropriate to the device, but
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.480]   I don't think it's the future at all.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.720]   I think you can do a lot on the browser and the browser is going to be a better place
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.160]   to do most things.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.680]   And it works just fine.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:41.480]   I, Google Docs, I've got to sit down and I'm going to fly a genie out and have a tutorial
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.360]   in terms of rethinking how to organize my world.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.560]   I haven't put it into folders and stuff, so it's as bad as my desktop.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.240]   Yeah, mine is too, actually.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.560]   I'm hyperorganized about those things, but my Google Drive is just kind of a stream, just
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.560]   a stack.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.840]   Oh, you know, I'm trying to be unorganized.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.400]   I've been organizing my drive.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.880]   You know, I've been like putting stuff in folders and I need to do that because if I--
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.920]   now, now, if I buy the Chrome-- the Pixel, I'm going to have a terabyte of storage free
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.920]   for a three-year.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.920]   Right.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.920]   That's another selling point.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.920]   That's a nice selling point.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.480]   I mean, Jeff, you are the target audience for the Pixel, right?
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.360]   This is like power Chromebook users.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.360]   It's literally the target audience.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.360]   It's the one that--
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   It's the one that--
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.360]   If you're in the chat room, don't remind me who was this.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.360]   I believe the sales person is directly heading to him right now to sell it.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.360]   The--
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   Boy.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.360]   I throw up in a kumba.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.360]   What a great point.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.200]   No, but the storage.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   What is it?
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.000]   It's three terabytes of storage for three years?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Or did I screw it up?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.800]   One terabyte for three years.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.400]   When I did my claim, they only gave me two, but it's supposed to be three.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.360]   So Jeff wrote a book called What Would Google Do?
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.280]   Google's actually been saying, "What Would Jeff Buy?"
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.280]   And they found it.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.280]   That's a good deal when you--
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   How much would a terabyte be at Google's existing Google Drive prices?
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.280]   I think that it's $1800.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.280]   This is what it works out.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.280]   So people argue, "Well, it's just cheaper than that."
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.280]   It's a good deal.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.280]   It's free, but I don't use a terabyte.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.280]   I'm just going to use a terabyte.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.280]   Well, I mean, if I uploaded every single thing on my hard drive, I would get close to a terabyte.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.280]   I've got a terabyte backup drive.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.280]   I just don't have any interest in uploading every single thing I've ever--
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.280]   Every photo I've ever taken since 2000 when I got my first digital terabyte.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.280]   Well, I think--
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.280]   How long would it take you?
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.280]   I mean, that's a lot of data.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.280]   It is, but the other issue then-- and you can handle this, Gina-- but the problem is, then
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.280]   you really do want to back it up.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.280]   Google's Google, but I want to back it up.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:36.280]   So I looked today back upify as I think it's $3, I don't know if it's a month or a year per
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:44.280]   user for up to 35 gigs, something like that, of data where you could back up your Google
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.280]   apps account.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.280]   So now we're backing up across clouds.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.280]   You shouldn't have to back up Google Drive.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.280]   Come on, really?
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:30:00.480]   It was a very brief time when I had my-- because I have a set of folders and things that I
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.080]   always want backed up on my computer and then I was having both Google Drive and Microsoft
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.080]   cloud drive or Sky Drive use the same folder.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.080]   And in the end, it was too complicated.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.560]   They didn't play well together using the same set of folders, but yeah, you couldn't
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.560]   do that.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.560]   You could have Microsoft back up your Google one.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.880]   But you know, there's always just like-- you know, look, I trust Google to do better backups
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.640]   than I'm going to do and I trust that their drive is going to be around a lot longer than
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.880]   mine are, but there's always this sort of worry.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.080]   I mean, I'm just big on data liberation.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.480]   I want to be able to get to my data.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:38.480]   I'd like to be spread across a couple of different places, including a drive on my desk.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.280]   And what if something goes wrong?
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.480]   And someone hacks me a count or Google decides to shut it down for some reason that I don't
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   know.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.480]   I don't have any recourse.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.800]   I mean, I have this show.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.560]   I have better recourse than most people do.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.440]   But I just always feel like, oh, that's why I'm not going to upload every photo I've ever
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.360]   taken and just trust that it's always going to be there because you just never know.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.320]   And I just like the idea that I could switch to something else if I wanted to.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:08.320]   I don't see myself doing that because Google's products are great and I trust them.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.800]   I think their security is great, but you never know.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.000]   So what if your account got deleted or hacked?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.080]   I mean, that's more likely not that the drive is going to die, but right.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.080]   Exactly.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.080]   Right.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.880]   It's more that your account is going to get deleted or hacked or shut down for some no
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.880]   reason or whatever.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:28.160]   I mean, we get emails from listeners who have these stories of how they got locked out and
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.560]   they couldn't do anything about it.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.840]   And Matt Hone and happens to be a wired writer, so when he had his whole password thing happen,
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.160]   which wasn't Google's fault, but it happened, he was able to write a feature story about
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.880]   it and get a stuff back, but not everybody has that.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:47.120]   Speaking of which, we were talking about using two step authentication.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.800]   He suggested turning that on.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.400]   You did see that my--
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.400]   It's been busted.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.600]   My qualms about that all along were this--
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.160]   The application specific password.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.480]   So called application specific password, which is not application specific.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:08.080]   And in fact, until Google fixed it, because a security researcher pointed out, you could
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.760]   use it to get into everything anytime.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.720]   So all you have to do is get this low security.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:19.980]   I mean, it's not as secure as my password because it's just all lowercase, alphabetic
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.280]   characters.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.080]   You could get into anything with that, including until Google fixed it, which they did this
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.240]   week.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.560]   You could get into the thing where you changed the security settings.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.560]   I mean, this was your point, Leo, all along.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.840]   Like, back for authentication.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.440]   As soon as it's not two factor, which is not in the case of application specific passwords,
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.440]   right?
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.720]   Because it's just one password, then it holding breaks down.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.520]   And it's not even application specific.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.520]   It's a lie.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.520]   It's not.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.600]   It's a generic password to your entire Google account.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.600]   Twelve lowercase letters.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   Come on.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.640]   Don't we have to kill the password?
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   Yes.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.080]   Yeah, but then people will kill us as they cut off our thumbs.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.400]   And I think Google Two Step works great when it uses authenticator.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.200]   That's when it's really two factor authentication.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   Right.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.440]   Because that's the difference.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.760]   It's not two factors to step because two factor means something you know and something
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.760]   you have.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.360]   In this case, my Google authenticator running on my smartphone.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:19.120]   So to log into my real Google account, I put my password in and then I have to run on
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:24.800]   my smartphone Google authenticator, which gives me a six digit code, one time use code.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   That's good.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   Right.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.720]   Because you know, smartphone apps and all these other things that are using Google don't know
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.640]   anything about that.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.280]   They had to offer this backdoor and I'll miss the back doors, a backdoor.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   Right.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.640]   The back doors as insecure.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.720]   So the resolution here was that Google fix it.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:47.160]   So it is truly application specific that checks the referral or no.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.720]   They just they just meant they just make it so you couldn't use it to access certain
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.200]   critical Google services anymore.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.200]   Okay.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.800]   Like security settings because you know, you could use it until this security researcher
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.960]   pointed this out.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.880]   You could use your application specific password to get into, you know, where you set the cell
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.600]   phone that you use for the backup and the backup email.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.600]   You could change that.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.600]   So a guy gets into your account.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.080]   Now he's got everything because you can't change your bag.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.760]   He could change his security settings and that login anything.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.760]   That was kind of cool.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.760]   I'm glad they fixed that.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.760]   Thank you.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.720]   So, so back to the chair by for one second.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   It just occurred to me.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   Yes, sir.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.720]   That.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.880]   I know it's going to fill up the terabyte real fast.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.880]   Google Glass.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.880]   Yep.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.800]   Oh, now we know video recordings direct to Google.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   Oh, that's why that exact window pictures and videos you and no one else will ever look
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.600]   at again, but they are in the cloud, but they're in your life.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   You're right.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   You're right.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.560]   If you want to have Google Glass, it'll only sync with your Chromebook Pixel.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:53.680]   And you are really you're the one you're the nerd quarter of the 1% of the Google Glass.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.480]   And it's the instant upload of Android.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.480]   Google.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.480]   Right.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.480]   Right.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   The same way.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.480]   Right.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.560]   Didn't you love the tech crunch article that says because of the cost of Google Glass, $1,500,
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.920]   even more than a pixel.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.240]   It will be for at least the first year, it'll be a record of the 1% jet style jet setter
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   lifestyle.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.000]   I'm waiting next next year.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.920]   I am a doffler's era Ted.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.320]   You'll have a classic one.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.120]   You're I am a Ted.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   Yes.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.360]   Did you hear what Sergey said at Ted today?
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.360]   No.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.160]   He said that smartphones are emasculating.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.360]   And that's why we need glass.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.360]   Oh, yes.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   So masculine to wear those.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.960]   No, no, yeah, right.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:34.960]   Dorky glasses.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.800]   Smart phones are emasculating because you're staring out rubbing a featureless piece of
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   glass.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   It was a weird, weird moment.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.560]   That's almost I don't.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.560]   I'm befuddled.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.720]   No, it's from the playbook.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.760]   No, you got to understand the playbook.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.120]   He knows it's stupid.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.960]   He just knows if he says it enough, maybe people will start to believe it.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:58.600]   That's why he and his wife went to the Vanity Fair Oscar party wearing glass.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.760]   The whole goal, they understand the problem is you look like a dork.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.760]   So what do you do?
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.360]   You just it's the big lie.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.360]   You just say, no, you're not a dork.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.360]   It's a dork to use a smartphone.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   Wait, I don't look like a dork right now.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.000]   You look like you're somebody who has one of those weird Google glasses that they can
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   get their hands on.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Right?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Maybe.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Maybe.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I mean, you know that that's pretty awesome.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.080]   But I, you know, I suppose what I thought was interesting.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:25.040]   It was the thing Joshua had done where he talked about going out and wearing them and,
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.640]   you know, in sort of real life.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:32.000]   And there were some references he made to where, you know, you didn't know if people
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.960]   thought you were going to be rude or whatever.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.920]   And that's one thing I wonder is how it's not that people think you're dorky as much
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.080]   as sometimes people just feel like you're being rude when you're looking at your phone
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.000]   or people are being rude when they're looking at phones.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.240]   We're constantly doing that.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.840]   And what does it what does it do to us when we kind of have is it better?
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.280]   Is it better that we'll have this thing?
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   Although, you know, you're looking up in this corner, right?
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.880]   So it's going to be pretty obvious when you're not talking to somebody.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.880]   I don't think you're out.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.880]   We always figured out, right?
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.880]   Oh, I know.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.520]   I mean, it's not going to be a crisis, right?
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.800]   No, we came up with norms.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.800]   We danced with the phone.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.800]   We didn't say a hoy.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   We said hello, right?
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   We figured it out.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   We agreed on everything.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.160]   This is this is a particularly challenging one because you'll have people walking around
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.040]   with devices that could be unbeknownst to you recording your every move all the time.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.360]   Well, actually, oh, there's a cartoon in the rundown.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:26.000]   At the bottom of the of the Google Glass section about just that for for our visually for
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.960]   anybody watching audience.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:34.080]   Although the idea that it's going to be constantly running and I mean, if I remember correctly,
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.720]   I don't know that it has that much on on device storage and it can interact with your phone
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.960]   so that it can be storing out onto your phone, but just phone doesn't have that much storage.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.880]   And then I suppose it can be constantly streaming your video back.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.760]   And if you just paid $1,500 for your Google Glass, I suppose you'd be constantly streaming
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.920]   along that way as well.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.600]   But, you know, I don't think you're going to constantly stream.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.560]   I think you're going to say you're going to say turn it on.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.560]   What's that?
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.320]   I think you're going to say turn it on a certain points.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.880]   I don't think you're going to constantly stream because you're going to be overloaded
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.880]   with that.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.480]   And I think there probably will be some signal that we'll have to put on.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.960]   It's that, you know, the red light equals equals camera recording as someone says in
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.960]   the chat room.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.960]   I think we'll do that.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.720]   But we'll figure out these these norms.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.040]   You know, the other thing is we presume now that it's rude to talk to someone on your
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.920]   phone instead of the person in front of you.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.440]   But I argue who's to say that the person in front of you is any more interesting or
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.360]   any more important than the person on the phone.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.880]   And that's something we have to work out too.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.280]   And young people are working that out.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.280]   Sometimes they say, "I'm sorry.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.280]   This is more important."
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.080]   Just because you're here doesn't mean it.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:42.040]   It's so rude when you're talking to somebody and the phone rings and you say, "Excuse me,"
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.880]   and then you answer the phone that is so rude.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.120]   It was so rude.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   It still is.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.280]   It will always be rude.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.920]   If I'm standing talking to you face to face and somebody says, "Hey Leo," and I go, "Jeff,
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.920]   excuse me.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.920]   I'm going to go talk to this person.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   He looks more interesting."
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.920]   That's rude.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.400]   It will always be rude.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.560]   What makes it different on the phone?
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.560]   Because it's a first call.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.920]   Because if he was the one who said that, you'd go to talk to him.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.600]   You'd say, "Jeff, I don't understand."
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.240]   You could say, "Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.720]   I really apologize.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.760]   I have to take this."
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.080]   But you have to apologize.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.280]   I think instead of when.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:24.960]   If you go back to when we first had phones, but there was a time when getting a phone call
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.240]   was a really special thing, like getting a telegram.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.720]   It was a big deal.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.640]   I don't know that that has ever gone away.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.600]   That somehow, "Oh, there's a call coming in."
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.560]   It's almost like getting a package delivered to your house as opposed to just getting your
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.560]   mail.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.920]   You don't necessarily run out and say, "Oh, the mail's here."
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.840]   The UPS guy's coming and you're like, "Oh."
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.120]   The idea that that phone call is coming in, I guess maybe that's just some remnant of this
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.840]   is important.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:59.200]   To me, what tends to be really rude behavior is that you're with someone and then suddenly
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.080]   you're going off to your phone.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.840]   Not that you're talking to somebody else, somebody else or there's some remnant of it.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.640]   You've literally decided at that point.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.640]   I don't want to look at my phone now.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.680]   Whatever they're doing, this thing probably has something that's more interesting.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:16.840]   I have never done this because I'm going to do what I love is when somebody brings out
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.280]   their phone, that's then the excuse for you to bring out yours.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.880]   I'm happy when they bring out their phone.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.680]   It's the electronic equivalent of a smoking break.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.680]   It really is.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.680]   It is.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.600]   I can't handle human.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.920]   You got to understand.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:36.480]   This all comes with the fact that everybody in this room, probably everybody listening,
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:41.160]   and certainly everybody in Silicon Valley are introverts who don't like people and would
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.600]   far prefer to be interacting with hardware.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.960]   That's why they're in the technology business.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.200]   It's pathological.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.440]   It's not normal.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.320]   It's a pathology.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.720]   It's not something we should celebrate.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.880]   I think if you start making this be the norm of a bunch of people who would far prefer to
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.120]   interact with a machine than a human, bad news.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.400]   It's not a machine.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.120]   You're interacting with other people through the machine.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   That's the point.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.120]   We're figuring this out.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:11.000]   Listen, not very long ago, it would have been rude for you not to respond to someone's
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   letter.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.240]   They sat down, they wrote out the letter, they sent it to you, and you don't respond.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.240]   How rude.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.240]   Right?
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:21.240]   Now it's rude to expect someone to respond to me via your email.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.920]   These things just change.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.040]   But I think that the pathology comes not in that Leo.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.720]   I think in terms of the notion of the machine.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.080]   I think the pathology is with the stream.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.680]   It's with the, "Oh my God, there's something going on.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.960]   I honestly have to see."
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.960]   That's where I feel.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:38.600]   Well isn't that the implication when you do that, that something's more important than
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.080]   the person you're talking to?
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:44.560]   No, no, it's that you're missing something in another world, which is more important than
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.480]   my conversation to you.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.680]   But, Grandpa, you're just a super...
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.120]   Hey, what do you mean, Grandpa?
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.080]   So I missed out this conversation because the chat room was more interesting.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.080]   Oh!
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.080]   Oh!
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.080]   Bravo!
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.080]   Bravo, Gina.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.080]   What?
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:05.280]   I mean, this is just me.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   And I agree with you, Leo.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   I am.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.280]   Look, I'm phone phobic.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.280]   I hate taking voice calls.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   Me too.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.160]   So I generally keep my ring or I don't answer to phone voice calls when they come in.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.720]   But if I get a text, I will glance at it.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:20.120]   And I will do that even if I'm in the presence of someone else because it's kind of an asynchronous
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.120]   thing.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.120]   Like, I can multitask.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.800]   I mean, I try not to, in the middle of a conversation, do a deep dive into my Twitter
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   stream.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   Because it's rude.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   And you know it's rude.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   Because it's rude.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   And yeah, and I agree with you.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.840]   But if I'm in a situation where I'm in a group, a group situation where a few different people
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.720]   are talking and I'm only peripherally in the conversation or if I'm in a lecture where
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.200]   the speaker just hasn't kept my attention, I don't feel like it's that big deal.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.880]   I kind of agree with all of you at the same time, but voice calls.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.640]   Don't, I just don't do them.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.640]   In-between voice calls.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.800]   I started writing a medium collection.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.560]   I have two pieces that is not quite a collection make on redefining rude, right?
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.960]   Which really is this process of rethinking our norms.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.440]   And you're right, it's rude today.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.240]   But if everyone does it and agrees about the way we do it, then it's, then it's not rude.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.240]   That's the whole point.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   You redo it.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.400]   And I will say I love introverts.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:15.000]   I'm in this business because I don't want to talk to anybody.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.040]   And you talk to people all day.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.840]   And yeah, I know, but not face to face.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.640]   And, and I understand being an introvert.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.360]   And I think that that's cool.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.000]   And I think that that's why people get into Silicon Valley.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   They get into technology.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.880]   And that's a lot of what's going on with this Google Glass.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.280]   But I don't know if it's, I mean, don't you think it's already a bad scene that everybody,
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:42.320]   you walk downtown, everybody's Google Glass, Barry and their phone.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.120]   Which is what Prince, right?
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.720]   This is what Britain's trying to say that it will, it will stop a world where people
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.720]   are staring down.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.720]   But it doesn't stop it.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.560]   It just means you're looking there instead of there.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   It doesn't stop it.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.560]   It hides it.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.560]   It hides it.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   Exactly.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.560]   Is that better?
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:03.560]   Well, look, with the head to the side, you can see both at the same time.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.120]   You can see the person that you're talking to.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.600]   And you can also see like, oh, hey, I just got a text message from my, you know, from
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.840]   my wife, for example, or oh, I should turn right here.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.320]   And it doesn't break the conversation or come across as rude at the way that it would
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.200]   if you, if you pulled out your phone and broke eye contact.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.240]   I know, Leo, I see what you're saying.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.600]   It's just enabling people to do it more surreptitiously.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.840]   And of course, this is what would come out of Silicon Valley because it's what we want.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.160]   We, but by the way, did you see the eBay price on a, it was a phony Google Glasses to turn
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.640]   out, but it went well over $15,000.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.120]   That's so I'm wrong.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.120]   Obviously people desperately want glass.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.400]   You know, my mother is upset at the moment because you can't get it.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:50.440]   But I mean, to go back to the emasculating thing, I think that how was it a masculine
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:56.080]   society, and I'll guess and I'll go out on a limb to maybe get more into the mind of what
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.760]   he was perhaps thinking.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:03.880]   But, you know, there is an argument that we would like to have all this knowledge, like
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.080]   we have knowledge in our heads.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.280]   We walk around, we interact with people.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   I see you.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   I think who you are.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.520]   I think about the things that I know about you, what you've been doing, what your interests
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.520]   are.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.800]   Nobody considers that when I interact with another person that I'm consulting my brain
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.680]   is somehow rude or somehow inattentive to them.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.920]   That is what you expect.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.480]   That's what you expect somebody to do.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:30.000]   And if somebody doesn't have a good memory, what was your name again?
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   They're an idiot, right?
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.360]   Or you know, they've been really rude to you when, you know, for whatever reason they
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.600]   just didn't twig on it.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.480]   They didn't pick up on it, right?
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.600]   So we now have this ability to enhance our brains.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.880]   And the way that we've been doing that is when we're on the move to use this phone, you
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.160]   know, we pick up this thing and we're like staring at this thing and poking away at
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.440]   it to try to help us enhance our own head and what's in there to do the things that
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.680]   are already natural to us, right?
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.320]   And this is that kind of enhancement.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.480]   And that's like, you're almost like, I could see what he's saying that you're almost pleading
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.440]   with this phone to give you information.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:04.440]   Can I have this?
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.760]   Can I have that?
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:10.000]   And Google class, I suppose one thing is, first of all, it is getting it closer to being
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.240]   what we're normally doing.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.560]   We're seeing things the way we normally see and we're getting this sort of enhanced
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.560]   vision.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.600]   It doesn't put things up in front of you.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   I used one briefly and I wrote a little piece where I talked about it being like a rear
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.480]   view mirror, you know, when you're driving, you use your rear view mirror.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.640]   And at first, the rear view mirror feels really weird and you're like, I remember never wanting
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.640]   to use it.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.640]   I'll never get used to this.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.680]   And now I can drive and I use that thing all the time.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.760]   It's just part of what I do.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.800]   And I think that that's the idea with glasses that you're going to be able to use this and
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:45.860]   not feel like perhaps you're pleading with your telephone to enhance your brain, to get
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.760]   your brain to do more of what it already does.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:54.320]   And the real step further is, of course, naturally the Google brain implant, which sounds like
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.160]   a joke, but that's where it all goes, right?
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.640]   That's where it all goes to at one point and any of the science fiction novels you want
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   to pick when people read about this, it just gets it back into our head.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.800]   And then all the rudeness starts to go away.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.240]   You meet somebody, the information's coming up.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.720]   You're tapping into all these sorts of things.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.480]   And it probably isn't that you're feeling like you're either being distracted from them
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.840]   or that you're having to plead for the information because the information is just part of what
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   you already do.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.240]   Danny, we're going to take a break.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.800]   Danny, I want you to unplug and plug in your headset because we're getting some crackle
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.800]   out of it.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.000]   And Chad, you can work with him while we take a break and talk about legal zoom.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   How about that?
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   Cool.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.880]   So you can sue me for taking pictures of you with my Google Glass.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.880]   Son of a...
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.880]   Yeah, just don't wear that in the locker room.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.360]   That's all I could say.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.360]   Why would you want to...
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.080]   Legal zoom needs a glass app that'll just be able to activate the NBA.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.880]   Like that was the record.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.840]   I suspect in a year from now when we do our Legal Zoom app, we'll be saying, and now
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.040]   with a new form, don't shoot me, bro.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.400]   Don't glass me, bro.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.400]   Glass-free conversation.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.360]   Ah, this is going to be a glass-free conversation.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.640]   Would you sign here, please?
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.720]   And you can sort of wave your hand and do a sign with your finger.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.200]   It's like in the Sopranos.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.480]   I got to search you for a wire.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.480]   I got to search you for glass, I hope.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.320]   Don't take this personal.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.360]   My lawyers have informed me.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.520]   I shouldn't be speaking to you without searching you for a wire.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.240]   This is going to be good for the feds, though, right?
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.240]   If everybody wears glass, they...
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.400]   Who needs to wear a wire?
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.920]   I can't take these off.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.600]   This is how I can't see...
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.600]   Are you there still?
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.480]   I'm blind without my Google Glass.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.800]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   Not a law firm.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.920]   This is an interesting idea.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:44.080]   LegalZoom was born when some lawyers said, "Wait a minute.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:49.160]   You don't really need to pay a high-priced lawyer for some basic stuff like a will, an
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.840]   LLC, a trademark patent."
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.840]   There are lots of things you could do just by filling out a form, and that's when LegalZoom
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.680]   was born, and I got to tell you.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:04.960]   In the last 12 years, over 2 million Americans have used LegalZoom, me too, for LLCs, wills,
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.920]   trusts, trademarks, and more.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.920]   I can vouch for this.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:15.280]   It's very easy to sit up your LLC with LegalZoom.com, and it's just $99.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.600]   Twits in LLC.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.880]   Now, if you fill out that form and you get to a point where you go, "Yeah, I'd like some
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.880]   legal advice.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.360]   LegalZoom even now has attorneys that you could talk to."
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.480]   Their legal plans are available in most states.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:30.240]   You could search the online profile and unedited customer reviews before you talk to the attorney.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:33.440]   They've got fixed prices that they've set with LegalZoom.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.040]   So if you're going through the form and say, "Gee, should I be a Delaware or California
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.040]   LLC?"
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.000]   This is one of the things I was a question for me.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.960]   You could talk to an attorney at a very affordable price.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.240]   LegalZoom is really brilliant.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:49.720]   If you're a blogger and you have not yet trademarked your blog name, you do it, you need to do
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.560]   it.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:57.000]   Patents even, NDAs, and soon Google Glass disclaimer forms.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.560]   LegalZoom.com, I want you to check it out, start your business, or protect your family.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.920]   You can do wills, trusts too, at LegalZoom.com.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.800]   Now, on the law firm, self-help services at your specific direction, or, and this is new,
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.760]   you can speak to a legal plan attorney to get your questions answered and get ongoing
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.920]   advice at a very affordable price.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:18.360]   To receive a special, thank you for using LegalZoom and giving us credit.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:22.640]   We'll give you 10 bucks back when you use the offer code TWIG at checkout.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.040]   So go to LegalZoom.com, browse around, see what you can do with it, or just keep this
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.640]   in the back of your mind for when you do want to do that trademark.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   OMG Chad.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   Trademark.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   Done.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:37.080]   Isn't it a nice feeling to be able to put the TM next to the OMG Chad?
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:41.560]   Yeah, it takes a lot of weight off of my shoulders just to know that's mine.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:45.480]   We did TWIT, and we did the logo.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.360]   We wanted to make sure that was trademark, so that has a little trademark.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:52.600]   It's really, I think it's, it's, and that's not expensive, it's very, so it wasn't hard,
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.600]   wasn't it?
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   No, no, not at all.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:59.400]   And in fact, pro tip, go, you can search the trademark database and look for trademarks
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.400]   that are similar and just kind of- Cut makes.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.400]   Cut makes.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.400]   Cut makes, baby.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.120]   It's God made cut pastes for that.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:09.160]   You can't trademark the trademark description, isn't that interesting?
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.160]   Plagiarisms, okay.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.160]   Lee.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.160]   Maybe you ought to ask a LegalZoom.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.960]   It's already before you do that.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.520]   LegalZoom.com, use TWIG as the offer code.
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:21.880]   Bring your dreams to life.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:25.520]   Did you know it's national start your own business month?
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.920]   Everybody should have a business.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.920]   So we're all fixed with my good friend Danny Sullivan.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.920]   Search Engine Land.com.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:36.520]   Danny is such a great astute commentator on the scene and we just always love having
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.520]   him on.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.520]   Somebody was saying to the chair, "I'm Danny, you should be a regular."
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.320]   Oh, well, thank you.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.880]   That's really nice.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.440]   I think we were going to do the change log now, but I think we'll do, can we, can we begin
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.920]   before we do the change log with a visit from Google?
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.280]   Yeah, let's do that.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:56.720]   Because this is one of the items on the change log.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.720]   You want to fill us in?
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.080]   What is, is this a new Google+ sign-on capability, right?
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:05.800]   Yeah, Google launched Google+ Sign-In this week, which is kind of the equivalent of Facebook
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   Connect.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:12.120]   So what it does is it enables developers to add a sign-in with Google onto their mobile
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:16.280]   app, onto their website, and you get a few things with that.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:20.600]   Sign-in with Google, your user will need a Google+ account, and then you can say, allow
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:24.360]   this app access to any number of Google apps.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.040]   So this is kind of cool for developers, right?
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.920]   So there's tons of products in Google's, the Google sphere, the ecosystem, yeah, drive
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:34.920]   and Gmail and maps, all kinds of different user data that your app can interact with.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:40.640]   And what happens is when you sign in with Google, you can share your activity on that
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.640]   particular app.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:45.360]   So if you're listening to music, if you purchase something, if you left a review for something,
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:50.280]   if you, if you checked out a restaurant and wanted to go, you can share that activity
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.640]   to your Google+ stream.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.720]   But what's interesting about Google's approach to this, unlike Facebook, which has that kind
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.520]   of frictionless sharing feature, where it just kind of shares out to everyone, everything
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:05.200]   that you do, you can choose what circles get to see your activity.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.800]   And if I understand this correctly, users only see your activity if they go to your profile
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.040]   and then look at it, right?
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:15.560]   So they're saying, so Google's saying this is kind of a spam-free solution to recording
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.240]   your activity in Google+.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:22.960]   Another, another nice part of the feature, if someone signs into your website with Google
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.560]  +, they get it, they get a link to install your mobile app, your Android app directly
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.920]   from the Play Store without a website, which is really, really quite nice.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:34.080]   Well, we've got from the Google+ engineering team, David Glazers on the line with this
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:40.200]   engineering director at Google+, and Seth Sternberg, he's a product management director at Google+,
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.680]   Seth, David, welcome.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.680]   Thank you.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.680]   Thanks.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.680]   So that was Gina's description.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.640]   I like that product.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.640]   You just described it.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:54.400]   You guys should do that.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:58.480]   Is that an accurate description of what the G+ sign-in does?
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.560]   It was, yeah.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.600]   So how does this difference say that OAuth or some other way of using Google to sign in?
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.400]   They're really just levels of the stack.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:14.320]   OAuth is the foundation technology underneath Google+ sign-in and a bunch of other APIs
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.320]   from Google.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:20.920]   It's kind of become the, the, both the fact-o and the girre way that people do, do, do
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.840]   delegated trust, and we like it.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:27.840]   But what's different is when you do Google+ sign-in, we pull together a bunch of different
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:33.040]   capabilities into one easy, simple to adopt and simple for users way to get at a whole
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.880]   range of the capabilities that Google offers.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.600]   And how does it differ from, I mean, it's basically Facebook Connect is the same thing
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.000]   for Facebook, is that right?
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.280]   Or is it different?
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:50.920]   You know, I think they're in the same category of extending identity across one location into
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:51.920]   many locations.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:57.040]   But I think there are a bunch of places where we listen to users who had started to have
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:02.320]   some experience with what does it mean to use my identity from one site and use it across
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:07.920]   a bunch of different sites and listen to those users and say, "Hey, what did they like
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.480]   and what would they like to see more of and see less of?"
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.040]   And try to incorporate that in.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.280]   So, you know, some of the things that you covered very well in your intro about letting
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:22.400]   users really have control over what they share and how they share it, helping users
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:27.880]   feel safe, not only safe around their security and know that they're building on a trusted
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:33.240]   login and identity, but also safe around what happens to their information and what happens
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:38.680]   to their social interaction, that they won't be talking too loudly or talking too softly.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:44.600]   So in launch, you partnered with a number of companies USA Today and I'm on TuneIn Radio,
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.960]   which is one of my favorite radio apps.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.040]   And they're now in addition to Connect with Facebook.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.560]   I see SignIn with Google Plus.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.280]   So that's it, right?
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:57.960]   Well, it depends on how a developer chooses to use the functionality.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.080]   So in a base, there's the SignIn functionality.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.920]   But then for users, I think there's so much more, right?
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:09.480]   A lot of times users have websites and applications that they really love, but they don't know
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.680]   that that website has an Android app that's available.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.440]   So all of a sudden, the user can just really easily find that Android app, right?
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:20.560]   If you're using TuneIn.com and it's like, "Hey, you might want, you know, TuneIn on
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:21.560]   Android."
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:23.080]   I think that's a really great user benefit.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:26.960]   And then at the same time, we put a lot of thought into sharing because we heard, like
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.920]   David was saying, we heard from users, two things that sounded like they couldn't, you
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.280]   know, they were conflicting, right?
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:37.560]   The user said, "When I share, I really want to make sure that my friends see what I share
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.560]   to them.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.560]   I want to know they get it.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.640]   At the same time, I don't want to spam my friends."
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.600]   So we put all this thought into how to do the sharing model right.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.640]   And we came up with a model where if a user explicitly goes to share something, like they
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.160]   share, "Hey, I'm listening to KQED on TuneIn."
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:58.760]   Then when they share that to David, if I put David's name in, he will get a notification
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:01.720]   through all Google properties that says, "Hey, Seth just shared this."
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.200]   And it's not just a notification.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:08.120]   It has a listen button on it so that he can be brought right to TuneIn's app to listen
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.000]   to KQED with me.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.680]   At the same time, we have this notion of activities inside an application.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.600]   And those are not just printing onto people's stream, right?
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:21.640]   Every time you listen to something on KQED, you don't want to spam your friends with all
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.800]   this activity, right?
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.200]   That looks like spam.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:30.240]   And so rather, it's available on my profile for David to see if he wants to come look for
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.240]   it.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:34.840]   So I'm doing the TuneIn radio login here.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:38.800]   And immediately one thing that's different is make your app activity and listen is available
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:43.160]   via Google, visible to you and then you can have your circles or you can have individual
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.000]   people or you can have only you, you get the choice.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.880]   That's the kind of fine control Facebook does not give you right now.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:53.600]   That was one of the things that we heard from our users say really wanted and that's why
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.360]   we surfaced that level of control right up front.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:01.320]   You know, we even gave users the ability to change which of their friends are sent to
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.320]   the app.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:06.760]   So if they're using an app like Fitbit and they only want their exercising buddies to
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.760]   be visible inside Fitbit, they can do that.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.280]   So really it's just a ton of user control in Google+ sign in.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:16.200]   And here's the second part that you were mentioning because I'm on TuneIn radio and
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:21.040]   there's an Android app, the next page says, "Oh, would you also like to install this on
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.240]   your Android device?"
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:27.520]   Now is it going to, when I add it to mine, you see a few Android devices, when I add
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:32.200]   it to my Android device, is it going to in any way know who I am or am I going to go
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.800]   through the same login process through Google+ on the app?
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.640]   So it will remember your settings.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:42.520]   So if you created, you know, like only my music lover circle can see what I've done inside
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.520]   TuneIn.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:48.360]   It will remember that but you will have to re-consen on the mobile side.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:50.760]   That sounds just right actually.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.720]   It's convenient but I also want to re-authorize.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.160]   And the Google+ sign in is available on apps as well, on the Android apps as well.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:00.680]   Oh yeah, we launched it for web, iOS and Android.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:01.680]   It's cool.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.680]   Gina, you're the developer, any questions for...
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.280]   I do so.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:12.320]   So the update that went out to Android, it added this green Google settings icon and
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:16.520]   everyone's Android kind of app drawer that let users kind of control, you know, what
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:21.680]   apps it had allowed access to their Google data.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:24.880]   I just curious to know why that's a separate thing.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.160]   Like why that's not just in your regular Android settings or is this just kind of a
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.160]   first iteration?
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.520]   I don't know, maybe this is too detailed a question.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:36.080]   But I was like, why is this just under my Google account settings, you know, in the
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:38.000]   native settings app?
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:44.520]   Yeah, it's a good question with a fairly boring answer which is technically the mechanisms
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:50.400]   of updating different parts of the UI smoothly and in a way that we sure could provide a
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:56.680]   consistent user experience across a range of devices meant that it was a lot more straightforward
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.240]   to put all of those settings in one new place.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:03.640]   And then I had the other side benefit of making it really visible to the user where they can
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:07.080]   go because we want to, you know, you can see in that dialogue when you're first connecting
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.480]   with TuneIn all that user control.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.720]   And so we've done the same things with settings, right?
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:16.320]   Like a lot of user controls that they know where they can go to change their settings
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.760]   in a given application.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:18.760]   Right, right.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:23.720]   And I had one other question about the kind of the interactive sharing bits where you said,
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.640]   you know, and I like this, I think this is the right approach where if you do share a
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.080]   bit of activity that there's often an action button associated with.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.240]   So I listened to the song, you should listen to it too, or I really like this product,
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.240]   here's a link to buy it.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.160]   And I thought I read somewhere and correct me if I'm wrong, is there a way, so say I'm
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.880]   giving a product a negative review, and I'm actually not telling my friends to buy it.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.440]   I'm telling them not to buy it.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.360]   There's a way to say like, don't show that buy button or there's a way to specify what
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.400]   the action should be, like based on what the data that's being shared.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.240]   So what happened there, I think it was beauty-ish, one of our launch partners, they, you know,
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.720]   they can do that on their own side.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.720]   They invented that piece.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:05.840]   We built it, but we didn't quite realize how that use case and they came up with it.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.840]   It was nice.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.120]   And that's actually a design point of something we've done here is we're trying to, you know,
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.760]   walk an interesting line where we're building hopefully really great stuff for users, but
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.720]   also really powerful capability for developers to let them just imagine things that we never
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.720]   would.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:26.200]   And that example that beauty-ish came up with, frankly, we did not.
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.280]   And technically the way it works is very simple.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:33.600]   When beauty-ish writes the, you know, pop share dialogue now code, they pass in parameters.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.560]   And one of the parameters is what action button do they want to include?
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.640]   So in their case, they could simply say, if the user's coming from the context of loving
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.680]   a product, let's include action, let's include the buy action.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:49.480]   And if they're coming from a context of disling a product, let's include either no action
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.480]   or a different action.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.720]   Yeah, that's really nice because there are times when you see, you know, UI buttons that
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.920]   just make absolutely no sense, you know, a friend of mine on Facebook or wherever on
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.720]   Google+ is like, I've having a horrible day and that's like like this and it just doesn't,
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.560]   it doesn't make no sense at all.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.040]   I really like when developers get that kind of control to say like this is the appropriate
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040]   call to action here.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.800]   So I like that a lot.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.000]   Someone in the chat room asked about the API for this.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.400]   So I imagine an SDK for this has dropped for the various platforms and is available now
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.880]   for developers to try out.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.640]   It's all up there.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.120]   developers.google.com/plus.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:32.720]   And you'll find documentation for Android, for iOS and for web access with client libraries
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.800]   and sample code available for all of the above.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.560]   And we found it takes about, you know, a day to get an initial working like a simple sign
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.000]   on and then for really great integrations, only about two weeks.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.480]   But you know, it really depends what, again, what people want to do with the tools we put
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:48.480]   out there.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.480]   Right.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.200]   You got a sample app right there on the page and everything.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.200]   That's cool.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.200]   Nito.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.440]   Seth, David, I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   Awesome.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.280]   You guys are coming on.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:04.120]   So are most Android phones going to get an OTA update to enable this or how is that going
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.120]   to work?
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.120]   That it, yes.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.120]   Okay.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.840]   And I don't know exactly the progress of that rollout, but it's pretty far along now.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.000]   I got one on my sprint galaxy note yesterday.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.360]   It sounds like you have enough that you can sort of watch the project.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.360]   [laughter]
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.360]   In case it's.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.120]   Everybody with Froyo and above should be getting an update that'll enable all this.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.880]   And it's available for poll earlier.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.360]   So if we're going to install an app that would get pulled.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.360]   Yeah, we just pull it.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360]   Oh, cool.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.360]   All right.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.360]   Nice.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.360]   Nito, before they go, can you ask or can I ask?
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.360]   Go ahead.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.840]   What's going to happen with Google accounts?
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:41.840]   Because, you know, we've had this existing system we can use to log into websites already,
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.680]   which was Google accounts.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.840]   And I got the impression that that's going to go away and now it's all going to be Google
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.840]   Plus accounts.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.520]   So are you going to be able to use both types of things?
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.120]   Or is Google account sign in?
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.200]   Is that going to become, is that going to go away down the line?
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.400]   So what we are encouraging people to use the new sign in with Google Plus that we just
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.760]   launched because we think it's a better experience for users and developers.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.920]   But we're not making any changes to the existing capability.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:13.160]   We don't want to break any existing sites, you know, just cold turkey.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.600]   And we are saying, hey, you want to check out this new stuff?
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.840]   You're probably going to find that it does more for you and for your users.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.200]   But no changes today to anything existing.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.160]   And importantly, with the new Google Plus sign in, developers can call any existing
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.160]   Google scopes.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:32.320]   So if they're using the current Google sign in to get calendar access or email access
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.840]   or drive access, they can do the exact same thing with the new Google Plus sign in.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.840]   Yep.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.840]   Okay.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:40.840]   Good.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.840]   Because I'm using the Google.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.840]   Well, now this is interesting.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.840]   This is a discuss I think we use.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.760]   It's weird because you can't tell and discuss.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.480]   I think it's still like G plus, but it's still use.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480]   Okay.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.960]   It's got a plus next to the G.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:00.040]   You know, you have one Google account, whether or not you've created a plus file for it versus
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.640]   B, there are a plus a enhanced would be.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:08.760]   But like I said, with what Leah was like with discuss, you get discuss is showing you
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:14.760]   a Google plus icon, even though the login that you're using isn't the Google plus sign.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.760]   Oh, I know.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.160]   It's actually a cool thing on.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.720]   So I'll do do that.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.920]   Call those guys.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.080]   People have already made the transition before you even got to them.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.080]   Because I just did it.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.080]   I pressed it.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.280]   And I think it was just Google, just a regular Google sign on.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.520]   I don't think it was a Google plus sign.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.360]   Hey, Seth, the day, but why thank you for.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.360]   It's like a four second.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.360]   Yes.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360]   Go ahead.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.360]   Jeff has a question for you.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.360]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.440]   Oh, Rick Byers, who's on the Chromebook team, sent me an email saying he was going to watch
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440]   the show just because he is.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.800]   He's in the chat room right now.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:47.000]   If I had a computer made for me now, I want now I want a Google plus fix me.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   Okay.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   Thank you.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.920]   I'm having problems, guys, but the fact that I'm a loyal Google apps user, I go immediately
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:55.920]   on the Google plus.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.320]   Now I have two identities.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.520]   It's driving my world crazy.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.520]   Yes.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.520]   I know I'm going to go.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.520]   I lose all kind of stuff on it.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.520]   All kind of confusing.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.080]   I just want to put them together into one and just be one person with you.
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.080]   I'm too skitzo.
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.080]   Okay.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.080]   Please.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.080]   I think they're gone.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.160]   Oh, no, they're there.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:17.640]   They're just looking at you like home back with the insanity of it.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.640]   Yes.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.640]   Each act.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.080]   We actually just lost them.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.080]   They just hung up.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.080]   Oh, no.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.080]   I'll see you later, guys.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.080]   That's a very good guy.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.360]   But didn't you, Gino, also, for years you've been complaining about this, didn't they solve
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.480]   it a little bit for you, merging the two or something?
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.880]   But I actually went around this week again.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.240]   I was trying to go around and you lose stuff along the way and it's complicated and it's
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.800]   risky and it's just complicated.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800]   There are ways to migrate.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.960]   You do lose stuff along the way.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.400]   I never move my Google plus account over to my apps account because I just have so many
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.720]   certain circles that I just don't want to lose them.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.720]   And I just switch.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.000]   I just use the Google account switch, which is annoying at times.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.080]   But you can't use that on a Chrome.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.080]   Oh, what?
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.080]   Is you only have one?
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.080]   Yes, you can.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.080]   Yes, you can.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.040]   On the Chromebook Pixel, you can totally switch because I have two accounts.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.680]   I use one account for Google plus and my calendar and all that stuff.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.360]   But you're not going back entirely.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:14.000]   I have a Google apps account for the only reason, which is I wanted to have email in
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.200]   my own domain name.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.200]   But you can only use one at a time.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.200]   You're not.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.200]   But you can switch between.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.200]   There's a little option.
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.200]   You can toggle.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.200]   You can do it.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.200]   It works pretty well.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.200]   Jeff, got to buy a Pixel now, Jeff.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.200]   I got to go.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.200]   Got to buy a Pixel.
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.200]   Well, we thank David Glaser.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.200]   I don't know.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.700]   Go check Danny.
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:37.360]   We thank you David Glaser, engineering director at Google plus and Seth Sternberg, project
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.880]   management, product management director at Google plus for filling us in on that new
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:42.880]   feature.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.680]   It was great to have them on the show.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.680]   We weren't too hard on them.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.680]   We'll get more glitters on the future.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.680]   I think it was just scary to be honest.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.080]   No, no, it was a Skype issue.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.040]   Yeah, we had a skylock issue.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:58.120]   But they do have to rest as well as long as they're gone.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.120]   You can do that on a regular Chrome.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.920]   You can do it on a Chrome book or just give it a little thing at the top corner that'll
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.560]   be in the top right corner and look down there.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:06.560]   You should see a thing.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.040]   This is an ad account and you should be able to do it.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.360]   Well, Danny, you just replaced it in my heart.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.360]   Aw.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.360]   That's it.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.360]   That's it.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360]   That's it.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.360]   Not replaced.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.360]   Enhanced.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.360]   Enhanced.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.360]   It's my Danny plug-in.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:25.680]   All right, we're going to take a break when we come back the full Google change log with
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.480]   Gina Trapani and a lot more.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.120]   Danny Sullivan is here from Search Engine Land.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:35.520]   He's the new life hacker editor when it comes to Chromebooks.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.320]   Oh, no.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.320]   Oh, no.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.240]   He's always great to have you, Danny.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.880]   Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York and Buzzmachine.com, Gina Trapani from
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.880]   Smarter Word.
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.680]   Oh, he's pulled out the Samsung Chromebook.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.680]   Breaking it out.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.360]   You know, that just looks so cheap compared to a pixel.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:55.400]   I think you should get a pixel.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.560]   You'd be so much happier, Jeff.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.040]   You're a drug dealer, aren't you?
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.040]   I just don't.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.040]   I don't want to buy.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.040]   I don't want to.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.040]   I don't want to.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.040]   I want you to buy it.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.000]   After the fact of a break, I'll go and I'll grab mine and I'll show you the best part
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   of it.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   Oh.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.600]   So we're going to get a special show and tell with Danny in just a moment.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.240]   First, a word about backup.
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:21.440]   You were talking about backing up your docs.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.280]   Maybe you don't trust Google Drive enough.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.280]   Add carbonite.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.560]   Now you got it all interlocking.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.520]   Interlocking backup.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.560]   You every, you know, this is the 321 backup rule.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.880]   My friend, Peter Krogh, photographer, wrote the digital asset management book.
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.320]   He's an expert on this stuff.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.720]   In fact, he, there's a great website you could read that he created with the Association
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.040]   of Professional Photographers in the Library of Commerce.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.360]   It's called DP for Digital Photography, DPBestFlow.org.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:49.920]   And among other things, he's talking about all the different workflow things that photographers
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.080]   should consider.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.080]   He talks about backup.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.080]   Of course, that's important.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.520]   If you're a photographer, you can't lose those images.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.880]   It's like a picture of a wedding.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.400]   They're not going to stage the wedding again.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.040]   If you lose the pictures, you cannot lose them.
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.040]   So he talks about something.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.920]   He calls 321 backup, three copies of everything.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.800]   That could be an original and two backups.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:08.960]   That's fine.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.600]   Two different media.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.120]   So a disk and a USB key, I guess that would be all right.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:17.040]   Better would be a disk and the internet.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.760]   And absolutely one of them needs to be offsite because, you know, you're not backed up.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.920]   If you've got everything sitting next to the computer and the house burns down, it's all
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.920]   going.
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.880]   Or, you know, or somebody steals your stuff.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.880]   There's all sorts of disasters.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.760]   You got to get stuff offsite.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.520]   321, this is the easy way to do it.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.160]   Carbonite.com.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:40.560]   To back up with carbonite, $59 a year for everything on your computer, Mac or PC.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:45.280]   And they do have different versions for small business, the external drives and all of that.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:51.560]   But the basic plan, $59 per computer per year, less than five bucks per month per computer.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.800]   The backup is automatic and continuous whenever you're online.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.720]   And it's backing up to the carbonite cloud.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.480]   It's encrypted on the way using SSL.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.520]   But if you want further encryption than only you hold the key, you could do that too.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.520]   Carbonite enables that.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.320]   It is a very good solution.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.720]   Now you can try it free.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.720]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.680]   Just go to carbonite.com.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:13.560]   Click that orange download free trial now button and use our offer code twig.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.320]   You get 14 days to try it free.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.960]   That's usually enough to get your first backup set up to the carbonite cloud.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:25.120]   And then if you decide to buy, you'll get 14 months for the price of 12 to three months.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:28.160]   But you got to use the offer code twig at carbonite.com.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.160]   You got to back it up to get it back.
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.960]   So do it right.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.960]   It's carbonite.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.040]   All right.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.480]   What is the special before we do the change log?
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.600]   What is the special sexy, sexy chrome, all feature?
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.600]   This is your sexy.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.600]   This is it there.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.680]   And if you see up here at the top, yeah, that indentation, we have the light bar and when
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:57.480]   the laptop is open, the light bar will start to glow.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.880]   Oh, it's pulsing.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.920]   But it's in different and it will pulse.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.760]   And then this, the best part, they only last briefly.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.960]   When you shut it, you get the green flash.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.320]   Oh, Google colors rainbow.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.800]   I saw rainbow.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:12.800]   Hang on.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:13.800]   I can repeat it.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   It's really easy.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800]   I am.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.800]   No, no, no.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.800]   It's shut it.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.960]   Oh, I'd pay $1400 for that.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.960]   Buy it.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.960]   Buy it.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:28.400]   The odd thing is what you want is for that to keep going when it's.
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.400]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.840]   I'm here about my battery at that point.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.840]   It's cool.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.840]   And I wanted to keep glowing.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.020]   No, it's like the green flash at a sunset.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.320]   You shut your Mac and it's glowing, that little white things going on with the little
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.320]   bar to keep going.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.560]   It doesn't, it doesn't do that.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.400]   So someone needs to ride a hack to make the light bar go.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.720]   The only thing missing on that, and I can't understand why they left it out and so does,
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.160]   so does our buyers in our chat room who designed the damn thing, where's the USB three
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.160]   port?
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.760]   It's got two USB two ports.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.840]   It's odd.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.880]   The light bar indicates, is the battery indicator or it's just just for fun?
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.520]   It's just for fun.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.240]   It's just like when it's open, it's blowing.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.080]   And when you shut it, it flashes and it turns off.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:15.320]   When you go to the website, it even says light bar just for fun.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:19.400]   You really digested the marketing on this, Danny.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.400]   I can tell.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.440]   But, but our buyers, wait a minute, our buyers Rick in our chat room, he's the guy.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.680]   He works on the team, he says, it also is a battery indicator.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.400]   Well, it is.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.120]   I don't have any idea how it tells me what it's doing.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:36.040]   Well, maybe we should call Rick and get him on.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.360]   What does it just go down when the battery goes down?
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.960]   Got right now, right?
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.320]   So it's not doing anything.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.080]   So I don't, I don't have any indication from it.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.000]   And there's no button that I pushed to do it.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.960]   Oh, yeah, you got to go up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.960]   And then it will do it.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.680]   Oh, poor buyers.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.280]   It goes to red below a certain battery level.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.280]   Okay.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.720]   Oh, well, so you just never let it go.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:01.680]   I'll run it down right away.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.960]   We should, you know what, Rick, we should come on because I want to know like, okay,
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.480]   so what was the mission statement?
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.800]   Did, did, did, you know, Larry come in and say, look, prices, no object design.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:15.560]   The most beautiful Chromebook you can think of must have been, right?
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.560]   Come dive into the shark tank.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:24.280]   I mean, this isn't the most, the most positive.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.280]   First, the funny thing is now all of us are staring at the chat and not talking to each
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.920]   other, which just proves we're all being rude to each other.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:33.640]   Yeah, see our buyers is so much and more important than the rest of you.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.240]   He says, bring it on guys.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.240]   I love it.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.240]   I love it.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.880]   I love a Googlers are game.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:40.880]   Awesome.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.760]   Game Googlers next.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:49.360]   But first, it's time to play the trumpets for the change law.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.120]   The Google change log.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:58.160]   Put that on your Chromebook and smoke it.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.120]   Every week, Gina, Tarpani tells us what's new with Google.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.560]   Yeah, we got a few new things in Gmail search and Chrome.
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.640]   Let me, let me run through them.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.520]   They're all kind of minor, but also kind of neat.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.440]   First we have brand new arrow key navigation in Gmail.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:16.240]   So this is for folks using the web interface for Gmail.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.920]   You like your keyboard shortcuts.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.080]   They just got better.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:23.960]   If your thread list or your list of labels is in focus, you can use your arrow keys to
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:27.800]   go up and down and you've got a screen reader, a screen reader can read to you where you
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.800]   are.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.240]   So just a nice little tweak there.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:36.520]   I've talked before about there's a Gmail field search trial for Google search.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.720]   So you have to opt into this.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.240]   It's Google.com/experimental/gmailfieldtrial.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:46.760]   This is the field trial that adds your personal information to your Google search results.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.760]   So we talked before about how you can, if you booked a flight and there's a confirmation
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.000]   email in your Gmail and you search my flights, that'll show you whether or not your flight's
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.680]   on time, when it's departing.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.440]   It'll show you files from your Google Drive.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:03.360]   It'll show you recent receipts if you bought something, say from Amazon.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.360]   Well they just added upcoming events in your Google calendar to this list.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:12.280]   So if you enter this field trial and you search for something that shows up your calendar,
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.360]   that'll also show up in your search results.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:19.520]   Chrome has gotten a few new things that I'm kind of excited about.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:23.320]   First, we've got new Better Spell Check in Chrome.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.920]   Google says we've refreshed the dictionaries for Chrome's default spell checker.
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:31.440]   They've added support for Korean and Albanian and to meal.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.640]   I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:35.480]   But this is a really cool feature.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:38.440]   Chrome will now sync your custom dictionary across your devices.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.080]   So if you add a word to your dictionary, like I always have to add life hacker, I don't
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.080]   do that once.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.800]   And then Chrome, if I'm syncing that, if I've got a custom dictionary sync set up, that'll
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.920]   show up on all my other devices as well.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.320]   And users can enable that Ask Google for Suggestions feature.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:54.880]   That's that digi-mean.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.320]   Google's constantly kind of monitoring the web for how people spell things.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.960]   Google's rolling out support for grammar and hominim and context sensitive spell checking
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.360]   in English.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.760]   So that's using the same technology behind Google Search.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.320]   And understands proper nouns like Bieber or Skrillex.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.320]   So I'm going to really start with Google's spell check.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.320]   It's an improper noun.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.920]   It's in a wide range from Bieber to Skrillex and everywhere in between.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.120]   Well, Skrillex, Google Chrome has a better spell check.
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:25.800]   So users on Windows Linux and Chrome OS will get these enhancements.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:30.360]   In the coming weeks, Google says that Mac support is coming soon.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:35.120]   Also Chrome has got the Web Speech API in the latest stable build.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.360]   I think I brought this up in the changelog when it hit the beta build.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.200]   The Web Speech API basically means you're going to see more web apps that take voice
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:47.200]   commands, which is really cool because it's in the latest stable build.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.280]   Google's also sort of merging Chrome OS into regular Chrome.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:56.120]   Google just ported the Chrome OS app launcher, which is kind of the start menu, into the
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.200]   Chrome browser dev channel.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:01.000]   So and that's happening on Windows right now.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.560]   Mac and Linux is coming soon.
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:06.760]   That means there'll just be a little button that launches your web apps, your Chrome apps
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760]   menu.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:11.360]   And fear not, if you don't use Chrome apps, that will not show up at all.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:16.760]   You have to install-- you have to install a Chrome app in order to see that menu at all.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.680]   This is the thing that I'm super excited about.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.000]   It's far downstream still.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.080]   It's not going to hit the stable build yet, but I'm excited about this.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:30.480]   This Canary build of Chrome has a new feature that shows what tabs are playing audio.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.480]   Finally.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.840]   Even if they're flash going, right?
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.280]   So you'll basically have to see this little audio throbber in your fav icon.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.160]   So if you got a bunch of tabs open and one is playing music, this has happened to all
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.920]   of us, and it's happened to us even on the show.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.920]   And something is playing music as an ad or something.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:45.920]   It's making you crazy.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:46.920]   You don't know what tab.
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.320]   You can just look at your fav icons and close it.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.680]   So I'm excited about that.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:54.880]   This is the Canary build of Google Chrome, which is separate from Chromium.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.080]   So we're not guaranteed to get this, but I think this is something people want well
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.080]   enough.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.200]   I think this is going to hit our desktops eventually.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:07.720]   Finally, Google Finance added Singapore, Korean, and Israel stock exchanges.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.840]   For those of you following international stocks.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.600]   So that's kind of update there.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.200]   And Google+ sign in, we just talked about.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.680]   So that's all I got today.
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:18.680]   The change log.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.680]   And that's a lot.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.680]   Google change log.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:27.680]   It was a lot of little things today, but good stuff.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.360]   I'm trying to find the menu.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.360]   The app menu.
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.880]   Where would that show up?
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.880]   So it's Windows only.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.320]   Oh, so you're on Windows right now.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.320]   And you know, it's interesting.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:42.320]   This screenshot here, the next web had a screenshot of what it looks like in ChromeOS,
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.360]   but that's kind of in the doc there.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.640]   So I'm actually not sure how they're going to.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.080]   The beta channel one too.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.080]   This is not.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.080]   Right.
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.080]   It looks like.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.160]   Jeff, do you use this app?
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.320]   This app drawer?
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.320]   I use it.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.320]   It's on my Chromebook already.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.320]   Right.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.320]   It's on your Chromebook.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.320]   But so it's this button with the grid.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.320]   That looks like it.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.080]   Well, on the bottom of my Chromebook, it has five buttons, one of which is the button
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.080]   with the grid.
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.080]   Right.
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.080]   Right.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.080]   Now I'm looking.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.080]   I don't know.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.080]   I don't have a Leo because I'm on Mac.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:16.600]   It should be a button with a grid somewhere, maybe in your footer, in a new tab in Chrome.
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.520]   Well I don't see it, but that's all right.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.960]   You might not have gotten it yet.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:24.440]   Chrome is auto-updated with better spell checks spelled the same way you did it.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.040]   I thought that was your you going B-E-T-T-A-R.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.040]   No, that was there.
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.040]   Never headline.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.040]   Google Gaws there.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040]   They're funny.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.040]   Honey funny.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.880]   I don't know where it is.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:37.280]   I don't see it anywhere.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:39.160]   I mean, here's all my apps.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:43.640]   It says that you'll get the launcher in the Windows test bar the first time you installed.
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.480]   Maybe it's all up to Windows.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.480]   Oh, Windows.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.880]   And it's the dev channel.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.280]   So you write live on the board.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.080]   I'm in the dev channel.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.080]   You never beta.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.240]   Oh, that's dev not beta.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.240]   There's a difference.
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.040]   No, I'm in beta.
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.800]   Never mind.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.160]   So yeah, so it'll be in the test bar.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.400]   So it's not in the test bar yet.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   Okay, good.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.400]   Cool.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.400]   I'll look for it.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.400]   Nice to know.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.400]   Let's see.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:14.720]   Well, I think Leo, I need to give an update.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.240]   I need to give the weekly update.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.360]   The rant we could even have a we actually have a rant theme after you're done.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.600]   We'll play the rant through Jeff Rance theme.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:25.720]   We have to do, of course, the LYSTUN should threat update.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.720]   Got to be.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.440]   Because I don't even wait for that, right?
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.440]   Yes.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.440]   Yes.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:38.600]   So it's been going through the Bundestag and there's been an effort to find a compromise
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:39.600]   still dangerous.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:43.920]   But it's the funny thing is the one world of the parties proposed amendment that said
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:48.960]   there was okay to do one word quotes or small snippets.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.960]   One word.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.880]   So no way can own a word that says.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.120]   And that ridiculous, right?
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.120]   One word you could.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.120]   How small is a small snippet?
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.120]   You could know.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.120]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.120]   We didn't define it.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:02.120]   So one party defined it as 160 characters convenient that it was nearly Twitter size.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.120]   Twitter size.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.120]   That a tweet would be okay.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.280]   And now they just really say small snippets.
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:11.040]   The irony of this is I understand it through my hazy awful bad German is that what it means
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.920]   is the publishers went crazy saying, no Google, you can't quote snippets.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:19.520]   You have to pay snippets, which is the entire purpose of the law, which is try to blackmail
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.240]   Google into pain.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.920]   And now if that's out of the law, then what does it mean?
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:27.240]   It just means that it's basically a copyright law again that says you got to pay us for
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:32.200]   content, but they don't define what's too small to pay for.
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:36.640]   So it's going to be just as Laurie Lastic would say, it's just a right to hire lawyers.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.640]   It's a fact to mess right now.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.720]   But that's my life struggles, Schutzwerk update.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:46.360]   Do we have a rant theme yet or is that we're working on it still?
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:49.360]   Wait a minute, hold on.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.680]   We're putting it in the queue.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.880]   Jeff Jarvis, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:02.520]   That's from the same guy to the change log, right?
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.520]   Yes.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.520]   Yes.
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520]   Jesse Wiener.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.240]   I'm going to plug because Jesse's trying to make a career out of doing just that.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.760]   Just that God knows there must be somewhere that needs that.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:17.520]   So he said, I learned how to do this at Harvard and this is how the internet, how this is
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.840]   how people getting to know me.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:20.600]   That's what Harvard is all about.
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.120]   That's an Ivy League education for you.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:26.200]   Why did they launch a nexus one into space?
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:30.680]   It's the first phone to get to the other side.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.480]   All done.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:39.440]   Let's see.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:43.480]   France is going to, I want, now as bad as France is, because I guess they're talking
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:47.400]   now about a data tax.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.360]   This is magnificently absurd.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:52.400]   So they want to say that, and now they're trying to go after it another way, trying to
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.400]   go after people another way.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.200]   So if you gather data about people, that has value.
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.200]   So we should tax that.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.840]   Now, of course, and the government should get that, not us, the government.
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.240]   Well, what they're saying is cut this down.
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:07.640]   And we're going to tax knowledge that when you acquire knowledge, we're going to tax that.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:11.280]   How offensive can you get?
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.280]   Man.
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.280]   Mad, qua.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:21.160]   Well, maybe that's how they're going to pay for the 20 billion euro high speed internet
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.120]   that everybody in France is going to get.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.680]   This is Francois Hollande's idea.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:30.200]   You know, if you're smaller country, I mean, France is small geographically compact, not
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:33.360]   that small, but small enough, I guess.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:38.440]   What a great idea for jump starting economic development.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.960]   They say it could directly generate 10,000 jobs, but it also creates a nation of knowledge
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:52.840]   workers and you can tax that high speed broadband in the densely populated areas of about $7 billion.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.720]   Telco is likely to bear the funding of that.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:02.000]   $13 billion to come from the federal government in the more rural areas, the low population
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.960]   density areas.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:07.360]   This is what kind of Google Gigabit, right?
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.720]   But done by the federal government.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.000]   He said that it wouldn't all be paid by the government by the government.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.640]   13 out of the 20 is government, 7 billion comes from.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:22.880]   They didn't say what speed, but what they define as high speed broadband is 50 megabits
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:26.600]   or better down and five megabits are better up.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.360]   I'd like that.
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.600]   I have better than that now with my files.
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.600]   Do you?
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.840]   I got 50 down and 25 up.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.000]   I would move to France to get that.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.560]   And a few other things and a few other things.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.560]   Stinky cheese.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.120]   How do you say this weekend in tech in French?
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:53.640]   The Sesame technology.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.640]   CSET.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.640]   So classy.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:09.840]   Everything that I said, just be level up.
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.520]   Kickstarter at the Oscars.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.520]   That's nice.
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.520]   That was pretty cool.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.520]   Academy Award.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.520]   Amazing.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.120]   What was the best short documentary?
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.120]   Short.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:20.120]   It's a very nice short.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.120]   Was partially funded by Kickstarter.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:26.400]   There were a number of nominees, I think, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.400]   Kickstarter funded.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.400]   We have Parry from Kickstarter Committee to speak to more of my students.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.920]   I'm really looking forward to it.
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:37.800]   The other guy we have coming to my class on Monday is the founder of Three Doodler from
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:38.800]   last week.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.800]   Three Doodler.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.600]   Oh, the three Doodler.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.160]   I'm the Doodler.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.160]   Did you get yours yet?
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.760]   No, no, I was looking for a while yet.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:52.120]   I went to the Kairos with a K conference at the New York Stock Exchange run by the son
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:55.920]   of Navin Jane, an entrepreneur I worked with many years ago.
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.400]   And he just said, "Oh, yeah, I saw him at the LEDs.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:58.400]   You have to come."
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.400]   Amazing.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:04.560]   50 really great college entrepreneurs with another 350 college students there and then
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:08.480]   mentors read old people like me hanging around.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.880]   And there was really just amazing, amazing young people.
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:16.400]   So Max, the guy who started the co-founder of the Three Doodler just happened to be there.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.080]   And there was an empty table.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.520]   And so he put down and I saw the Eiffel Tower that they made.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.520]   Wow.
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.520]   I said, "Three Doodler."
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.520]   I said, "I bought one."
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.920]   You didn't buy one, Jeff.
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.960]   You look kick-started the project.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:29.960]   Next-time the project.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:32.000]   So he looks around and he says, "I'm not always using the table."
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.480]   So he opens up his notebook, shows me some stuff.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:37.000]   He pulls out a earlier prototype and he's like the head of the plays.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.680]   Every time he goes upwards, making the 3D stuff, people go, "Ooh."
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.200]   And they're all making that stuff.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.200]   And it was great fun.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.200]   I can't wait to have it now.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:48.840]   I'm doing something wrong because I ordered stuff on Kickstarter, but the stuff I get is
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   not cool.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.840]   Like this.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.840]   Well, I ordered this on Kickstarter.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:57.840]   It's called the "The Ostrich Pillow."
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.120]   I swear to God, this was a $75.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.440]   I've only received two things.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:04.080]   One's a bra.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.080]   You got your pebble.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.080]   Oh, you got your pebble.
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.880]   I still don't have that pebble even.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.680]   Unopened because I'm selling it.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.680]   You're selling it?
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:11.680]   Why?
