[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Jeff Jarvis is here, Ant Pruitt, and filling in for Stacy Higginbotham, Shoshone Weisman.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.900]   We're going to have a lot of fun.
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.000]   Twitter is holding Elon Musk's feet to the fire.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.800]   They said, "You said you were going to buy us.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.700]   Now you got to."
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.300]   Big tech is suing SCOTUS to stop that Texas social media law.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.900]   And why you can't always blame algorithms.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.200]   Plus, Jeff Jarvis terrifies us all with news of monkeypox.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.500]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.700]   Don't worry, it's okay.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.000]   On Twig.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Podcasts you love from people you trust.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.700]   This is Twig.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.500]   This is Twig.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.700]   This week in Google, episode 664 recorded Wednesday, May 18, 2022.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.600]   Slothtoberfest.

[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.200]   Buck Mason's clothes are second to none.

[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.100]   Traditional audio conferencing systems can entail lots of components.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.300]   Installation can take days and you might not get the mic coverage you need.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.300]   That's complex-pensive.
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.000]   But Nureva audio is easy to install and manage.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.200]   No technicians required and you get true full-room coverage.

[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.000]   We talk about the latest news from the Google verse, the Twitter verse, the Facebook verse,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.600]   all the verses at Pruitt's here, hands-on photography, Maven community director, a club twit.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.400]   And his shirt says no, but his eyes say yes, yes, yes.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.900]   Whoo! Whoo!
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.900]   I'm just going to chill all up with that last one.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.400]   I'm sorry everyone for doing that.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.600]   I know I have a way.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.800]   He's taken ladies.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   He's taken.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.500]   That's the letter to our professor for journalistic innovation, ladies and gentlemen, from the Craig Craig.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.600]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.400]   And Stacey has a week off, but Jeff has brought us somebody I'm very excited to meet.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.600]   Shoshana Weisman is here.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.700]   She is from our street.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.200]   She's a digital media and head of digital media and a fellow at the R Street.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.500]   Think Tank, political think tank.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.700]   She's also Senator Shoshana from East Virginia.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.400]   It's so great to have you.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.200]   I hope your primary bid goes well.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   Yeah, it was actually fine yesterday.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.000]   Oh, good.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.800]   Well, Shana, Seisman lost.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.500]   Oh, good.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.800]   I hated her.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.000]   Okay.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:17.900]   We have a lot to talk about, but I guess I'm going to have to break our covenant not to talk.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.200]   We don't talk about Elon.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.800]   We're not.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.400]   We're going to have to.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.900]   Oh, we have to talk about Elon.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.600]   The plot thickens.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.300]   So Elon who was the skull.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:38.900]   So yeah, as soon as the tongue, Elon agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 without doing any due diligence.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.600]   That was literally part of the agreement.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.100]   Okay.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.700]   No problem.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.900]   No due diligence.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.100]   Then apparently somebody supposed to do.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.700]   One normally does when you bid $44 billion for something.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.800]   Even if it's the people whose money or even if it's not your money on that.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.400]   Yeah, but that but he got.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.700]   I think he's getting cold feet, which I wouldn't blame him.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.400]   He suddenly noticed that Twitter has a lot of bots on it.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.200]   A lot of spam bots on it.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.500]   And he said, well, I had no way had no idea.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.800]   This is going to put this on hold.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.400]   Now the latest is Twitter saying, you know, we're going to hold you to it.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.500]   You sign in the bottom line.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.400]   This house is yours.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.000]   This will be a very interesting thing.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.200]   I think the market is feeling like it's not going to happen.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   We, you know, we talk about the wisdom of the crowds and we ask our pun markets feeling like nothing good is going to happen right now.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.000]   Right now, my FU money just said FU again.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Oh Lord, Lord, don't even get me started.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.800]   Yeah, that's that's right.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.300]   A lot of us will be putting retirement off again.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.500]   Get rid of us.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.800]   Oh, we're going to down now to $36.85.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.300]   Elon offered 5420.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.600]   That tells you the market has, you know, does has no faith is going to happen.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.900]   Otherwise it would be closer to that.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.400]   Right.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.600]   5420.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:07.700]   So Mike Masnek had a nice parlor game wondering that if Elon leaves and the and he's managed to bring the stock way down who might come in.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.900]   His thought was Microsoft.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.400]   Nobody.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.000]   Now it's nuts.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.800]   Okay.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.300]   So if this doesn't go through, isn't he on the hook for a billion dollars?
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.700]   No, Twitter says Twitter's not even looking for the cancellation fee.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.600]   Twitter wants him to.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.200]   They said, no, no, you agreed.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.900]   You said there would be no due diligence.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.300]   You have no out on this.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.600]   Twitter might have an out because he was apparently broken their NDA and disparaged them.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.200]   He said it.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.300]   This is very mature.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.900]   I have to say he did something that even Donald Trump never did on Twitter.
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.600]   He said the CEO of Twitter, a poop emoji.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.100]   Oh, wow.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.400]   Even Trump never sank that low.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.300]   Wow.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.800]   I don't think I think Masnek's nuts.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.600]   I don't think anybody wants Twitter.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.100]   Twitter's been for sale for years.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.200]   This has never been a money maker.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:01.000]   I don't think anybody wants Twitter and he definitely gives him a German is maybe betting off.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.400]   He wants to clean up the Internet.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.200]   No, no, Shoshana.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.400]   It's great to have you.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.000]   Welcome.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.200]   And she's coming to us.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   You want to buy Twitter?
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:19.300]   I was gonna, but I decided to buy something else instead because I definitely have that amount of money, just not not for Twitter.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.100]   Because of it.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.200]   We maybe people don't know, but you are married.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.800]   Is it to SpongeBob himself?
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.400]   So many people don't know that.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.700]   The residuals, man, are killer.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:40.100]   I mean, is there official our street position on the on us at this point?
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.100]   So we just kind of think everyone's flipping out and we're staying out of it a little.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.600]   Yeah, why?
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   Like, yeah, like it could work out fine.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.200]   It might not.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.700]   I don't know.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.800]   But what I will say is as someone who watches cartoons a lot, this reminds me.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.100]   No, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.000]   Of the King of the Hill episode where Hank doesn't want to sell his house.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.200]   So he ruins it strategically and the home inspector comes and like realizes what he's doing.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.000]   And I kind of like wonder if Twitter is like, oh man, look at all these bots.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.100]   It's yours now.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:17.500]   And then like to dissuade him and like, I mean, someone made a comment that like the producers is kind of like the more.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.900]   Comparison, but it's more to me, that King of the Hill episode like that.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.400]   Very like you nailed it.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.700]   You know, ruining the house.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.200]   Sick.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.900]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.200]   Although it's not exactly the same because he doesn't own it yet.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.700]   But I mean, like Twitter saying there's more bots than their own.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.900]   Oh, Twitter doesn't want to.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.100]   It's like, yeah, Twitter did though.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:43.200]   Agrawal did tell shareholders, we want you to take this deal and we're going to hold on to it.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.400]   So I, who knows who, who knows what the motives are.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.200]   This is crazy.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.700]   I do have a question though for you since you cover government.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.300]   Why hasn't the SEC done something about Elon?
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:01.500]   He's just, he's, I think one of the things he's getting away with at this point is just completely flouting all the rules.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.200]   I mean, is this the SEC pretty much like a figurehead or just?
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.800]   No.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.700]   I mean, they just sort of say,
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:12.300]   you find a 20 million 40 if you include the Tesla fine, but the barely 20 or 40 million dollars.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.700]   Did they get it out of his pockets or?
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.500]   Yeah, but he wants it back, but he's not.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:22.100]   The judge said no, every time I hear Elon Musk and SEC, I'm thinking, Oh, this is just another nothing burger.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.000]   Nothing's going to happen.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.900]   No, they say they're investigating him again.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.900]   Is the SEC a toothless tiker?
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.500]   So I haven't really touched the SEC before.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.700]   I don't do financial regulation because personally,
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.900]   I'm more of a comedy Jew than a finance do.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:43.400]   So like finance often goes way over my head, but but financial regulation is kind of its own beast.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.500]   But yeah, like, I know, I know people want the government to go after him.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.700]   And if there's financial issues, sure, but with the antitrust stuff, that's something I get less where they're like,
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:58.000]   Oh, he can't, he can't buy Twitter because that's too much like to have this, all these companies and Twitter.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.300]   And I'm like, Twitter is a lot smaller than like, it's not like he's buying Google.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.300]   That would be, I think, maybe a different conversation.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.300]   Twitter's, you know, Twitter's revenue is roughly equivalent to that of the olive garden.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.000]   Literally, I'm not making that up.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.700]   And no free bread, no bread stick.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.300]   So it's not you're right.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.800]   And what does it have to do with cars and space and boring holes under Las Vegas?
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.300]   Nothing.
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.300]   So I don't think there's any regulatory issue.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.900]   I guess it has to be approved as any merger of that size has to be.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.900]   But I don't murder.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.600]   It's a purchase.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.400]   Is there a result?
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.000]   It's technically a merger.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.800]   I think that's what Twitter's calling it as a merger.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.200]   What?
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:36.800]   How?
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   A merger with what?
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.700]   A merger with, I don't know, Twitter and the Elan's money.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.600]   That's what it is.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.200]   Right.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.400]   I don't know.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:45.900]   I don't know.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.100]   Well, whatever it is, who Pemoji is.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:55.300]   I mean, it's a purchase, obviously, but don't we still have another at least five months of the shenanigans to deal with?
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.200]   And let's say it'll take about six months.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.400]   So depressing.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.200]   You know what?
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.500]   The longer this goes on, the less likely people are to change Section 230 flash.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.300]   We're in the Internet.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.700]   So I'm like, all right.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.700]   Actually, that is part of this, isn't it?
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.500]   Because Elan has said that we've talked a lot about it over the last six weeks.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:19.300]   It feels like long that he wants quote free speech, but no spam.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:28.100]   He's he doesn't and Section 230 says that you can moderate all you want.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.800]   But he says, well, they should never have kicked Donald Trump off.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.900]   They shouldn't moderate.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.200]   Sounds like he wants a moderation free zone.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:42.000]   After what happened in Buffalo this week, egged on considerably by 4chan.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.600]   I think you could see the end game of no moderation.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.800]   That's not what we want.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:58.200]   Yeah, but also like, Elan doesn't seem to know what he wants for moderation, like at all, just all together because he was praising the EU standard and he was saying, yeah, we need to get rid of all this speed.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.700]   But not this speech, but also first amendment standard.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:08.000]   He also had this strange conception that like whatever speech a government allows is free speech.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.600]   And I'm like, you know how that's a certain country.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:18.800]   That means it seemed like the whole EU praising was just a way to get them to shut up and get off his back.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.100]   So.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.700]   Was that what that was?
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.000]   Seems like it because he's he's going to figure him out.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.900]   What's it do? You know, it's like, all right, y'all, let me pacify you for a minute so y'all could stop talking about me.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.100]   Right.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.200]   Meanwhile, I'm going to go over here and just continue to ruin the social platforms.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.900]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:42.500]   Well, and also Sam's free speech like I don't I don't know how he's going to, you know, buy the free speech standard.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:48.600]   I'm going to say like, I mean, I'm not sure if you all have gotten this, but for years, my DMS were full of hello, my dear.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.200]   And it was like romance scam starts.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.500]   I met with him and it was very fun and I kind of miss.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.000]   You actually met with them. You went and I missed.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.200]   Oh, you said you said you met with them.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.500]   I thought that's brave.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.300]   You went to Nigeria for that or wow.
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.200]   Yeah, I get a lot of I get those two, by the way, so.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   You should reply to them.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.100]   It's really fun.
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.400]   I've gotten some very, very angry, but one that when you play with, yeah.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:21.600]   But one was telling me to download an app and I'm like, all right, I'll I'll do this, but first tell me what's an app.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.900]   So then I'm like, Google this and I'm like, what's cool?
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.700]   And then we keep going and eventually I'm like, so it's inside my phone.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.100]   Should I crack my phone open with a hammer?
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.700]   And they're like, good question.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.500]   No.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.700]   Well, they want somebody dumb.
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:43.100]   So they at first they probably loved it and then they started to realize you're playing them some.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:50.800]   So the Texas social media law, which I think we all agree is insane.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:57.000]   And but of course it is probably going to be the law.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.500]   The Fifth Circuit has blocked the blockage, what he has lifted the injunction.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:18.200]   Now a couple of tech industry groups, net choice and the CCIA have filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court asking to stay the lift of the injunction,
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.000]   which in other words, to keep the law from going into effect.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.500]   Last week we were talking about this.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:38.800]   I can't remember if it was Mike Masnick who said that unfortunately the Fifth Circuit's guy on the Supreme Court, the guy who would rule on this in the shadow docket is none other than the wonderful justice Alito.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.900]   So I'm not sure it appealed to the Supreme Court for an emergency injunction.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.300]   Well, the other thing is in the legislation itself, I forget who it was.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:59.400]   I just said this week, Mike, but Masnick, because Masnick says all things, is that within the law itself, it negates itself because federal law supersedes it and Section 230 supersedes it.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.000]   So it's the law that isn't, that isn't.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.700]   It's an NFT of laws.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.000]   Right.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.800]   Net choice is CCIA.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:13.600]   Say Texas, the Texas law is unconstitutional, which it obviously is because it essentially amounts to the government compelling a private business to carry speech.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.200]   They otherwise would remove the First Amendment prohibits Texas.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:28.600]   They say from forcing online platforms to host and promote foreign propaganda, pro Nazi speech and spam left standing HB 20.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.900]   The Texas law will turn the First Amendment on his head.
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.200]   That's one way to put it.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.500]   I think it might be doing something worse.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:42.600]   I almost hate people saying, but what about Texas, Section 230 because I hate it.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.600]   I feel like don't mention we don't talk about Section 230.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.600]   Don't bring it up because that just gives people more ammunition to go after it.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.300]   You're a fight on it.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.300]   Yeah, true.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:57.000]   Shoshana, what is the chance that the Supreme Court will strike down HB 20?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.200]   Yeah, like on a larger panel on stuff Gorsuch has said like Gorsuch understand I'm a big Gorsuch fan, usually.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.500]   We agree on a lot.
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.000]   He likes licensing reform.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.200]   He's like alluded to it.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.700]   So I'm like, we're vibing here, you and me Gorsuch.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.100]   He also likes unenumerated rights, which I'm very excited about.
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:24.300]   And I think to look at this and know this is dumb, Kavanaugh's had opinions in the past where like he recognizes how Section 230 works and he also understands like the dynamic of this stuff.
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.700]   I don't know the other justices.
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.600]   Judge Jackson was talking about in her confirmation hearing.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.700]   She was at about 230 and she seemed to have a pretty good grasp on how everything works around here.
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:42.900]   It's so hard to say how they'll apply to a state law, but I mean a lot of the standards around the stuff that are going to be strict scrutiny.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.500]   And like I'm not a huge fan of the rational basis test, especially when applied to unenumerated rights.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:55.500]   So like I extra appreciate strict scrutiny because it's like the Supreme Court doing its job to review government actions and its first amendment.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:12.700]   So I think it'll be okay, but like you never know, I mean the Supreme Court gives us horrible surprises now and then so I'm like, I hope, but I mean, the one thing that I'm sure of is that I think it's a really good use of government money to spend throwing this through
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.900]   the court defending it.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.600]   Just the whole process.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.300]   This was really, really worth taxpayer dollars.
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:25.900]   So it would be up to Alito whether the court would take the case on.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:34.500]   He has the right at this point to unilaterally say, no, we're going to let the Fifth Circuit's decision stand and that would be that until the case comes to.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.000]   Court, do you think is what you didn't mention Alito?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.600]   Is he pro 230?
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   Does he.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.300]   Good question.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.800]   I'm sure he's an enumerated rights guy.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:50.600]   Yeah, he's not with me on an enumerated rights and I don't even just mean like the abortion case.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.200]   I think there's a real deeper theory there that that people tend to ignore and only see abortion.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.100]   Well, for me, it's the right term of living.
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.600]   That's an unenumerated right that's been giving me more protection.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.800]   There's all kinds there.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.500]   But I'm a buster is an unenumerated right to let's get rid of that.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.400]   First amendment.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.900]   Is that count as an enumerated right?
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.400]   Yes.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.400]   Oh, enumerated not unenumerated, but section 230 enumerated merely means it's mentioned specifically in the Constitution.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.700]   Yeah, yeah, they wrote it down.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.800]   And the Ninth Amendment says just because we didn't write it down doesn't mean don't attack it.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:30.700]   They get the same protection and then you had judges for like decades being like, I'm going to ignore that now and just kind of do what I want.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.700]   So I'm big on on like unenumerated rights theory that it deserves the same protection.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:45.300]   But like we're talking about fundamental rights with this case, like the free speech, which I think it's the, you know, I don't think it should be treated differently than unenumerated rights, but it is.
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.600]   So it's harder for the court to mess it up.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:54.200]   It doesn't mean they won't, but it's definitely like less likely that you're going to look at their decision and stress out.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.400]   But you know, for it still depends if a leader is going to do something beforehand.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.400]   I haven't read him on tech law.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.600]   I know him on certain areas, but not this.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.600]   So I'm just hoping he won't disappoint us.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.100]   Oh, it'll be very interesting.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:12.300]   And in a way, something that chatroom is saying there's something wrong with me.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.800]   I want to watch the world burn in a way.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.700]   I feel the same way.
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.900]   I kind of I kind of want to say make it a law.
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.200]   Let's see what happens.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.400]   Be very interesting to see what happens.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:31.300]   What would the consequences of the HP 20 be would Twitter can't say we're not going to operate in Texas?
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.200]   Yeah, they can.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.500]   They can find some way.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.800]   Can they?
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.900]   That's what yeah, I mean, it's going to be imperfect.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.700]   It's going to be IP and somebody will get around it.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.300]   It's a ha I'm in Texas and I got you Twitter.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.000]   But it's good.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.100]   But yeah, they can they can.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.900]   I mean, Facebook pulled its news from Australia.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.600]   But Texas is it's Texas is from the state.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.300]   It's Spain.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:19:03.800]   It's not a good guy, but it'd be really interesting then is, you know, it becomes a warning shot to companies.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.200]   But God knows with this Twitter administration and this board, who knows who knows what's happened.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.000]   They'll put that one.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.600]   You know, it's going to move to Texas.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.400]   So God knows.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.000]   Well, it may be more to the point.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.800]   Facebook would also have to get out of Texas, wouldn't it?
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.700]   Facebook's is big that big or maybe not.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.700]   But how do they do that with the law saying they can't stop operating there?
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.600]   Just because of the law.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.100]   Like the law specifically says you have to continue to operate in Texas.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.500]   Like functionally, maybe there's a way around it, but I'm not.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.300]   I'm not sure how they do that.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.400]   It's crazy.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.700]   You could make people coming here from Texas and them to buy you by saying that you won't do anything.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.400]   And then if they don't do it, then you put it up.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:42.900]   Right here.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.700]   Yeah, but you can't get in unless you have a lawyer or give you a blood signed oath.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.000]   You know, that kind of stuff.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.500]   So how do you feel about cookies and would you sign this blood oath?
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.500]   It's perfect.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.500]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:52.700]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.300]   That's a lot of blood though.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.900]   I mean, like then you have to get the you have to get health authorities involved.
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.100]   I'm just that's extra layers that I'm not sure they'd be willing to take on for that.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.400]   They might just stop moderating.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.000]   That's what I'm wondering is maybe they would just say, okay, fine.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.400]   Texas gets to give us your give us your first born now that you're required by law to have it.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:11.900]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.600]   You know, oh jeez.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.200]   Okay.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.000]   Too soon.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   But first born to then you have to get other agencies involved.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.500]   Like it's things like all you're getting more regulatory complexity.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.300]   And I don't think it makes anything easier.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.200]   This is the world we live in.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.400]   No wonder you live in a half fantasy world.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:29.900]   Shoshata.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.000]   It's called Washington.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:31.500]   Now.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.700]   Don't tell her it's a fantasy.
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.200]   I think she.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:33.700]   Oh, okay.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.500]   Bob.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.800]   We got them.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.000]   I mean, I live here with my husband and I go out West a lot.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   But I'm not sure what you mean by fantasy.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:21:01.400]   Mike actually has an interesting piece in Mondays, a tech dirt that Twitch could have actually violated the Texas social media law by pulling down the livestream of the Buffalo.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.200]   Murder spree because that's moderating.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.800]   That gives you some reason to pause.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.100]   It's just also stupid.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:20.100]   It's it's it's such a bad law that you almost want to see what would happen if they tried to enforce it.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:27.200]   I just I sometimes I think people make these laws much like the social media law in Florida.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.400]   And of course, the Florida says you can't protest in front of justices homes, even though there are no justice.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.000]   I feel like they make these laws to get media.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.500]   It's a political statement is rolling.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.200]   It is troll.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.100]   It's not a troll.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.000]   That's too nice to them.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.500]   It's trolling.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.800]   Yeah, I can't think of a better use of legislative time than trolling though.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   Like I'm not sure what else it would make sense to do.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.900]   What would you do if you didn't troll right?
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.800]   So Governor Ducey has been doing like, you know, like letting people from other states work in Arizona.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:11.700]   And he's done he had a law that actually got me interested in him years ago saying that state and local governments could not use government money to pay lobbyists that they hire to lobby government itself because that's silly and duplicative.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:18.700]   But really, instead of doing that, I wonder what he could have done and what he could have accomplished if he just tried to troll a little bit harder.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:25.100]   We want 10% of the money that we pay to the lobbyists to lobby us.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.000]   We want 10% actually you could really really make some money on that.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.700]   I believe I think that's a violation of quantum mechanics.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.600]   But I think you can make money on that.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.400]   The charge.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:41.100]   You can you have a material cockoo like can you check it straight theory would be very very helpful in this.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:51.500]   I had a question about this whole with the Buffalo shooting and the way the government went after Twitch.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:23:00.600]   How fast are we expecting the moderation to be able to jump into the live stream and kill it?
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:08.100]   You know, well, the thing is interesting about the Twitch is I think only I think I saw the number 40 people saw that's just thought there there.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:16.400]   But as soon as it was pulled down, it was reproduced everywhere and millions 40 million people something like that saw it subsequently.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.200]   There's that Streisand effect.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.400]   Right, but it's so but people are yelling at the social media platforms as if it was.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.800]   Twitch is not Twitch's fault, you know, no.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.100]   It's not.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:34.700]   Yeah, and one thing that gets me to is that like obviously platforms don't want the stuff on them.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:48.300]   Sometimes they don't act fast enough, but I never understand politicians who genuinely think that their business model is to have like the worst stuff like this and monetize it because that's it's functionally not how it works like it doesn't benefit them to have it on the platform.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.200]   It's just grandstanding because it's primary season.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.400]   More trolling pain.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.000]   It's just pain for me.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.600]   I'm always in pain from this like politicians just not knowing how the internet works.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.800]   Let's see.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.200]   I think I've speaking of speaking of the video though.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.900]   I think it was the I put a story in there that I found really interesting.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.200]   This is from garbage day.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.000]   Exactly.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.500]   Email.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.500]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.700]   You can't always blame algorithms.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:23.100]   So here's the Tim.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:28.300]   Tim Kane did a tweet saying, you know, for never mind Fox News, never mind Tucker Carlson, never mind whatever.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:34.200]   Actually, everybody's finally talking about Tim Kane, find their way up and says big tech, go to Bing Tech and algorithms.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:40.600]   And then this is why what used to be known as a blogger is now known as a newsletter or writes.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.700]   I'm forgetting his name suddenly that, you know, it all came in fourth.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.800]   And the point of four.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.000]   And is that it's ephemeral.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.200]   There's no there's no amplification.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.000]   There's no algorithm involved at all.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And so this idea that let's let's get rid of all the algorithms because that's what's corrupting society.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.500]   Sorry guys, not in this way, around TV and it's four.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.200]   And meeting and and I know I'm sorry, Tim Kane.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.500]   I don't think you could call four.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.500]   Chan big tech.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.800]   No, you can't.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.500]   No, you can't.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.900]   We must stop the tweets.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:16.300]   We must stop big tech from propagating big lies that lead to carnage.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.200]   I don't think anybody in big tech wants replacement theory propagated.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.600]   He clearly had no idea.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.000]   No, no idea.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.300]   It was an easy it was an easy thing.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:41.200]   Son of a it's really frustrating though on, but especially because like you're saying, like the bad stuff comes on other forms that have has nothing to do with algorithms and algorithms just go for what people want anyway and try to mitigate the harms.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.700]   But like, I mean, I am still kind of floored that I remember the video game, moral panic when I was a kid.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.600]   I remember that.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.900]   But then like looking back and remembering that Congress was basically having hearings on seven pixels.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.000]   I just can't like trust them on anything when it comes to like these moral panics.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.300]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.700]   I'm doing re researching right now, moral panic.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.300]   So watch out.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.800]   Watch out and get your finger ready.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.600]   I've been.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.200]   You know, the same things.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.400]   Who's who's.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:10.900]   Adam.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:11.600]   Adam.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.400]   Theorer at Mercatus has a tunnel work.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.300]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.100]   I'm glad you know him already, but he's.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:17.600]   Yeah, he's great.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:23.400]   I need to read his moral panic work so I can, you know, understand so I can moral panic or I'm well, but.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:23.800]   Yes.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.400]   But I so I've saved things.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:37.600]   I've saved bookmarks to moral panic since 2017 and it's just it's just, you know, my favorite of all of them is that sex toys could kill.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.300]   Have they?
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.000]   I don't think so.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.500]   I haven't seen anything, but they could.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.500]   Would be a whole cyber sex toys could be the death of us.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.300]   Yeah, I'm willing to try just out of experimental purposes.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:54.900]   Okay.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.300]   A little dangerously.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:56.700]   They are.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.500]   Yeah, I'm at it.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.400]   So I'm a I'm a chance.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.600]   I'm a chance risk taker.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:00.800]   Right.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.200]   All right.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.600]   Boy, let's see books can kill you too, says Burke.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.000]   Bullocks can kill.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   We know that.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.200]   Yeah, people don't kill people.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.500]   People do people.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   The ideas are what kill people.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:19.900]   And the and yeah, yeah, I don't think big tech is the problem.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:20.500]   Tim came.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.000]   Sorry.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.500]   It's hard for me to think that that's the issue.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.700]   I'm trying to get through.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.500]   I don't know.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.100]   I'm going on and on through Elon Musk stuff.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.700]   I'm trying to.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.500]   There's like mother on the on the sports illustrated swimsuit cover.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.100]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.400]   Elon Musk is on the cover of sports.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.600]   The mother, his mother, his mother is.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.800]   Literally Jordan Peterson.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   Oh, just a woman for way too much on the S.I.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.700]   cover and left.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.400]   Yeah, 70 some.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.000]   She looks really good.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.300]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.700]   Love the palm tree earrings too.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.200]   Yeah, those are fun.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:54.700]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.500]   Yes.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:55.900]   I.
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:00.200]   First of all, why is there still a sports illustrated swimsuit issue?
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:09.100]   And I guess they're trying to paper over the the the flaw in the concept by putting like a variety of other women.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.600]   That you wouldn't normally put.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.300]   I mean, it's just hopeless.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.900]   You can't now owned by us.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.100]   I was now owned by another content factory like all the other time.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.400]   And magazines are now owned by dot dash.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.000]   Did you ever see this story this week is a big story this week?
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.400]   The latest report is that people magazine not long ago, the most profitable magazine on earth.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.800]   They fooled its print edition just like he did.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.400]   Wow.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.200]   People people people.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.800]   What are you going to look at when you're in the grocery store and exactly people read people.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.400]   Elisa reads people, but she's you know, more and more.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.400]   She's reading it digitally in Apple news.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.900]   So maybe that's her fault.
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.500]   He said people wouldn't go away.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.500]   They would just be digital only to be noticed.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:50.700]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:51.100]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:57.100]   That's that's that's the that's the that's the that's the new death with regards to that sports illustrated swimsuit.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:02.800]   Shout out to hands on photography episode number 95, Miss Loretta Houston.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.100]   She was one of the photographers.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.300]   She's the photographer for the whole thing.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:10.300]   Oh, which episode episode 95.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.700]   Does she talk about it at all?
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.700]   Yeah, we we go into it how Tyra Banks got her the opportunity.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.000]   Nice.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.900]   Our banks found her on Instagram and gave her an opportunity and it just blew it.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.500]   Wow.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.300]   Netflix hit by a hundred fifty layoffs.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:37.800]   It feels like Netflix is panicking lose a couple hundred thousand subscribers and now it's all over and time to fire people.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   Now they're eleven thousand employees.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:57.100]   But it feels like they're panicking, but their whole model of it is put billions on on entertainment and I think they're trying to to position themselves to be able to pay all of those millions of people, not millions of people thousands of those thousands of people that they gave huge contracts.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.600]   You know, oh for the movies.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.000]   Yes.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:05.600]   All of that content they didn't just throw a cheap number up there like Shonda rhymes on say she got almost 50 million.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.200]   I think they already paid them though, right?
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.800]   No, she's not waiting for the check still.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.400]   No, but I'm saying is this they made a big investment in.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:17.000]   Oh, I think they remember thirteen billion dollars last year's on content.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.600]   I mean a lot of that growth was fueled by the pandemic pandemics over people are going outside.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   No, it's not.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.700]   No, it's not.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:29.700]   Oh, OK, people are going outside with it.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.900]   We have a monkey pox now monkey pox is in ways in Massachusetts.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:39.700]   By the way, is monkey pox related to COVID or something completely different and something whole new thing to worry about.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.500]   Oh boy.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:48.500]   All right, I'm going to look this up because I don't want you to spread which monkeys in Massachusetts started it.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:52.800]   I think it was released by the monkeys intentionally.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.900]   It's a small Massachusetts confirms case of monkey pox.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.500]   I tweeted one of the doctors I trust on the topic.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.700]   This is it from ABC News.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.600]   I don't want to show you the pictures disgusting.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   A Massachusetts resident has tested positive for monkey pox.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:20.100]   The first case of the rare virus in the United States this year shades of February 2020 when we were saying, oh, yes, there's a snoo flu in China.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.900]   Is it transmit?
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:28.400]   Angela Ricebessen who's who Angie underscore Raspus and who's one of the experts I trust from my COVID list.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.200]   It's transmitted by aerosol and direct contact.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:39.700]   It's not easily transmissible person to person requires close physical proximity and move away a little bit.
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.800]   I think he's risky.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.700]   The patient is an adult male who recently traveled to Canada.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.400]   There is your Canada, right?
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:47.900]   Canada.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.900]   You should be OK.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:54.500]   And that has been a message to the Department of Public Health says the case poses no risk to the public.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.400]   The individual is hospitalized and in good condition.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.800]   Don't worry.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.700]   Good old panic monkey pox hit the moral hit the ball.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:09.700]   And a monkey pox is a rare disease caused by the appropriately enough monkey pox virus.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.300]   Yeah, I didn't mean to get us off.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.300]   I think we don't have to worry about monkey pox.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.900]   So we still got to worry about COVID is not overly.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.600]   No, but from the point of view of Netflix, it is.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.000]   Well, anyway, Netflix.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.500]   They see the right in on the wall with all of those subscriptions dropping and not are talking about different ways to pivot.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:38.300]   They did say they did say in their quarterly results that they anticipate millions of subscribers lost in the next quarter.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.900]   So they do see a lay on avalanche coming.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:47.900]   But I think they had this is what we're seeing now in general in tech industry.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.900]   There were steep growths over the last two years.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:55.200]   Tech industry garnered trillions of dollars in windfall profits from COVID.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.400]   And now it's over.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:57.600]   Yep.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.600]   And so next move.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:09.900]   Well, with monkey pox, I think there's some hope that monkey could start using the internet more like we were over the past few years.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:15.400]   So I think the solution here is for tech companies to send phones to monkeys.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:19.800]   And Netflix should not ignore the vast and growing monkey population.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.900]   You're absolutely right, Shoshana.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.500]   It's a real opportunity.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.000]   Yes.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.700]   See, that's what I call taken lemons and making lemonade.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.800]   Yeah, brilliant.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   Yeah, brilliant.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.400]   There's always a bright side to everything, including monkey pox.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:34.800]   All right.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.400]   See, the rights of monkeys are not enumerated in the Constitution.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.000]   It's right.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   They have enumerated freedom, enumerated monkey pox.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.900]   It happens.
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.800]   So Netflix with ads.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.900]   Good idea, bad idea.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.800]   Thanks for getting us back here.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.000]   What do you do?
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.400]   I think the idea for Netflix is we want to make a lower cost subscription available.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.600]   People who don't want to pay what is it now?
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.700]   14, $15.
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.700]   And that's got to be one of the reasons the subscribers are dropping, right?
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:08.300]   If we have an $8 one like Hulu does, we have a five or an $8 plan and you're going to have to watch some ads.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.300]   I think that they're hoping that will work.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.900]   Plus their programming was all at all depressing.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.000]   It was all dark.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.200]   It was really dark.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.200]   They're in 2020.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.000]   Never find anything like cheery in the midst of a pandemic.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.500]   A lot of the content was dark.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.200]   Then 20.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.200]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.300]   Meanwhile, Hulu is where you can find King of the Hill.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:33.400]   I have been, just and I admitted watching a lot more Hulu lately.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.500]   So maybe that's true.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.500]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.000]   You know what?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.900]   Bob's burger too.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.900]   I like Bob's burger.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.100]   I think my Netflix is.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.000]   She's good.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.600]   She's good.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.400]   I told you.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.000]   She's good.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.100]   Netflix.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:48.500]   Yes.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:53.900]   The most amazing pivot in the history, the modern history of media, right?
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:35:05.300]   What other company shifted from mailing you red envelopes to becoming fully digital and gigantic and what it went just used to just ship stuff and then made stuff.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.200]   Maybe it was a phenomenal pivot.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.500]   They were laughed at.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.600]   It's like, why are you?
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.400]   I can't has only somebody lives, you know?
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.100]   Maybe you pivot again.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:14.600]   Maybe.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.500]   And what do you pivot to?
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.100]   Two.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:17.500]   That's the thing.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.100]   They're not pivoted.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.500]   I think this is Ann's point.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:19.900]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.100]   Was it your they're not pivoting to anything right now except panic.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.500]   Right.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.400]   It's a panic pivot.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.600]   I'm just trying to figure out what to do next.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.500]   Not easy.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.200]   Actually.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:29.700]   No.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.300]   No.
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.300]   Not sure what I do.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.800]   It's very expensive to create original programming.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.600]   Honestly, I think Hulu needs to improve their app.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.900]   I think that by itself, the worst app on television.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.100]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.900]   Hulu's bad to actually come to think of it.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:50.200]   Also, they will let me record brief clips to make gifts and like I'm I'm just.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   I ended by that.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.200]   I don't think so.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:53.700]   Let me.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.100]   That's very short sighted.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.700]   I go to a museum and occasionally go to an older museum and this.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.400]   No pictures.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.700]   No, Instagramming.
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.000]   The hip modern ones go Instagram.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Here's the grammable.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.800]   It's promoting us.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.500]   You know, why wouldn't you allow people to make clips to promote it?
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.100]   Maybe their contracts with the creators are limited, but they should redo those then.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:13.900]   Oh, foggy.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:17.800]   So they used to let you do King of the Hill clips and you can't do that anymore.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.700]   Yeah, just through a screen recorder.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.000]   Now they block that and all I'm asking is just for like 30 seconds.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.600]   Like I'm not like I'm not doing the whole thing, but 30 seconds.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.300]   I'm throwing on a Hulu logo.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:33.900]   You know, that's that's just good branding because my gifts actually my gifts get very good traction on Giffy.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.700]   So they're they're wasting branding opportunity.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.000]   Do you wait a minute now, art?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.700]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.000]   Yeah, now we got to go and done for you.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.400]   Take a break.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.500]   I was like, this is the this is the new the Giffy cottage industry.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.700]   I think this is very exciting.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.800]   I'd like to know you have a favorite.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.400]   Do you have a best Giffy gift?
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.100]   You've ever made?
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.900]   There's just a lot of really good ones lately.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:07.600]   I've been a fan of Homer Simpson when he's sleeping in a hammock and a and a caterpillar crawls into his mouth and he coughs out of butterfly like that's that's really, you know.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.200]   Does Giffy allow you like you have a like, oh, yeah, you do.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.300]   Yeah, you have an account.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.700]   You're an account on Giffy and you can.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:23.100]   Yeah, for gifts, mainly ones that like people people don't have like it's not easily Googleable.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:28.900]   Or it's one that I've created and I have trouble finding they have millions of views and I'm just like, all right.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:29.800]   I mean, I needed this.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.400]   So maybe you need this gift to, but you can't monetize your Giffy views.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:40.100]   No, I don't really monetize stuff that much on the capitalist, but like I'm really bad.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:45.300]   But my favorite kind, by the way, talk, I think we should have more really bad.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.200]   It's very real.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:38:01.200]   But I'm working with the Sloth Institute and one of my projects that I've wanted to do with them is to get their cute videos of sloths and make gifts and always have their logo on it so then people can go back and then be like, oh, I should donate to the sloth Institute.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:01.800]   Of course.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.900]   Wait a minute, like like sloths like like the animals sloths and trees.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.000]   Yep.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.400]   Is this a is this a political act?
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.400]   Is this on K Street?
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.600]   Is it a political action?
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.300]   No, this is another thing.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.200]   Okay.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:26.700]   They're based in Costa Rica and I always thought it would be really freaking funny if I got to be an associate fellow at the Sloth Institute and I kept tweeting them like, hey, like, what if I was an associate fellow with you.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:31.100]   So I am and I actually do government research for this and help out social media.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:35.500]   Why are you still, you know, let's put that in your lower third.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.600]   I know.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.300]   Look at them.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.500]   Look at my loss.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.900]   They actually do.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:47.000]   Great video of a sloth, a sloth being being reunited with its babies.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Oh, I was, I just saw that it was so cute.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.400]   The sloth.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.900]   Wasn't that what's really sad is they always look like they're smiling.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:00.800]   I mean, that's why I love them because they're just always smiling at you, but they're not really smiling.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.300]   They're smiling.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.500]   It's really sad, but they do amazing work to stop sloth electrocutions.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.300]   They hang from stuff.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.100]   The wires there aren't well insulated.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.900]   So they're actually working on stopping it and lots of sloths die that way.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:18.100]   They rehabilitate and my first meeting with them, they were, you know, setting up and they're like, well, we're getting this ready.
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.800]   We'll just put the camera in front of this baby's law.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.700]   So I'm just sitting for a couple of minutes talking to them watching a baby.
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.100]   Oh, I'd be so happy that would be.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.500]   I would just say, can I call you tomorrow?
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.900]   I'd like to, we'd like to do more of this.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.900]   Oh, right.
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.300]   Like that when you said this.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.300]   Wait, wait, wait, there's sloth.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:36.700]   Birch.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:37.300]   OK, come on.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.900]   You know, you got to buy some sloth birch.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.700]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.100]   All right.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:40.600]   All right.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.500]   Let's see what we get.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.300]   Let's get a month worse on this show.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.100]   I've spent many, many dollars on bad sloth stuff.
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.500]   Oh, sloth mug would be good.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.800]   Oh, tell me about it.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.400]   I don't believe what I'm seeing.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.900]   Oh, I love sloths.
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:01.700]   You know, though, they're making a mistake because honestly, cartoon sloths are less cute than the real thing.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:02.700]   I want a real sloth.
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.500]   Yeah, maybe they have rights problems, you know.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   So I see they're all into veganism.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.200]   People don't eat sloths, do they?
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.700]   No, I'm also actually a vegetarian.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.600]   I'm a kosher vegetarian and my diet sucks because my body is falling apart.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.200]   I have like lots of diseases.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.400]   So like I can't eat like anything.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.000]   It's fine.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.800]   Like it's fine, but like it sucks to be a kosher vegetarian who can't have chickpeas or cauliflower like that.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.700]   So yeah, but yeah, it sucks.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.800]   But as far as I know, people donate.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.900]   They don't eat sloths.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.800]   Yeah, thankfully chickpeas.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.000]   Like is that how I know?
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.900]   She's really sick.
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.200]   Yeah, I figured out when I was sick.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:43.700]   I know.
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.300]   That's horrible.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:44.800]   That's really.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.700]   Oh, it's OK.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:48.300]   It's a beautiful thing.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:52.000]   I know every now and then I'm like, maybe I can have it now.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.400]   And then I'm like, oh my gosh, I cannot have chickpeas now.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400]   It's really bad.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:55.900]   It's good.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:56.300]   It's good.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.800]   I'm just not October.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.900]   We have to do a thing on October 20th.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.100]   It's international sloth day.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:02.600]   All right.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   And maybe we could do something to celebrate.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.700]   Mr. Jerry, put it on the calendar.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.200]   Put that on the calendar.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.800]   I just want I just want it on the record here that as someone who takes this show down rabbit holes,
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.600]   Shoshana has beat my record already.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.400]   Yeah, test the way into the show.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:23.200]   They actually celebrate International Sloth Day with sloth toberfest.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:34.400]   So a couple of years ago, I was giving a talk with governor, Ducey at Alec and and it was us to add a dinner on it.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   And I ended it letting him know that Texas is the Texas is beating Arizona.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.800]   The Texas is the only state in the country that has a three-toat sloth.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.200]   And I asked him what he was going to do to get more three-toat sloths to Arizona.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.800]   So if you think I take you guys down rabbit hole, just know that like I do for a living.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   Well, the big sloth deficit is something I think all Arizonans are concerned about.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   Yeah, that's a serious issue.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.000]   Let me let's take a little break.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   As if we have it.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.400]   Shoshana Weisman is with us.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   She's great.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:18.000]   Not only a policy head at the sloth Institute, she's also head of digital media at RSI, a fellow there and a senator.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Shoshana from East Virginia on the Twitter.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Of course, Aunt Pruitt and Jeff Jarvis as well.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Our show today brought to you by Buck Mason.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Did you wear those?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   I am wearing my buck mason.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   You're wearing my buck mason.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   I gave you a pair of, I don't call them britches pants.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   I gave you a pair of pants.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Do they fit?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   They fit.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   They feel great.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Oh, I love these magazines.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   I love my buck masons too.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   We all have our, you know, I wear work clothes.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   I wear, you know, blazer to work.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   You wear a t-shirt.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   I just show up.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   We all have work clothes.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   And I remember when I was a kid, my mom used to say, "Okay, take off your school clothes.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Put on your play clothes."
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Well, I love getting home.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   And even as a grown up, my play clothes are buck masons.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Shirt, sweaters, jeans.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   It's your go-to in the closet.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   You know, when you don't have to wear a suit and tie, when you get to wear what you want, you wear buck mason.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Buck masons closer.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Second to none.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Timeless and never go out of style.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   By the way, they have jackets too.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   I'm going to have to start working on my, the carry-on collection.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Isn't that great for your day trips or your overnight trips?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   Oh, I guess.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Gene's shirts, jackets.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   I love my britches.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   I don't think they call them britches.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   The t-shirts are famous for their t-shirts, by the way.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   The curved hem T and GQ calls it the best t-shirt in the game.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   And I would agree, they're really, really nice.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   They're tailored.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   They look good.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   They fit well.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And I wash them.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   I wash them every time.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   And they look just as good as the, with the day they arrived.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   I just love it.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   The cotton, the quality.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   The, how well made they are and makes buck mason a real standout in men's and women's clothing too.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Once you try buck mason, they'll become your go-tos too.

[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   I'm not advertising for anybody except my beautiful body.

[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   You're probably a hard guy to fit.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   That's the key.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   These are definitely Queen Pruitt approved because I put them on.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   You're so comfy.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   And she's like, "Ooh, don't look good on you."
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   So, yeah, because this is a hard time for all the britches to fit in.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   Not britches.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Are those sweatpants?
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   Are those buck mason britches?
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Oh, yeah, I could tell because the...
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Boy, you have massive thighs.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Yes, I do.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   But they fit.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   But they fit.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   And I could tell because the material's not thin.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   It's like solid and thick.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   It's heavy.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   It feels great.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   So, yes, I need to get some more of these.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Buckmason.com/tweg.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Thank you so much for supporting this week in Google.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   This is not a typical show.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   I'm so, so sorry.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   That's because you're here.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   It's self-fulfilling.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   I guess so.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   It wouldn't be a typical show of any kind of Shoshana's here.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   It's so nice to have you.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   We appreciate it.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Breaking this information in hot news?
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Yes.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   So, Charlie Wartz will just put it in the rundown at 155.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Okay.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Says that Costco disappeared.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   Did he already take it down?
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Hot.crash.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Oh, he killed it.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   He pulled it down.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   He didn't like it.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   What did he tweet?
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Tweets, you know, Costco's stock crashed 13% with a meme account that tweeted a fake headline
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   that Costco was raising the price of its hot dogs to inflation.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Oh, that's one of the few things that has not changed in years.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   The Buck 50.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   You got to wonder what it's made of because if you can't, if you don't raise the price.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Oh, it's like the Costco.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   You know what?
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Here's a secret.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   And I know you don't trust me because of the Casco Pepe and screw you for that.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   But the Costco chicken, the street, $5.00 or a district chicken is incredible.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Wonderful.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   So the stocks are tumbling.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   So the hot dog was the cause of this, the hot dog caused the fact that it was going to go off.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   The fake rise in price.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Fake.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Fake.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Right.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   So I will say it's not the first time that like a hot dog has been a big indicator of like the
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   direction of a company.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   I'm a big fan of the Snapchat hot dog because that was kind of like their plan to monetize.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.760]   They just, they're like, here's a dancing hot dog.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:13.680]   And I kind of feel this is very much the same thing where it's like hot dog, you know, company
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:14.680]   crash.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.680]   Like it just makes sense.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.760]   Oh, here's the Charlie just wanted to update his tweet.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.720]   The Charlie Wurzel tweet is here.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:26.080]   Oh, actually he's tweeting something debunking.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.840]   But look at, let me just show you that.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.080]   Yeah, but let me show you the stock.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:36.480]   It is, it has gone down 57 bucks in the past five days, 11%.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:40.040]   But is that because of this or is it because of the hot dog?
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.040]   I don't know.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.040]   I think it's the hot dog.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.840]   I really think it's the hot dog.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:52.720]   Like, you know, well, that would, you know, that would, that certainly would cause people
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:53.720]   to be concerned.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.120]   By the way, the chairman is performing the, they are Hebrew national hot dogs.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.120]   They're very good.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.120]   Oh, those are good.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.120]   They're good hot dogs.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.480]   They're not just a whole hot dogs.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   I guess it's a lot.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.200]   Do it hot dogs finance, you know, yeah.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.040]   I think it's a loss leader for them, right?
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.000]   They don't care what you pay for the hot dog because they know you're going to buy an
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.240]   eight or not buy a bag of taco chips.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.240]   Right.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.080]   20 pound bag chips.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.920]   So they're kind of okay.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:22.640]   The pizza looks like it's but the, oh, we also have just breaking, breaking Joel.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.080]   That because I got no news today.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.080]   What?
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:31.240]   It's a little, you know, Joelie B. No, who's Joelie B?
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.800]   Oh, Joelie B is the Korean chicken.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:34.800]   Get this.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.800]   It's a fry.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:42.880]   It's very, very beloved fried chicken franchise that also serves spaghetti with potato sauce.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.400]   I'm going to have to call you this.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.280]   I don't think this is breaking news.
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.840]   What the heck is this?
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.280]   I just, I just don't think this is breaking news.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.080]   Oh, now this is in my watch history.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:49:01.080]   What's the music?
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.560]   I don't know.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.800]   It's been set to other music.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.960]   It sounds like it's a zoo band.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:07.960]   All right.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   All right.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.960]   Sorry.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.960]   Step away from the Twitter.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.720]   I've got to, I've got to maintain my title here from Shoshana for, for, for, for, for,
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   rabbit holes.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.360]   You'll never win.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.440]   No, I think he's trying too hard.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.440]   Can't tell.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.440]   But see what you're doing to us?
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.440]   You go to Google's new headquarters.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:31.040]   Oh, like to go off about like how, about which of us is going to go down the most rabbit
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.040]   holes.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:37.800]   Like it's Google going to judge Google will judge because we never actually talk about
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.800]   it.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.680]   Let us say, consider, on a show named this week in Google.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.520]   I'll try to get us back to Google.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:48.040]   Here's the new giant tent that is the Google headquarters.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:52.000]   It's got a slide in the middle, but from like nowhere to nowhere.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.440]   It looks like, like maybe they're pushing edges down the slide or so.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.400]   That's like, it's a bush slide.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.400]   What is it?
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.360]   Clear story windows allow light of the desks, automated window shades that open and close.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:11.720]   They have to because the sun, I'm sure Google officially opens to yesterday their Bayview
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.440]   campus in Mountain View, California, 1.1 million square feet.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.440]   Wow.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.440]   Four buildings.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.440]   That's the size.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.960]   That's the size of a, of an Amazon warehouse.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:26.680]   They always say that if you're on the cover of Sports Illustrated, that's the curse.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.480]   That's the end of your career, right?
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:33.440]   And I think it's always been, it's often been said that big corporations that build overly
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:38.200]   fancy company headquarters, it's usually their last act.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.640]   But I think that this is not the case.
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.720]   Apple just built that billion dollar spaceship campus.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.320]   And people aren't going there to work.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.320]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.320]   That's beautiful.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.320]   It's beautiful.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.320]   It's empty.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.320]   It's cursed.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:55.040]   Google says it's going to invest nine and a half billion dollars in offices and data centers
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.040]   this year.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.800]   Data centers make sense.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:07.760]   This is Google's commitment, they say, according to fortune, to physical office space.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:13.600]   There's the front lobby, which is singularly ugly, if you ask me.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:20.080]   Like it's a, it's brutalist, the right word, it looks like concrete, but then there's balloons.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.080]   And it's very ugly.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.280]   Birthday concrete.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.120]   Yeah, birthday concrete.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.880]   That's it.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.120]   And then why are there, why are there plants at the time?
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:37.680]   It looks like the end of times and the concrete has been, you know, the plants have taken over
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   or something.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.960]   You can sit there and be watered or something.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.400]   Ah, interesting.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.920]   Okay.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.800]   This is what they call a dragon scale solar system.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   That's all solar panels.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:55.240]   That's called 90,000 silver solar panels generating 40% of their annual electricity for the campus.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.840]   Wow.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.800]   This is such a hodgepodge of styles.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.240]   There's, there's, and there's a huge like camel in the background there.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.240]   Blue camel.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:11.080]   Artwork from local artists is picked scenes of Bay Area ecology.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.080]   Red trees.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.120]   Yeah, I don't think we have those.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.600]   The ventilation system.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.800]   Oh, here's something interesting.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.800]   It uses 100% air.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.800]   Outside.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   Outside air.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.800]   Outside air.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.040]   It really isn't ventilating if you take it just from the inside.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.040]   I think it's good.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.040]   I think it's good.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.840]   100% of for COVID, which is still among us.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.160]   Just stop with that monkey box thing.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.640]   Bayview is 100% electric.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:41.280]   An effort to decrease carbon emissions as opposed to what?
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.280]   Natural gas.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.480]   Well, they also have coal.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.760]   They don't have, what you would call it, heat pumps.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:51.080]   In addition to collaborative and community areas at campus includes phone rooms and other
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.080]   private spaces.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:56.280]   Oh, this is that thing that we were talking about when privacy thing comes in.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:00.760]   Oh, look, there's a massage chair kind of peering out from behind the curtains.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.240]   It feels really like dirty.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.600]   It feels thrown together to be honest with you.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.440]   I'm sorry, but I don't know.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.040]   They've been building this forever.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.840]   They've been building this for four IOs.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.160]   What was wrong with the current Plex?
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.960]   It was just a small.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.800]   Yeah, the 11th.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:28.600]   They didn't build that Plex room for 11,000 employees who are not coming to work.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.960]   Yeah, but as I'm saying, what's the point of following through?
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.520]   Well, I guess they didn't know because it's not like they started building this.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.440]   Oh, that was literally for IOs again.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.400]   I was watching the construction.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.120]   I remember seeing the dirty lot couple of days ago.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:48.400]   It's the text biggest data breach.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.600]   I didn't even say sick of data breaches.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.760]   Did you know about this one?
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.200]   All data is going to get out.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.720]   Let's just know what this is.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:54:04.200]   The Irish Council for Civil Liberties talking about this real time bidding system.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.360]   When do you hear this actually?
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.360]   This is kind of stunning.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:13.280]   RTB is the biggest data breach ever recorded at Traxxon's, but not by hackers.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.720]   This is intentional.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:22.180]   Traxxon shares with people view online and their real world location, 294 billion times
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:27.880]   a day in the US, 197 billion times a day in Europe.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.080]   So get ready.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:37.920]   This is an estimate again from the ICCL per person per day across the US.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.680]   And by the way, if you live in Colorado, you're the worst, worst off of this.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:50.040]   If you live in Colorado, 987 RTB broadcasts a day per person.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:54.240]   That means your location data is particularly.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:55:00.400]   So RTB exposes people's data on average 747 times a day.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:09.880]   Google, the biggest player in the RTB system, allows 4th, get ready for this 4,698 companies
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:15.680]   to retrieve data about the people in the US, your location data.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.440]   Microsoft, which ramped up its involvement in RTB in December when it bought AgTech firm
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:28.600]   Zander from AT&T, may send data to 1,647 companies.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:34.480]   Privacy and security concerns have been raised about RTB for years, especially in Europe,
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:43.640]   but awareness is arising in the US.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:53.680]   The real time bidding systems use of web users' interviews or info for tracking and ad targeting.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.920]   Businesses business clearly.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:01.640]   Again, I don't honestly, I've said this before, I don't really care if a company buys
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:06.440]   this to target me with advertising, that seems to me to be a minor hazard.
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:09.640]   But we now know that it's not just companies, it's law enforcement.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:13.400]   In Texas, it could just be your neighbor trying to figure out if you went to an abortion clinic
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:15.960]   recently so he could sue you.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:23.920]   This is becoming, the warning went out if this Roe v. Wade decision goes through the Supreme
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:29.360]   Court, you should probably not use a period tracking app.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:34.160]   Is that information could be sold on to somebody who would take advantage of it and prosecute
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.160]   you?
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.480]   Those apps have had leaks.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.160]   I think Flow is the one that had a real big date a leak.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:46.920]   One thing that I actually love related to this is Senator Ron Wyden, who created 230.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:52.120]   I was in Oregon giving a speech and I'm like, "Ron Wyden created 230, but they can talk
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.120]   to you."
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.120]   230 fan girl.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.120]   No, I know Ron Wyden too.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.120]   He has a big deal.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:03.740]   He has a bill that would stop government from buying data to get around third party doctrine
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:04.840]   holes, which I love.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.080]   I think that's a great idea because it's like, "Oh, we can't have a warrant.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.240]   We'll just buy the data."
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.840]   That's not acceptable.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.440]   It's crazy to me.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.600]   I'm open to a federal privacy law.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.640]   Our street works on this issue.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.560]   I also think it's what you're saying.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:23.160]   It's more dangerous for the government to be able to have this stuff, to be able to buy
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:26.440]   its way out of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.960]   Those holes are there.
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:32.840]   It's crazy to me that government isn't like, "Hey, this seems like a real hazard here.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.400]   Maybe we take care of this."
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:39.080]   It's just Ron Wyden and his co-sponsors off in their corner being like, "Hey, we're trying
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.080]   to fix this.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.280]   Maybe we want to do this."
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:47.000]   The Irish Council for Sibber Liberties goes on to say there's no way to restrict the use
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.280]   of RTB data after its broadcast.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:54.520]   Data brokers used it to profile Black Lives Matter protesters.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:58.680]   The US Department of Homeland Security and other agencies used it for warrantless phone
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.040]   tracking.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:04.880]   It was implicated in the outing of a gay Catholic priest through his use of grinder.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:14.480]   ICL uncovered the sale of RTB data revealing likely survivors of sexual abuse.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.480]   This is horrific.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:19.720]   It's not the kind of data breach we usually talk about where a company that's been collecting
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.520]   data got hacked and the data leaked out.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.640]   These are people selling it.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:28.920]   This is a system for collecting the data, aggregating the data, and then selling it on.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:33.920]   Google is the biggest player.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.480]   That's not news anymore.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:42.240]   Although this, I think this ICL report is kind of eye-opening.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.480]   I think that's probably the...
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:48.360]   Yeah, that's really bad.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:54.080]   Let me say the number again, an average American has their online activity and location exposed
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:59:02.360]   747 times every day by the RTB industry, 747 times a day.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:07.040]   A lot of that information is coming from your phone and from Google.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.000]   They don't mention Apple's involvement in this.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.320]   I'm going to hope Apple's not involved.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:16.760]   Maybe Apple didn't want to come in or to get out of way to lock out.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.200]   You don't have to sell this data on.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:22.600]   Apple and Facebook use these days out of Netflix.
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.600]   Go ahead, Shoshana.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.600]   Oh, sorry.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.840]   Whenever I get anyone's data, I just sell it.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.080]   Yeah, who wants it?
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.520]   I don't eat it.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.480]   I don't eat it.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:35.120]   Anyway, so that's not the typical kind of data breach and you're right.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.040]   It's been going on probably forever.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:42.720]   But the magnitude of it is kind of staggering.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.280]   I really do think the third-party doctrine thing is something that's not talked about
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:47.280]   enough in policy.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:51.800]   It's kind of crazy to me that there's a moral panic around 230, a wall-with-third party
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.800]   doctrine.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:56.520]   They're saying, "Oh, if someone else also owns your data, you have no interest in it,"
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:58.720]   which is just nuts to me.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.560]   I actually got interested in it through the Gorsuch Concurrence and Carpenter.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.360]   I thought that was really, really interesting.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.800]   I mean, I think all the opinions in it were interesting, but it's something that we should
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:14.160]   be thinking about more than why did Twitter ban or not ban this one dude.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:21.080]   So I'm going to explain to me like a fifth grader explain this and correct me if I'm
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.080]   wrong.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.800]   The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution has a prohibition against unreasonable search and
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.800]   seizure.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.280]   You have to have in general probable cause and a search warrant.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.480]   That's of course slowly been whittled away.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.840]   But after several Supreme Court decisions, this third-party doctrine has arisen that
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:45.080]   if you already are giving information to third parties like your phone company or your bank
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:53.560]   or your ISP, then you have no reasonable expectation of privacy for that information.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.920]   Is that essentially what you're talking about here?
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.920]   Show them away.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.920]   Yeah, that's basically it.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.560]   I'm not as deep in it as others are, and it's definitely not my deepest issue, but it
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.360]   is something that's kind of up there for me that we need to shore up whether through
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.880]   the courts or through the legislature or both because it doesn't make sense and precedent.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:16.120]   Like what used to happen in early America, that was not the understanding.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.720]   But government like sets power.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.960]   So it'll try to like get our information and get around warrants as much as it can.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.640]   So let me try to understand what you said as a second grader.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:31.040]   You basically saying because I have a phone, I have no expectation of privacy just because
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.040]   I own a phone.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.360]   And the data you already share with other parties like your location data with Google,
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.480]   the government has a right to that.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.120]   You've basically given up your right to privacy in that regard.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.000]   It's not protected by the Fourth Amendment.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.400]   And in fact, get ready for this Bitcoin advocates.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.600]   In 2020, the Fifth Circuit, our favorite Circuit out of Texas, found that transaction
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:57.280]   data with virtual currency exchanges like Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, are like bank records.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.920]   So they're not protected either.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.560]   They are not protected by the Fourth Amendment.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.080]   So all the people who say, "Oh yeah, Bitcoin is private.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.080]   It's secure."
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.600]   Not according to the Fifth Circuit.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:12.440]   Yeah, that's a terrifying thought.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:18.840]   So that's, I guess, the whole idea of these auctions, these data auctions is, well, it's
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840]   worse.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.280]   The government doesn't have to collect the information.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.440]   You're voluntarily giving it up.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:30.160]   They just have to ask for it or buy it if they want on the exchange.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.320]   That's pretty scary.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.320]   Do you know Shoshana?
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.520]   I understand this isn't necessarily your exact area.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.880]   But do you know of government agencies that are buying this information?
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.400]   Yeah, I know what's been happening.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.680]   I genuinely don't remember offhand which agencies, but it's been something that's become like
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.680]   common practice, which, you know, logistically makes sense if it's a way they can get around
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.280]   needing a warrant and like due process.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.560]   Of course, they're going to do it if they can.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.120]   The law enforcement has had that problem forever.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.920]   It's kind of wild though that there's not as much interest in that.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:08.400]   That it's really, you know, Ron Wyden's really leading here, but that like not a lot of other
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.640]   elected officials are like, "This seems like a violation of rights.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.240]   We might want to like shore up."
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.600]   So yeah, it's a problem that's actively happening and it's just nuts to me that it's getting
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600]   so little coverage.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:26.540]   Well, now that we know how much of our information is, our data smog is coming off of us all
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.540]   the time.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:31.720]   Maybe we should pay a little bit more attention to who's using that information.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.920]   And as I said, you know, you can argue with me that, "Well, it's advertisers.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.080]   That's harmless."
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.560]   But I think we all agree if it's government, it's not harmless.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.480]   It's not harmless.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.760]   That's terrible.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:50.480]   Did you hear Google hired an former Apple?
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.760]   Yeah, that was a good story.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:59.380]   One of Apple's probably their best known AI guy left Apple because he didn't want to
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:00.380]   go back to work.
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:01.380]   Did he want to go back to work?
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:06.140]   In that nice office we built you?
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:12.940]   He tweeted, among other reasons, that he didn't like Apple's back to work policy, which was,
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.940]   by the way, May 23rd.
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.100]   I think everybody is supposed to go back to work.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.100]   I believe they rescind it.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.100]   I think they changed it.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.260]   But Ian Goodfellow.
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:23.000]   Because COVID is not over.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   Yes.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   No, they're right.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   That's right.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.040]   Apple's making you wear masks inside the campus.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:33.720]   Ian Goodfellow, Apple's director of machine learning, tweeted, "I'm out of here.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.360]   I don't like this policy," among other things.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.420]   He came to Apple from Google in 2019.
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:42.440]   He's now back at Google.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.960]   I think this is pretty common in Silicon Valley.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.960]   There's a kind of revolving floor.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.600]   I'm going to say that's what developers tend to do, right?
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.460]   Apparently, at Apple, one of their leading lights in machine learning.
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:58.340]   Well, I'm trying to think if this should be a change log.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:02.620]   I was going to, well...
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:08.260]   The Google allowing you to have your free no-cost legacy G Suite with custom Gmail domain.
[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.820]   You go and explain it first, then I'll complain.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:11.820]   Yes.
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:12.820]   You were on it.
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:13.820]   So you actually were better.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:14.820]   No, I'll tell you no.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:16.660]   I'm always in exception.
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:18.580]   I'm always in the end exception.
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.580]   You can explain it first.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.580]   I think last month...
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.580]   I think last month, popcorn, dang.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:29.060]   So Google had announced that people, at one point you could sign up, have email at your
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:40.660]   domain name, Leo@loport.com or whatever, but have Gmail do it for free, for one address.
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:45.940]   Then they changed that policy a couple of months ago and said, "No, no.
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.620]   We're not going to allow you to do that anymore.
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:54.860]   Now they've announced after Jeff complained, there is going to be a free legacy edition
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:59.340]   of G Suite for personal use.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:00.340]   Jeff, you don't have to be personal.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:01.340]   No, you also have to be personal.
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:02.340]   You don't.
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:03.340]   That's the problem.
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:04.340]   That's why I fail.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.340]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:08.260]   If you don't want to pay for workspace and you don't want to export your data, you can
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:12.420]   continue for free.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.820]   So that's the problem is, right?
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:15.820]   Good news for you.
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.820]   No, it's not.
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:20.260]   Time ago, I ended up saying, "Well, pay because of one more storage or something."
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.260]   I don't know what it was.
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:25.940]   And two of my former colleagues from the company I left 15 years ago, old friends of mine,
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:29.820]   I haven't talked to them about a lot in like years, they have email there and my son has
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.820]   email there.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.260]   So there's four of us on it.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:37.660]   And so I keep on getting these messages from Google saying, "If you don't upgrade and update
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:42.380]   by this, at this price, then it's just going to happen to you like some painful process
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:45.660]   is going to happen without anesthesia."
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:50.420]   And I go to the site to try to figure it out and it's always confusing as hell because
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.380]   I'm just a little old me.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.940]   I don't think I can downgrade to personal.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.300]   So I don't know what the hell's going on.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.700]   And for you, the main thing is keeping your email.
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:00.700]   My domain.
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:01.700]   Your domain.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:02.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:03.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:07.180]   I don't blame you.
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:08.700]   So whatever it is, I'll pay it.
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.660]   You know, okay, Google, you got me.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.660]   Yeah.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.660]   It's not too expensive.
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.660]   It's confusing.
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.660]   No, it's confusing as hell.
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:16.660]   Why change it?
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:20.540]   Are you using it for commercial purposes, Jeff?
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:23.740]   Oh, God, if I wish.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:28.940]   So as long as it's non-commercial personal use, I think it should be free.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:35.140]   But then there's other limits to my domain registration with the registrar.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.300]   No, you still have to pay for that, right?
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.300]   Jeff, you still pay for your...
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:39.300]   Yeah, but that's not much.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.300]   By the way, it's also...
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.300]   It's 10 bucks a year or so.
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.300]   It's got...
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.300]   Ummm...
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.300]   Wall Street Journal.
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.220]   I like the Wall Street Journal.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:53.380]   I always have to take these with a grain of salt, especially in the opinion section.
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:55.820]   Don't try to regulate Google ads.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:56.820]   Todd Henderson...
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:58.460]   I think Shoshana will like this one.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:04.260]   Senator Mike Lee has some legislation that would forbid Google and other tech giants
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:10.060]   to build and operate digital advertising exchanges from owning the tools that help buyers and
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:11.740]   sellers of online advertising.
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:19.940]   This has been a long time criticism of Google that it's both the house and the dealer and
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:21.540]   runs the whole thing.
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:24.660]   Anyway, the Wall Street Journal doesn't like it because...
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.340]   Well, this columnist, this professor.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.340]   Yes.
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.300]   Not only is this bad policy, but it's based on the faulty premise.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.060]   But even he explains it.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:35.220]   That advertising markets are anonymous and analogous to security markets.
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.460]   So do you agree with Mike Lee's legislation, Jeff?
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.460]   He says...
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:40.460]   No, I don't.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.460]   Well, I don't know.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.460]   Honest answers, I don't know.
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:47.940]   However, do I say that?
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:53.700]   This guy makes a good point, which is that this structure, because it could operate so
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:59.340]   efficiently, opened up in a shrinking ad market, it opened up new opportunities.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:05.340]   If you go back to a world where they can't talk to each other so fluidly, he says, "You're
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:08.540]   going to lose ad opportunities and media is going to lose again."
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.620]   And I don't know.
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:11.620]   But it's the Wall Street Journal, so I don't know.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:12.620]   Well, that's what I always...
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.900]   I am at every time I see opinion in Wall Street Journal.
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.900]   I have to go.
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:16.900]   I don't, same here, same here as mine.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:17.900]   Am I...
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:18.900]   Am I again?
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:20.860]   I put it in there because this one made me think and say, "Oh."
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:24.060]   Professor Harnesson does say if Google offers a bad deal, advertisers and publishers have
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.140]   plenty of full service ad companies to choose from.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:29.180]   Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Verizon.
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.820]   It's advertising is not...
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:39.100]   You don't go out to the golf course with your buddy Joe and sell them six months of ads
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.300]   in the sports section, right?
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:41.860]   All that is so far gone.
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:42.860]   It's all...
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:43.860]   It's all done automatically.
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:44.860]   It's all done automatically.
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:45.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:47.620]   In a trading...
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:50.660]   In a make believe trading form.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:56.100]   Art action houses, he says, "Art auction houses offer tools for buyers and sellers
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.500]   and sometimes even bid in the auctions they host."
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:02.340]   Well, I don't know if that's such a good thing.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:05.820]   That's one of the complaints people have had about these NFTs is that a lot of buyers
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:10.180]   of NFTs are pumping the price up artificially by selling it to themselves and then buying
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:13.260]   it and then selling it and buying it.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.580]   I'm not against regulating it.
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:17.060]   I'm not against by any means investigating it.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:22.060]   I just don't think we know fully yet how this marketplace works because it's so big and
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:23.060]   so complex.
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.140]   Look at that prior story about the leak.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:27.580]   Look at the volume you're talking about there.
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.780]   You can't go back.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:29.780]   It's always the...
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:34.260]   The focus on delivering value to end users was the central insight of the Chicago School
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:39.940]   of antitrust to which conservatives like Senator Lee used to look for economic insight in making
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:44.780]   an in-apt analogy to the security market Senator Lee's bill would take us back to a less efficient
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:45.780]   time.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:52.500]   I just feel stupid because it seems like a good idea to me, but I don't want to be inefficient
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.500]   for God's sake.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.340]   Shoshana, have you covered this at all?
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:57.500]   A little bit.
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:01.700]   I mean, a lot of the bills I think aren't really necessary.
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:06.980]   If Google is doing fraud, that's frauds already a thing you can't do.
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.380]   I don't think you need regulations on top of it.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:14.140]   It's possible that there's something I'm missing, but a lot of like, Lee's and others arguments
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:18.100]   are that there's like no place to place your ad except for Google and Facebook.
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:22.420]   So they're like a duopoly and I'm like, "No, you can put your ad somewhere else if you
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:23.420]   choose.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.220]   You can talk it out with someone, figure out other methods."
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.540]   But a lot of their argument is that the market's so tight that if they don't like this,
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:30.940]   they can't go elsewhere.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:35.820]   So I think it's still part of that big tech moral panic.
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.820]   I'm definitely not me jerk against regulations if they make sense, but I think this one is
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:45.820]   just a little too moral panicky and I tend to think that look into it sure, but right
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:52.180]   now I don't think there's a strong case that Google's doing anything that needs new legislation.
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:56.940]   People often point to stuff like where Facebook inflated video views, but that was fraud and
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.740]   the FTC was like, "This is fraud.
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:11:59.740]   You can't do that."
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.380]   I think that's how it's supposed to work.
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:08.180]   There is a mistrust though of regulatory ability to catch companies like Google and stuff like
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:15.140]   this because it's so arcane and so high speed and it's mostly so opaque that it's not clear
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:18.420]   how regulators would know if they were an issue, if they were fraud.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:21.300]   Then I'm not sure new legislation would fix that though.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.300]   That's true.
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:27.300]   I do think that government needs to better understand tech and actually one thing our
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:33.700]   streets advocated for is reinstating the Office of Technology Assessment to the higher experts
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.580]   so that way we can understand stuff better.
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:38.620]   I'm very open to that, just more expertise in government.
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:43.940]   We've also been advocates for more staff pay because while we want to shrink government,
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:49.860]   having a just wildly inefficient government with no institutional knowledge is not very
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:50.860]   efficient.
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:55.100]   I think there's a lot that has to happen before you can get to that point.
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:13:00.300]   Part of it too is that I don't trust regulators who don't understand what they're regulating
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:05.620]   and that in itself can cause regulatory capture problems.
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:08.580]   It's something I see quite often where it's like, "Oh, I don't understand it.
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:11.540]   I'll defer to the expert who runs this business."
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.540]   Then, "Oh, wait.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:13.540]   They're the only business that exists.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:14.540]   That's weird.
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:15.540]   How did that happen?"
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.540]   Exactly.
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:18.020]   No, I completely agree with you.
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.700]   Newt Gingrich dissolved the Office of Technology Assessment.
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:28.140]   That was a massive mistake that left members of Congress without any objective information
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.140]   about how this stuff works.
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.140]   I don't know.
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:36.340]   It's worked out pretty well with all the illiterate section 230 bills that have come
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:37.340]   out.
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.340]   I think it's going pretty well.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:45.620]   Honestly, this has come up with when people talk about Senator Feinstein, who's clearly
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:50.420]   kind of towards the end of her abilities.
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.940]   But as the staff does most of the work, right?
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:58.100]   It really does come down to how smart your staff is, how good your staff is.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:02.940]   You said, "Shoshana, maybe there should be more staff."
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:06.180]   Staff also should be given tools like USDA.
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.940]   Yeah, better pay, more resources.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.940]   There's all kinds of things that can help.
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:14.740]   I've known so many incredible staff paid like nothing.
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:21.420]   I know someone who ended up going back to Congress, but when they were working, they'd
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.380]   read all of my work before we met.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.180]   And we became friends because of it.
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:31.180]   But they were paid like $30,000 doing a wild level of work and really, really trying.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:34.220]   So of course, they're going to leave to go to the private sector.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:38.020]   Other friends who weren't making much want to start a family.
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:40.660]   I mean, for rent in DC is really high too.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.780]   It's a really, really expensive city.
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:48.140]   And when you're making it so either only rich people's kids can afford to work in Congress.
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:50.740]   Or if you're not, you have to leave if you want to move up.
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.500]   That's just not a healthy environment.
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:56.620]   We should be retaining that institutional knowledge, rewarding good staff.
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:15:00.860]   But to that end though, I think after all my work with government, one big thing that
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:06.260]   I've really seen is you can really judge an elected official by their staff.
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:12.380]   People who have really good, strong, knowledgeable teams tend to produce better legislation and
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:13.380]   better work.
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:16.260]   It's something that's really, really important.
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:18.100]   That is a good government, right?
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:22.380]   I mean, you can't, I think people say, "Oh, well, the senators should be doing all the
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:23.380]   work."
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:29.100]   But I think that good government means you, first of all, it's a big job and no one person
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.380]   can do it.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:34.060]   And good government means that they're given the resources they need to get the information
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:36.780]   they need so they can make intelligent decisions.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.980]   Yeah, you have to know what you don't know.
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:43.660]   These elected officials who come from the military know those issues really well.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.860]   There's others who come from business, like holdstone and you don't know that really
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:47.860]   well.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:49.300]   But there's all different sides to it.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:52.820]   And it's always really frustrating when a politician just wants to need your, cannot
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:53.820]   listen to their staff.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:59.220]   But the ones who have that really strong staff, that's the best kind of stuff.
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.900]   Unfortunately, there could be a little more of it in certain cases.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:04.300]   But there also is a lot of really great staff.
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:08.660]   They just can't always afford to live in DC and work in Congress.
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:09.660]   They lose money doing it.
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:13.140]   Of course, it's really a sacrifice.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:19.580]   So thank you to all the, I know we have quite a few members of Congress staff members who
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:20.820]   listened to our shows.
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:23.020]   So trying to keep up with what's going on.
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:24.340]   We thank you for the job you're doing.
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.340]   Good to do.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:27.860]   It's a great civil service.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:32.700]   Speaking of which, by the way, we're working to get Matt cuts to come back, former director
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:34.700]   of the US Digital Services.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:35.700]   He's a busy guy.
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.700]   He's enjoying life on the street.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:40.100]   Is he in Canada or is he in Washington?
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.100]   I think he's in Canada.
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.060]   I'm not sure.
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:48.260]   But I think Jason said soon, soon, I think was the word.
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:52.180]   So looking forward to getting Matt, speaking of great civil servants, getting Matt back.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.180]   Yeah.
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.660]   Our show today brought to you by Noreva.
[01:16:55.660 --> 01:17:00.780]   Oh, people coming back to work, leaving, coming back, leaving.
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:04.900]   There's one thing almost you almost certainly can be sure of in that conference room, that
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:10.460]   meeting room, that huddles room, you probably have people in person.
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:13.820]   You probably have people on the phone remote.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:18.020]   You got a mix and you got to make sure everybody can hear everybody.
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:20.460]   Everybody's comfortable with the situation.
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:25.140]   Sometimes that means, oh, I'm going to go spend thousands and thousands of dollars on
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:28.460]   a traditional system, a traditional conference system.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.460]   What am I saying?
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:31.660]   Thousands, tens of thousands of dollars.
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:33.380]   You got to have design software.
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:34.380]   You've got to have experts.
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:35.940]   You've got to have Matt that come in.
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:38.260]   They measure the room.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:44.180]   You have a dizzying array of DSPs and speakers and microphones.
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:49.780]   And it's just, it's just crazy outside technicians who have to come calibrate the thing frequently.
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:50.780]   It's expensive.
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:51.780]   It's invasive.
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:54.140]   It could take your room offline for days.
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:55.580]   It's about time.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:59.700]   We entered the 21st century for those huddle rooms and that's Noreva.
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:06.540]   Noreva has patented the revolutionary microphone mist technology that means all you have to
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:12.340]   do for great audio in your conference room is install one or two integrated microphone
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:13.340]   and speaker bars.
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:16.580]   They look just like a sound bar you'd have in your home.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:20.340]   They fill the room with thousands of virtual microphones.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:22.480]   There are no dead zones.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.980]   Everyone can be heard everywhere in the room clearly, crisply, no matter where they're
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:31.340]   facing, no matter how their social distancing, meeting and class participants can just talk
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.980]   and move naturally in the space.
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:37.300]   And remote participants don't feel left out.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.700]   They don't feel second class.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:40.180]   They can hear what's going on.
[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.780]   They're part of the meeting.
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:48.220]   And with Noreva, thanks to continuous auto calibration, your rooms are always instantly
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:52.780]   ready with optimized audio, no technician required.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:55.660]   Your IT department will love it because they get an Noreva console.
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:59.660]   They get the power to monitor, manage, adjust the system from anywhere.
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.420]   They don't even have to be on site.
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.540]   And they certainly don't have to go from room to room.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.460]   The simple installation, it's so easy.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:07.100]   It's a 30 minute DIY job.
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.900]   If you can install a sound bar, you can install Noreva.
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:13.660]   So that's going to save on time and cost compared to traditional systems.
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:14.660]   It looks great.
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.660]   It sounds great.
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:18.900]   And everybody can hear what's going on.
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:21.020]   I don't know why you would choose anything else.
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.740]   Why would you want to go with that costly, complicated, traditional system?
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:30.140]   Make the leap to the modern, simple, economical Noreva.
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.500]   N-U-R-E-V-A.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:36.340]   You can learn more at Noreva.com.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:37.540]   It's just incredible.
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:38.780]   You just got to try this.
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:40.140]   N-U-R-E-V-A, Noreva.com.
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:46.060]   Well, thank you so much for supporting our show this week in Google.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.300]   Thank you, Noreva.
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:54.500]   Simple messages, users in India drowning in ads.
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:59.580]   This is maybe the unintended consequence of RCS, the rich communication system.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:03.340]   Google's been pushing on us.
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:08.220]   Users are being sent multiple ads a day, even with spam protection on.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.540]   Blocking and reporting the offended accounts doesn't seem to prevent ads from other companies
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.420]   appearing.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:18.100]   Personal loans, gambling companies, life insurance.
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:24.860]   They're abusing, it seems, according to 9-5 Google, an RCS feature that's designed to
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:30.980]   let businesses contact their customers with rich, interactive media.
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:34.580]   Sending customers QR code tickets, letting them make online orders.
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:38.780]   Instead, some accounts Google identifies as verified businesses are sending users in
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:41.620]   India a barrage of ads.
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:44.020]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:46.140]   Did you see this tweet?
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:49.820]   If you're wondering how bad the ads in Google Messages can get, I got all these in the last
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:52.020]   seven hours.
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:54.260]   Rummy Circle make a blockbuster entry.
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:58.580]   Bajaj Finance, no cost to my flip card enough for you, Canvas.
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:01.180]   Can you imagine?
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:02.180]   Can you imagine?
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:03.180]   Is that cost you bought it?
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:04.180]   This is on text, getting?
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:05.980]   Well, that's a good question.
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:06.980]   Or messages.
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:07.980]   Google Messages.
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:08.980]   This is RCS.
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:11.420]   Well, it might in India, it might.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:12.500]   That's a good question.
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.740]   What can Google do about this?
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:22.380]   I wonder if it's Google's issue or if it's the phone company's issues.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:25.300]   That's a really good question.
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:31.020]   Indian based Ishaan Agarwal, whose recent tweets have drawn attention to the issue, tells the
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:37.180]   verge that the problems have been growing worse over the course of 2022.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:42.580]   Android Police says the problem has been around for a year, mostly complaints coming mostly
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:45.420]   from users in India.
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:54.380]   The only way to stop receiving ads entirely is to disable RCS support.
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:57.740]   Google did not respond to the Verge's request for comment.
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:58.740]   Oh, man.
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:21:59.740]   Wow.
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:02.660]   Thank you, John Porter, from the Verge.
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:08.220]   We're actually on the, I don't know if anybody, have you been, anybody getting an upswell in
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:09.940]   robo calls and spam calls?
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:10.940]   Yeah.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.340]   So, yeah, oh my gosh.
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:15.260]   My phone rings and I don't even think about it anymore.
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:16.260]   It's just not stop, right?
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:19.460]   It used to be, you know, I'm like, okay, well, today is Thursday.
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.260]   I'm probably going to hear from my mother.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.100]   So listen out for the phone.
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.100]   You know that.
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:25.460]   A mob your spam.
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:26.460]   Right.
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:28.700]   But now it's just ringing all the time.
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:30.420]   I've just, I don't even think.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:37.300]   So I can tell you why I think the FCC, we've talked about this before, has an authentication
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:41.740]   caller ID authentication service called Stir and Shake in, which they're going to require.
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:46.060]   Right now T-Mobile Verizon, AT&T all use it.
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.740]   And in theory, could reject calls that aren't authenticated.
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:53.420]   And of course, no spammer wants their call to be authenticated because they want to hide
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:55.660]   who they are.
[01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:57.780]   But there is a loophole.
[01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:00.780]   The FCC has been putting this off.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:07.420]   The Commission granted a small voice service providers with 100 or fewer subscriber lines
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:13.860]   and extension until June 30th, 2023.
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:17.780]   And I guess the reason, but of course, that's the ones the spammers are using.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:21.180]   They're not, they're, they're using some VoIP service.
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:23.780]   Somebody got mad at me because I used to say treated that in Tobago.
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:26.220]   So I'll find a different place out of a ruba.
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:27.220]   Okay.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:28.220]   Some out of East Virginia.
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:29.220]   East Virginia.
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:30.220]   Perfect.
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.980]   Don't you dare play my constituents.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:34.420]   That's not the wrong.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:39.260]   So the FCC did move that timeline up a little bit.
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:46.060]   So now if you do not, if you're a hundred thousand subscribers or fewer and you don't
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:52.420]   have actual buildings, facilities, you got to knock it off June 30th.
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:59.060]   So it's my theory that these guys say we got, oh my God, we got six weeks left.
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:00.740]   Release the hell.
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:02.420]   Blen some.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:05.340]   So let's see, but June 30th, it should get better.
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:10.620]   And then June 30th, the following year, facilities based phone companies, small phone
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:15.020]   companies, those with buildings, like the actual Aruba phone company or the actual East
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:19.500]   Virginia phone company, they will, they will have to stop as well.
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.980]   And of course, then it's going to be up to AT, T, Verizon spread over your T mobile,
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:28.380]   whoever your carriers to reject unauthenticated calls, just say no, or maybe give you a switch
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:32.340]   that says, Hey, look, if it's not sure or shaken authenticated, well given, I don't
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:34.620]   want to hear it just as inconvenient.
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:38.260]   That means my phone is still going to ring and I have to sit and, no, you need a permanent,
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:40.780]   you need a switch that says, just don't let anything unauthenticated.
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:42.900]   Yeah, because your mom's authenticated.
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:43.900]   Right.
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:49.860]   Anything legit should be authenticated.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:54.020]   So legit question here, because I don't do telecom policy as much.
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:59.380]   I know a little bit, not very much, but like, are there small legitimate services and people
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:01.780]   who could be affected by this negatively?
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:07.980]   Well, so I think spammers use a VoIP, you know, online only services.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:08.980]   They're very cheap.
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:12.300]   You can send a million calls for a couple of bucks.
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:17.260]   I think those people probably really need to be stopped.
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:20.620]   But if you're the small East Virginia phone company.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.380]   What about the press Democrat trying to do a big campaign?
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.500]   Well, no, it's the phone company that has to implement it.
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:31.180]   And the press Democrat needs to go through a legitimate phone company that's using Stern
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.180]   and shaken.
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:33.180]   Okay.
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.620]   I don't think that that's a hardship.
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:37.060]   I mean, I don't think it's expensive to implement.
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:40.300]   I'm sure it's, you know, it's a little complicated.
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:43.340]   But mostly, I think these small phone companies are not implementing it because they make
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:47.700]   a lot of money selling, you know, spam services to companies.
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:49.700]   We've seen that.
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:50.700]   Yeah, I was good.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:54.660]   I was just curious about the regulatory compliance costs because it doesn't sound like it's that
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:56.300]   bad here.
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.380]   I mean, I'd love to stop receiving spam calls.
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:02.500]   I'm just always worried about competition, you know.
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.500]   You know what?
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:07.620]   You're going to have to get your friends at RSI to get to work on this because that's
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:08.620]   a good question.
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:16.780]   I don't know why you wouldn't want to do this, but maybe there is a large cost.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:25.060]   It's the stir, which is secured telephony identity revisited, came from the IETF.
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:28.620]   It's basically digitally certificate based.
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:34.340]   So the SIP, the session initiation protocol would have a certificate which would identify
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:37.220]   you.
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:41.900]   The first public connection to the system, the VoIP service provider, would examine the
[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:45.860]   caller ID, compares it to a known list of IDs they provided that customer.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:48.100]   In other words, it says, are you authentic?
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:49.100]   Are you genuine?
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:53.620]   And then they attach an encrypted certificate to the SIP header with a service provider
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:55.260]   that is in the antitrust value.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:27:01.860]   That seems like a simple thing, not so complicated to do.
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:05.940]   Shaken, which is signature based handling of asserted information using tokens.
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:10.140]   I hate these retronims.
[01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:15.500]   It's for public switch telephone networks to tell them how to deal with calls that have
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:19.900]   incorrect or missing stir information.
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:24.820]   So what do you do if it's not authentic, in other words?
[01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:26.180]   And this has been going on.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:31.500]   The FCC started talking about this three or four years ago because of the epidemic of
[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:34.620]   robocalls and spam calls.
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:36.660]   What caused the...
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:39.940]   Because it was working for a while.
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:40.940]   What was making?
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:47.700]   When you did the do not call list, and I joined that list some years ago, and for a while,
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:50.500]   my phone was a phone.
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.340]   What happened?
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:56.060]   Is it because do not call sold something potentially?
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:57.060]   No, that's a...
[01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.060]   No, I don't think so.
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.060]   I think...
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:05.900]   I don't know, but I'm going to guess that because of voice over internet, it's dramatic...
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:07.740]   It's the same as the spam is through the roof.
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:09.340]   It's dramatically cheaper to do this.
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:11.620]   You can't tell who's who.
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:15.820]   And do not call works in the US.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:22.100]   Do not call all the prohibitions against spam and robocalls that we have in the US work.
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:26.900]   But most of these people are outside the US using small, white-based phone companies
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:30.660]   outside the US, outside jurisdiction, and can't be stopped.
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:36.700]   There have been a number of notorious spammers arrested and prosecuted, and I think they're
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:42.420]   in jail now, but it didn't make a dent in it because most of the people are overseas,
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:44.420]   I believe.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:46.420]   26...
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:47.420]   All the wall.
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:48.420]   26...
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:49.420]   Yeah, right.
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:50.420]   Against robocalls.
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:56.060]   26 billion calls in 2019 between January and October.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:03.140]   46 billion is the estimate in 2020, so it's almost doubled in a year.
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:09.260]   So you're right to say something's going on.
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:14.380]   And of course, the latest thing is you pose as a local exchange, same area code, same
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:17.700]   same three-digit exchange.
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:20.180]   And now the latest, latest one comes from your number.
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:22.220]   Is your number calling you?
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:23.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:24.220]   All the time.
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:28.220]   That's completely illegal.
[01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:31.980]   And neighbor spoofing, which is using the same area code or the same area code in exchange,
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:32.980]   is completely illegal.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:37.460]   It doesn't stop these people because they're not in the US here.
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:39.660]   But Stern-Shakin would because the Carls wouldn't even go through.
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:41.460]   They'd say, "Well, what's your authentication?
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:42.460]   What's your certificate?"
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:43.460]   "Well, I'm not telling you that.
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:44.940]   Well, then you're not going through."
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:47.820]   But that is going to rely on the phone companies doing it.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:54.100]   And I suspect there's money in it that they may be getting kickbacks.
[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:56.100]   Who knows?
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:00.940]   Yeah, I bribed them from my Senate seat.
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:01.940]   Yeah.
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:02.940]   It's you.
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:03.940]   I thought so.
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:05.980]   Canada has already implemented this, by the way.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:12.300]   So ask your Canadian friends how much robocalls they get.
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:19.700]   This reminds me of Mark Rober on YouTube.
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:20.860]   He does take a litter bomb.
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:21.860]   Okay.
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:22.860]   What do you think of this?
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.180]   So I have some qualms about this.
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:30.780]   So Mark Rober, famous NASA scientist, has been doing this for to porch pirates for some
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:32.180]   years, right?
[01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:37.540]   He makes these boxes that look like valuable Amazon packages.
[01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:42.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:47.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:51.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:54.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:57.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:00.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:03.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:06.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:09.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:12.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:15.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:19.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:23.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:27.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:30.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:33.540]   And it's like a lot of people who have been doing this.
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:36.540]   And I feel like this is vigilanteism.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:37.540]   Yeah.
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:40.540]   The city needs a hero.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:43.540]   Gosh, she's good.
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:46.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:47.540]   Not the hero we want.
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:49.540]   The hero we have.
[01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:55.540]   So I'm genuinely jealous of his success because with the romance scammers,
[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:58.540]   usually what I'll do is when he asks for my number,
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:01.540]   I'll send him to the FTC romance scam line.
[01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:04.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:07.540]   My knowledge, I've asked the FTC to like, I mean,
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:11.540]   I don't know if they would, but like, like, let me know if they were able to catch anyone from that.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:12.540]   And I tried.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:13.540]   You're right.
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.540]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:16.540]   Like, I should get like whatever he was going to steal from me.
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:20.540]   Like, I should earn from like the FTC, I feel like.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:24.540]   But I was upset because I don't think I've ever successfully caught them.
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:25.540]   I've tried.
[01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.540]   I've been like, hey, call the FTC.
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:29.540]   Like, this has to do something.
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:31.540]   I just don't think it's enough, unfortunately.
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:33.540]   So I'm very jealous of his success.
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:40.540]   Well, it wasn't successful with the law enforcement in these places until he got a lot of attention.
[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:45.540]   And then finally, the law enforcement did start to come in and roll these things up.
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:46.540]   But they'll be right back.
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:47.540]   Look, they're finally right.
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:49.540]   They'll bribe the law enforcement.
[01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:51.540]   They'll be right back doing it again in a month.
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:52.540]   I don't know.
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:54.540]   I just feel like it's vigilanteism.
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:55.540]   I guess if you, I don't know.
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:33:03.820]   Okay, to do something horrible to another person, if they're just because they're doing something
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:08.540]   horrible to other people and do these guys know what they were doing even?
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:09.540]   That's the other question.
[01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:11.540]   This is some schmuck who needs a job.
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:12.540]   Yeah.
[01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:15.540]   And it's not guaranteed with some schmuck who needs a job.
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:20.860]   Well, the way the video played out was the people that are hired, they're going to work
[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:24.940]   for a said company that does whatever customer service was somewhere else.
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:26.380]   That's what they say legally.
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.940]   During the day they do customer service.
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:28.940]   Right.
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.260]   That's what they say paper legally.
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:36.460]   But there's another floor upstairs, if you will, that's sort of locked off and everything.
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.740]   But that's where the real money is being made.
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:42.340]   So the legal stuff is just the front to cover up the...
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:43.340]   Yeah.
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.340]   I feel bad.
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:50.780]   Well, I think the morality of the vigilantism, I think it boils down to, was it funny?
[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:52.660]   And I think this is for now.
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.420]   If it's funny, it's okay.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:34:00.860]   See, you guys look at this screen, the call centers, they're legit call centers.
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:02.580]   Yeah, no, I understand.
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:03.580]   I don't know.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:05.980]   It's something about this bugs me.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:13.180]   But all right, is it a problem for him delivering glitter packages or putting glitter packages
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.180]   on the front porch?
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:15.780]   You have a problem with that?
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:16.780]   No.
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:18.580]   For some reason it doesn't bother me.
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:20.980]   Because he's a suburban guy once you get his package.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:22.860]   No, we don't have any porch pirates.
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:23.860]   But...
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.500]   I mean, those guys, yeah.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.500]   Because I didn't worry about porch pirates.
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:29.500]   Are you right?
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:34.260]   I didn't bother them for a long time until I started noticing it was picking up in the
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:35.260]   news.
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:36.260]   It's like, well, crap.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:41.220]   So I had to start looking out and put cameras up at our place just to make sure.
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:45.580]   And yes, we have had people wandering into the yard before.
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:46.580]   Yeah.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.580]   Like what the hell are you doing?
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.580]   I think a good point.
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:50.420]   It doesn't bother me that it's a porch pirates.
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:53.180]   I feel bad for these poor guys in India.
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:56.220]   We're probably making 500 rupees a day.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:35:00.220]   What about a four-day disinformation person in Belarus?
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:01.220]   Pardon me.
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.220]   Okay.
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:06.780]   If it were a disinformation farm in Belarus, you can't remember that.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:07.780]   I don't know.
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:08.780]   And you know what?
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:13.380]   I think what Shoshana does to romance scammers is perfectly fine.
[01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:16.940]   I don't know.
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:17.940]   It's just me.
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:18.940]   It's just me.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:19.940]   Breaking news.
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:21.660]   Google declares bankruptcy.
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:23.660]   Oh, come on.
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:24.660]   In Russia.
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:25.660]   Oh, okay.
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:26.980]   Well, no, that's a big deal.
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:27.980]   I had 87.
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:28.980]   Okay.
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:29.980]   All right.
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:30.980]   Bankruptcy in Russia.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:34.380]   What did I don't even understand what that means?
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:35.820]   Their bank accounts got seized.
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:36.820]   Oh.
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:39.380]   And so I think it's also a way to say we don't owe anybody.
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:40.620]   We got no room.
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:42.620]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:46.780]   So they file an attention to clear bankruptcy after the seizure of its bank account made
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:49.180]   it untenable to meet financial obligations.
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:51.020]   Well, yeah.
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:56.580]   Here's some McDonald's coupons for you.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:57.580]   Yeah, really.
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:59.820]   That's big of scammers.
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:04.900]   Apparently, there are more than a few McDonald's opening in Russia now from, you know, copycats.
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:06.060]   I think that's hysterical.
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.660]   It's not a big Mac if it's not under the Golden Arches.
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:11.220]   I just want to say.
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:12.700]   Do they have all day breakfast?
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.460]   Oh, well, that would be different.
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:16.460]   That's a good point.
[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:18.380]   If I can get it in McMuffin at 4 p.m.
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:20.420]   Does the ice cream machine work?
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:21.420]   It does.
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:22.420]   It does.
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:23.420]   It's not a McDonald's.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:25.020]   In Soviet Union.
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.180]   The Florida machine spins.
[01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:28.180]   Yeah.
[01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:37.220]   Uh, Chinese internet sensors try a new trick revealing users locations on your own, on
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:38.900]   your message.
[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:41.100]   Like, okay.
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:46.180]   So we've seen this before, uh, where they, uh, shamed jaywalkers by putting their picture
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:49.620]   up on billboards saying you're jaywalkers.
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:55.700]   Uh, apparently, uh, shaming in China is a very effective tool.
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:56.700]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:37:00.100]   Displaying social media users locations beneath their posts.
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:03.860]   Authorities say the location tags, which are displayed automatically, will help unearth
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:06.380]   overseas disinformation campaigns.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:12.060]   Ah, so they're not going after Chinese citizens, just Americans, let's say Russians trying
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.940]   to publish disinformation in China.
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:15.940]   Mm.
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:21.980]   Isn't the same practice in place for like people to write bad checks or something like that?
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:23.820]   Well, yeah, they do a lot of social shaming.
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:24.820]   We know that.
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:25.820]   Yeah.
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:26.820]   I, this isn't about that though.
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:29.740]   This is saying, look, this doesn't come from inside the country.
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:31.860]   This, this, this is coming from outside.
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:32.860]   Yeah.
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:33.860]   Huh.
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:39.860]   Those who appear to be getting online from abroad, even if they're using a VPN are treated
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:43.820]   as foreign agitators and spies.
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:46.100]   So there's a, maybe a secondary benefit.
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:50.700]   This also prevents the use of VPNs, right?
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:51.700]   That's interesting.
[01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:53.020]   That's it.
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:38:00.020]   That really is maybe it isn't aimed at outside disinformation after all.
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:03.340]   Inside Mark Zuckerberg's billionaire lifestyle.
[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:05.820]   That's a little cheap, but I put it up there.
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:07.660]   Here's $400 T shirts.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:10.780]   You know, it's just another chance to look at his, at his house.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:11.780]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:12.780]   It's just fine.
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:13.780]   Yeah.
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:19.060]   By the way, Mark, you can go to Mark's, we'll go to a Buck Mason and get him for a long time.
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:20.060]   Yeah.
[01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:22.620]   It actually be getting him for a little.
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:23.620]   Good.
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:24.620]   Then a little kuchanelli.
[01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:25.620]   Foreign dollars.
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.020]   Why would a T-shirt be 400 bucks?
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:28.940]   It does look good on him though.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:29.940]   Okay.
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:30.940]   It makes him look good.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.940]   Okay.
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:32.940]   It's fit nicely.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:33.940]   Buck Mason would look better.
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:34.940]   I think a buck Mason do you?
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:36.940]   I think you should send him a song.
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:38.740]   Yeah, you go, Mark.
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:41.500]   He bought 707 acres on Kauai.
[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:42.500]   Yeah, we knew that.
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:43.500]   I love that.
[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:44.500]   And jealous as hell.
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:45.500]   That's nice.
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:46.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:47.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.460]   Here's his, his.
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:50.700]   Now, palatial mansion.
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:53.260]   I don't think that looks like a kind of normal house.
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.580]   It's a five bedroom house.
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:55.580]   It's a nice house.
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:56.580]   It's a big house.
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:58.420]   It's a palatial mansion.
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:01.820]   The thing that's palatial is he also bought all the houses around it.
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:02.820]   Yeah.
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:04.380]   So we wouldn't have any neighbors.
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:06.620]   My former CEO did that.
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:07.620]   Really?
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:08.620]   Mm-hmm.
[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:09.620]   In Lake Norman, Carolina.
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:10.620]   Wow.
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.700]   I could cost a lot less there.
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:13.700]   Yeah, a lot less.
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:18.780]   But he still spent the pretty penny, you know, every couple years, someone was trying to
[01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:19.940]   move or sell their home.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:24.380]   I have fantasies of, you know, he was like, yeah, I'll have a dead end of just buying
[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:27.940]   everybody's house on the dead end, then putting up a giant gate.
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:28.940]   Mm-hmm.
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:30.540]   He lives on the peninsula.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:31.540]   Yeah.
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:32.540]   We invite you all to live with us.
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:36.460]   Also, Anthony tear down the houses or just put friends in them.
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:41.020]   One of them, his mom moved into and the rest of it was all torn down.
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:42.020]   It's just a massive.
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:45.900]   Oh, massive piece of land there on the peninsula.
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:50.180]   And now it's time for Jeff Jarvis's TikTok list.
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:51.180]   Oh, okay.
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:52.980]   Yeah, here we go.
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:53.980]   Here we go.
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:54.980]   Did you?
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:56.180]   I'm thinking you posted these.
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:57.180]   No music.
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:58.180]   No musical.
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.180]   The TikTok none.
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:02.260]   Well, not just a none.
[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:03.260]   It's a trend.
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:04.260]   It's a trend.
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:05.260]   It's a trend.
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:07.540]   Well, anytime two people do something, it's a trend.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:08.980]   And the times is on it.
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:09.980]   It's enough.
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:10.980]   Yeah, the times is on.
[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:14.300]   Oh, so these are all different nuns who are on TikTok.
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:15.300]   Well, that's okay.
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:17.780]   They want to see me in a nun is cool.
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:21.740]   So this nun I started watching her and I actually kind of got it grossed out.
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:24.420]   She's telling me about the lotion she puts up her nose.
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:26.140]   Oh, no, don't, no.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:28.300]   Yeah, but there are nuns or people too.
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:29.300]   It's like a very nice lady.
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:30.460]   Nuns are people too.
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:32.660]   I think this is like Father Robert, right?
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:34.220]   This is what the church.
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:35.820]   And there, by the way, they're not all Catholic nuns.
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:37.580]   There's some, there's a piss-cool nun here.
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:38.580]   This is, this is good.
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:40.940]   Wait, why does she put lotion up her nose?
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:45.340]   Oh, you know, Shoshana, always getting to the, no, you should be.
[01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:46.340]   The need of the man.
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.340]   We should listen.
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:48.340]   Maybe we should watch the nun.
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:50.140]   All right, which one is that one?
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:51.540]   That's the, that's the video right there.
[01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:52.540]   This one.
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:54.540]   This one right here?
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:55.540]   Yeah.
[01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:58.300]   So today we're going to talk about nun pockets.
[01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:02.220]   Anybody who went to Catholic school or hung out with nuns or hangs out with nuns who were
[01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:05.580]   a traditional habit knows that we have special pockets.
[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:07.900]   Okay, I don't want to know very special pockets.
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:10.820]   I think she put lotion in her spit.
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:12.660]   Oh wait, here's the skincare routine.
[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:16.380]   Girl, I'm not going to trust a nun.
[01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:19.220]   It says, girl, drop your skincare routine.
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:23.740]   I'm going to show you a really nice ladies have left comments.
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.660]   I got to say she has a lot younger.
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:26.660]   Nice skin.
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:28.380]   And I just want to say thank you.
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:29.380]   That's really nice.
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:35.740]   If you've been sending me direct messages asking, well, my skincare routine is, which is really
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:36.900]   hilarious to me.
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:41.980]   Because I don't really have one, but maybe I think I know what you're talking about.
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:46.660]   I think I probably have a few less wrinkles than some people my age because I can't go
[01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:47.660]   out in the sun.
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:48.660]   She hasn't been around men.
[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:52.180]   Since the late 1990s, I haven't been able to go out in the sun.
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:54.020]   I get migraines from the sun.
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:55.020]   So I have to walk around.
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:56.020]   Oh, bless.
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:42:02.060]   How many followers does nun sense have 163,000 followers?
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:03.060]   Good for her.
[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:06.420]   She's from New Jersey and Episcopal nun from New Jersey.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.620]   Well, that's tiktok story number one.
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:09.620]   We should do it.
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:11.700]   I've said the Google change log.
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:14.620]   Let's get like the tiktok log roll.
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:18.580]   All right, Mr. Nelson, you need to come up with a new one.
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:20.780]   New bumper spreadsheets are now cool.
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:23.380]   Thanks to tiktok.
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:25.060]   This is from the financial times.
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:30.820]   This is so silly watching these mainstream media outlets trying to be hit by we're going
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:35.140]   to somebody do a think piece on tiktok reach reach.
[01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:39.020]   Tiktok ruins everything a six flags meal hack.
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:40.660]   So tiktok ruins everything is the headline.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:42.060]   Okay, you're going to click on that.
[01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:46.300]   And it turns out that there was a meal hack for the season ticket.
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:49.700]   And when they put it on tiktok, everybody discovered it and did it.
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:52.820]   And six flags said, whoa, we're losing money on this.
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:54.140]   Forget it.
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:56.940]   So the argument is stop spreading this stuff.
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:58.420]   Let the privileged few know it.
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:42:59.420]   Don't put it on tiktok.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:03.020]   I think it's very egalitarian.
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:05.020]   I think that's what's so great about tiktok.
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:10.540]   Tiktok's new ad product gives creators a chance to partner with marketers on branded
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:11.540]   content.
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:17.900]   Tiktok is starting to share more of its ad dollars with creators.
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.820]   Henry tells me.
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:22.620]   Salt hank tells me he's making some money on it.
[01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:26.380]   Yeah, he's getting a few thousand dollars a month or something from tiktok.
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:27.380]   But he sells ads.
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:30.420]   That's his, you know, his main thing.
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:34.060]   Like his like his pop.
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:38.140]   I'm going in my footsteps.
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:42.740]   Tiktok announced it's launching a new ad product called branded mission that will allow
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:50.460]   creators to connect with brands and possibly receive rewards for videos.
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:54.580]   Possibly see, I want to get, I want to get paid for my ads, not possible rewards.
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:58.300]   I want to actually, I want actual rewards.
[01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:02.420]   Tiktok says eligible creators whose videos are selected by the brands will benefit from
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:05.100]   a cash payment and boosted traffic.
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:06.100]   That's better.
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:09.860]   Yeah, but well, that's they're going to get thousands of them saying here, pick, make,
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:10.860]   pick, make, pick me.
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:16.140]   This is a great way to get a bunch of extra ads for no money.
[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:18.940]   So I guess I have to do the change.
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:20.940]   Like let's let's do the change.
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:22.780]   It's so thrilled.
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:27.860]   Shoshana, you see, so the deal here is it's a show about Google.
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:28.860]   We do nothing about Google.
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:32.060]   So this is our obligatory Google obligatory Google.
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:33.060]   segment.
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:39.780]   YouTube now highlights the most replayed parts of videos to let you skip the boring parts.
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:45.500]   So if you if you thought YouTube videos were all there, just too long.
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.980]   Now you can just skip the boring parts.
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:50.780]   Wow.
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:55.660]   So here is, for instance, perfect example of Google, a YouTube video, taking the two hour
[01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:58.780]   Google IO keynote, boiling it down to nine minutes.
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:01.020]   Well, that's just too long.
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:04.780]   So I'm going to I'm going to just see the most replayed parts.
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:05.780]   Interesting.
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:08.980]   Short attention span much.
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:10.940]   All right, that's fine.
[01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:14.780]   Google's new security branding for Android.
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:17.980]   You'll see this now is protected by Android.
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:23.340]   Don't get protected by Android.
[01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:27.460]   Android YouTube channel uploaded a 50 second video about how the OS is all about keeping
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:30.740]   you in all about keeping you and your information safe.
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.700]   I am all about that.
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:36.060]   So you can focus on what matters most.
[01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:39.580]   Even they did it in 15 seconds because they knew people would skip ahead.
[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:42.580]   Let's just see protected by Android.
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:44.860]   These people look very happy being there.
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:47.500]   Can we skip ahead to the most replayed part?
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:49.140]   Yeah, yeah, I agree with you.
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:50.980]   I'm bored already.
[01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:54.860]   I'm so bored.
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:56.580]   You know what's interesting about this video?
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:58.300]   There is no most replayed part.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:00.700]   All right, because there's only 15 seconds.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:02.220]   Nobody wants it.
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:03.220]   It's done.
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:04.220]   OK, thank you.
[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:05.220]   Bye.
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:07.140]   We just skipped the most replayed part.
[01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:08.140]   None.
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:13.420]   Google's AI powered interview warm up lets you practice answering job questions.
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:20.420]   Can't imagine anything I'd rather do.
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:22.980]   Me on Saturday nights, like instead of going out.
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:23.980]   Oh, man.
[01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:25.340]   I don't have a date.
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:27.020]   Maybe I'll do an interview warm up.
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:28.020]   Let's start.
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:29.020]   Let's start.
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:30.020]   Let's start practicing.
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:31.020]   OK, there we go.
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.020]   What do you want to practice for?
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:34.900]   Data analytics, e-commerce, IT support project management.
[01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:35.900]   Oh, UX design.
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:36.900]   They're a bit on it.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:37.900]   UX design.
[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:38.900]   All right.
[01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:39.900]   Five questions.
[01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:42.980]   When you're done, review your answers and discover insights.
[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:45.580]   You'll need to use your microphone to answer the questions.
[01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:46.580]   Oh, boy.
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:47.580]   Oh, boy.
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:48.580]   This is serious.
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:49.580]   That's a security problem.
[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:50.580]   Somebody's going to be listening to this.
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:53.980]   Let's practice an interview for UX design.
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:57.020]   Can you please tell me a bit about yourself?
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:47:00.780]   Um, I'm a podcaster.
[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:03.620]   Hit the answer.
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:05.860]   OK, what else?
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:10.260]   Wow, it's taken a long time to transcribe that answer.
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:12.460]   OK, thanks.
[01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:13.460]   Again?
[01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:14.460]   No.
[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:15.460]   Let's do another one.
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:18.340]   How did you get about a time when you had to act quickly but didn't have a lot of data
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:20.380]   to inform your decision?
[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:22.180]   What did you do and what was the outcome?
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:24.380]   I was crossing.
[01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:25.380]   You got to hit answer.
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:32.500]   I was crossing the street and a car was coming at me and I jumped out of the way.
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:35.700]   And the outcome was only got part of me.
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.260]   Got it.
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:38.260]   Thanks.
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:43.860]   What is the ideal outcome of a design sprint?
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:45.300]   OK, you answered this one.
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:50.060]   Somebody else, Shoshana, what is the ideal outcome of a design sprint?
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:53.340]   Uh, you just go fast.
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:55.340]   You just go fast and you do it hot.
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:56.820]   I have a design sprint.
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:58.660]   Do it as fast as you can.
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:00.300]   As wet as little as possible.
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:02.220]   As wet as little as possible.
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:04.780]   And hope you win.
[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:05.780]   Got it.
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:06.780]   Thanks.
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:07.780]   You're welcome.
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:08.780]   I wonder if it's going to--
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:13.980]   What approaches can you take to create well-defined UX research questions?
[01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:16.380]   Uh, I asked Shoshana.
[01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:17.380]   Got it.
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:18.380]   Thanks.
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:20.860]   Don't be about a time when you had to develop your skill.
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:21.860]   You could have to get the same question.
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:22.860]   How did you apply that question?
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:23.860]   Let me ask you that question.
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:25.860]   That's a good answer.
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:26.860]   Tell me.
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:27.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:28.860]   Can I go back?
[01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:29.860]   Let me do that when I--
[01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:30.860]   Can you redo?
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:31.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:32.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:33.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:37.900]   What approaches can you take to create well-defined UX research questions?
[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:39.940]   I'd like to ask you that question.
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:40.940]   OK.
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:41.940]   Thanks.
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:42.940]   Thank you.
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:43.940]   Thank you.
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:45.580]   You can't even answer you.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:47.620]   It doesn't-- it's so boring.
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:51.380]   Tell me about a time when you had to develop a new skill.
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:54.540]   Ant, tell me about that.
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:58.660]   I was painting and I wanted to watch it dry.
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:03.740]   And how did you approach that, Ant?
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:04.740]   Very carefully.
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:05.740]   Yes.
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:06.740]   And that's the right answer.
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:07.740]   Thank you.
[01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:08.740]   OK.
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:09.740]   Let's see.
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:10.740]   Congrats.
[01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:11.740]   You did it.
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:12.740]   Let's review.
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:13.740]   You want to save these answers?
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:14.740]   No.
[01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:15.740]   No.
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:16.740]   Right.
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:17.740]   Save them?
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:18.740]   OK.
[01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:19.740]   Your answer.
[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:20.740]   OK.
[01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:22.740]   What else you're taking a long time.
[01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:23.740]   OK.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:24.740]   What's the point?
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:25.740]   What is the point?
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:26.740]   Where's the inside?
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:27.740]   Where's the inside?
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:28.740]   Where's the inside?
[01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:29.740]   Where's the inside?
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:30.740]   Where's the inside?
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:31.740]   Where's the inside?
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:32.740]   Where's the inside?
[01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:33.740]   No, inside.
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:36.740]   No terms related to UX design.
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:38.740]   Oh, you did?
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:41.020]   I used SEO of your answer.
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:45.740]   I used-- I used the word was three more times, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:47.540]   Oh, this is pathetic.
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:51.460]   You suggested talking points for situational questions.
[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:52.460]   OK.
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:55.300]   It really has nothing to say.
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:50:04.020]   Click the talking points to get tips and see which ones you covered.
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:08.420]   Experience skills, lessons learned, talking points not detected.
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:11.380]   One example results not detected.
[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:12.380]   OK.
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:14.420]   I guess this would be kind of anyway.
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:18.020]   Yeah, I think I'd rather read termination shock than do that.
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:25.660]   I found video of you making your split decision, your fast decision there, Leo, line 155.
[01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:26.660]   This is--
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:27.660]   I'll play the whole thing.
[01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:28.660]   This is me making decisions fast.
[01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:30.660]   This is me making your fat when you cross the street.
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:31.660]   I cross the street.
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:33.140]   This is documentary evidence.
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:34.380]   What, keep watching, keep watching.
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:35.380]   Yeah.
[01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:36.380]   Oh.
[01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:37.780]   Oh, and keep watching more.
[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:38.780]   Oh.
[01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:39.780]   Oh.
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:40.780]   Dude.
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:41.780]   Dude.
[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:43.780]   And then keep watching.
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:44.780]   Keep watching.
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:45.780]   Oh.
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:46.780]   What?
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:52.300]   He had a car catch the car before it hit him.
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:54.300]   That was brilliant.
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:55.300]   That was really brilliant.
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:56.300]   Was that low key?
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:57.300]   And there he is.
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:58.300]   He's fine.
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:50:59.300]   Is that low key?
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:00.300]   Yeah, he walks again.
[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:01.300]   Yeah.
[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:02.300]   He's fine.
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.660]   So this car hits that car.
[01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:08.980]   For those of you not watching, guys crossing the street, car hits a car, goes flying at him.
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:09.980]   He looks like he got hit.
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:14.340]   But in fact, no, another car landed on his roof.
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:15.660]   And he can get ready.
[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:17.820]   He comes back to say, is everybody OK?
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:19.780]   Is anybody good hurt?
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:20.980]   Rather calmly, I think.
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:21.980]   He just walks back.
[01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:23.980]   I think that was almost getting in front of his shirt.
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:24.980]   He was squished.
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:25.980]   OK.
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:26.980]   Thank you.
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:27.980]   This looks like a scene out of that.
[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:28.980]   OK.
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:29.980]   Back to the change.
[01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:33.220]   What a wonderful distraction.
[01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:35.500]   Next hub Max is rolling out.
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:38.260]   Or remember that thing where they showed it at Google I/O?
[01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:39.260]   Mm-hmm.
[01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:44.060]   The woman was asking questions of her next hub Max.
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:49.700]   And instead of having to say, hey, gee, she just glared at it and answered the questions.
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:51.580]   That's called look and talk.
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:52.740]   And you can turn it on now.
[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:53.740]   Oh, good.
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:56.460]   Because I have my next hub Max at home.
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:52:00.540]   It's available in the Google Home app via a server side update.
[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:01.620]   Cool.
[01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:04.940]   The feature.
[01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:12.220]   Now I understand why she was glaring.
[01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:13.860]   The code name of the feature is blue steel.
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:17.780]   Go to the Google Home app to your next hub Max device settings and a recognition and
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:21.860]   sharing the features under the face match menu.
[01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:24.500]   And you can just turn on look and talk.
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:26.580]   See, there's a little toggle switch right there.
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:27.580]   We're looking talk.
[01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:29.380]   I would do that when I get home.
[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:30.940]   I wonder if you have to really glare at it.
[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:33.180]   Because she was like, if the glare doesn't work.
[01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:34.660]   We want video to your waist.
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:35.900]   All right, I'll try it.
[01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:40.180]   Finally, the Google Play system updates for May.
[01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:42.060]   Oh, exciting.
[01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:43.140]   Oh, man.
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:46.580]   Oh, Jason, you have outdone yourself with this change law.
[01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:49.380]   Oh, everybody share it itself.
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:51.980]   Here's my Cartier and check on my AFib here.
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:55.460]   A redesign for Google help and more.
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:55.940]   But we will.
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:57.900]   Oh, how exciting.
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:02.780]   And that's the Google change law.
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:09.740]   Here from an aptly named website tedium.co.
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:12.940]   A list of failed iPods.
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:14.020]   A little bit of memory here.
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:15.420]   Yeah.
[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:16.940]   This is the cane Kramer.
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:20.660]   Oh, these are players that never made it.
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.700]   Well, no, no, there's something that didn't make it.
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:23.780]   It's prior art.
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:24.740]   It's not big.
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:29.380]   King Kramer's IXI designed late '70s.
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:29.980]   Wow.
[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:31.100]   I didn't know about that.
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:35.340]   Yeah, I think this probably had to do with a patent lawsuit.
[01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:38.100]   Oh, actually, oh, get this.
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:40.500]   So this kid, who is 23 years old,
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:46.460]   did this sketch on paper of an idea for a player in the '70s
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:48.940]   that was very much like the iPod.
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:51.820]   He struggled to move his prototypes past the idea stage
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:54.020]   due to business challenges.
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:55.580]   When the time came to renew the patent,
[01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:56.340]   he didn't have the money.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:59.140]   Years later, Apple took advantage of this fact
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:03.300]   in the lawsuit citing Kramer's work as prior art,
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:05.260]   hiring him as a consultant.
[01:54:05.260 --> 01:54:06.100]   Wow.
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:07.780]   Oh, well, he finally made his payday.
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:08.620]   Yeah.
[01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:14.340]   Saying, see, see, your patent for the iPod came later.
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:18.700]   This is the AT&T Flash Pack digital music player,
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:21.180]   a barely released pre-MP3 music player.
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:24.260]   Kind of looks like a Walkman, right, with flash memory
[01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:27.700]   for the mid '90s.
[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:28.380]   I remember this.
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:29.940]   The Audible, it was awful.
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:32.020]   The Audible, had nothing to do with the Audible books.
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:35.300]   It just was the name Audible, 1997 Audible Mobile--
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:36.940]   Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait, go back.
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:37.620]   It was Audible.
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:38.900]   This is the Audible one.
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:40.500]   Audible words to go.
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:41.220]   Oh, it was.
[01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:43.180]   Which one you had to use their player.
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:45.140]   I do remember that, but I didn't realize--
[01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:46.100]   No, it was the Otis.
[01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:47.940]   Otis was the one I knew about.
[01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:48.900]   Oh, oh, that was a section.
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:49.820]   No, but you're right.
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:51.620]   This was for Audible.
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:52.180]   That was for Audible too.
[01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:54.820]   Audible.com, yeah, yeah, there it is.
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:55.580]   Wow.
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:58.340]   Yeah, I didn't have that.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:00.620]   Audible, Highway, Listen Up Player.
[01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:05.460]   From the late 1990s, pre-MP3 also.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:07.580]   That's the problem till MP3 came out.
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:08.220]   Ah, I had this one.
[01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:09.180]   This one, I remember well.
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:09.780]   I had it.
[01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:10.540]   The Diamond Rio.
[01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:13.980]   That's what I listened to my Audible books on for a long time.
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:16.860]   Diamond Rio, PMP300.
[01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:20.060]   I also had this, the Arco's-- remember the Arco's jukebox?
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:21.900]   You're probably not over the fan.
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:23.420]   This was a big one.
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:26.340]   Rubber corners, so you could throw it.
[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:28.220]   Shana, this is old man.
[01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:29.500]   I just all the time.
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:30.580]   I remember this.
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:32.100]   The creative zen, remember that?
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:33.940]   I remember that.
[01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:34.780]   And this is kind of fun.
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:36.260]   Microsoft Zune, whatever.
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:37.020]   I remember--
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:39.220]   Fun fact with Zune.
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:42.020]   When I talk to spammers and they ask me what kind of phone
[01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:46.140]   I have, I say Zune every time I do.
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:47.300]   And what do they say to that?
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:48.100]   Yeah?
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:48.420]   Yeah?
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:50.980]   They're just like, oh, OK, we'll open up your app store.
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:53.860]   And I'm like, so pammer.
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:54.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:57.860]   What app were they trying to get you to install?
[01:55:57.860 --> 01:56:00.980]   Usually those are some finance--
[01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:03.620]   Oh, so they said that you would transfer money to them,
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:04.300]   ultimately?
[01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:06.220]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:07.500]   Wow.
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.500]   So do you remember, Leo, I think you were there.
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:13.980]   It's out by Southwest when Kevin Rose was trying to give away
[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:15.460]   Zune players to his audience.
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:17.020]   And they all just basically booed him.
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:17.860]   It said no.
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:21.460]   Oh my gosh, that's amazing.
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:22.100]   We don't want it.
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:24.500]   We're not going to take it.
[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:25.140]   That's just terrible.
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:26.140]   That's so wholesome.
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:27.660]   They don't mention, though.
[01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:31.900]   It was like it was a young girl crazed thing
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:33.020]   that I had one of these.
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:35.300]   It clipped to the top of your shirt.
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:39.260]   And you had these tiny, almost like mini albums
[01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:40.140]   that you could slip in.
[01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:43.580]   And each one would play for about a minute,
[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:45.660]   a shortened version of the song.
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.020]   I forget what they were called.
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:49.860]   But it was a big thing for a month.
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:53.420]   And I wasted a decent amount for my parents' money on it.
[01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:56.180]   So it wasn't an mp3 player.
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:58.340]   It had little singles that you would pop in.
[01:56:58.340 --> 01:56:59.540]   Yeah.
[01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:00.180]   Wow.
[01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:00.900]   I don't remember that.
[01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:01.700]   Anybody in the chat room?
[01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:02.340]   Remember what that is?
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:03.780]   Remember the name of it?
[01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:04.100]   Music flips?
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:06.540]   It was early 2000s.
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:07.860]   Oh my goodness.
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:09.180]   What chicken answers?
[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:10.980]   You must be close to the same age as my daughter.
[01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:11.740]   She's 30.
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:13.020]   I don't think she had those.
[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:15.220]   But that's when she-- if she'd had it,
[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:17.220]   that's when she would have had it.
[01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:18.260]   Wow.
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:22.260]   So this was popular when you were growing up in Saudi Arabia.
[01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:23.220]   Where were you?
[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:24.780]   Yeah, I know.
[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:28.020]   On Long Island, a lot of us got it.
[01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:33.020]   And all the cool girls had these tiny crap things.
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:34.860]   It was kind of an interesting concept.
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:37.580]   But when you were like, oh man, things move past us.
[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:38.500]   Oh, we found it.
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:39.700]   Thank you.
[01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:40.900]   Thank you, Skuderex.
[01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:41.940]   Skuderex and Adam, to me before.
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:45.420]   In fact, he's not only found it, he's found a place you can buy one
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:46.020]   right now.
[01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:46.740]   Should we get it?
[01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:47.580]   How much?
[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:48.220]   Let's see.
[01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:49.860]   Let's go to eBay.
[01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:51.020]   Let's go to the listing.
[01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:51.340]   It never fails.
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:53.060]   $192.
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:54.380]   But wait a minute.
[01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:56.420]   It's not just one.
[01:57:56.420 --> 01:57:58.580]   It looks like-- is this what you're talking about?
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:57:59.500]   Yes.
[01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:02.060]   And look at all the music you get.
[01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:05.140]   Aaron Carter, I want candy.
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:05.820]   Remember that one?
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:07.500]   I want candy.
[01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:10.020]   Hillary Duff, why not?
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:13.100]   Britney Spears, oops, I did it again.
[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:17.420]   You can totally identify where the era from this.
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:18.300]   Hanson.
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:21.700]   Backstreet boys, shape of my heart.
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:22.060]   Oh, wow.
[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:23.540]   Pink.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:24.860]   Is it most girls?
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:27.420]   Wow, this is great.
[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:30.700]   All right, $192 seems a little pricey.
[01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:33.580]   Should I just make an offer?
[01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:34.900]   Because I'm going to offer--
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:36.620]   Don't you want this, Shoshana?
[01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:38.660]   Offer them $2.
[01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:38.940]   I do.
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:42.700]   So I have an N64.
[01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:44.740]   I had a toss at it, finally.
[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:46.420]   I didn't take care of it.
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:48.780]   But I have the controllers.
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:51.580]   So I obviously tied one to my face at one point
[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:53.220]   to make N95 jokes.
[01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:55.260]   You know, you can't even move on your house
[01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:58.140]   without your N64.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.940]   You're terrible.
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:00.940]   I know.
[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:02.260]   It's so awful.
[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:03.820]   Oh, my god.
[01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:05.340]   Oh, my god.
[01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:08.060]   So what-- OK, so I get this yellow thing is the player.
[01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:10.620]   That's what you clip to your shirt.
[01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:11.780]   What are these big boom boxes?
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:13.340]   One of those little boom boxes.
[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:14.620]   Oh, I don't remember, though.
[01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:16.660]   Because maybe those were another version of it.
[01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:18.180]   Like maybe my parents weren't freaking out
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:20.060]   to buy me the real tight-rack.
[01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:21.580]   They didn't get you the real one.
[01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:23.700]   Oh, the better it still comes out at her voice.
[01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:24.140]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:24.700]   No, we could just--
[01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:25.540]   Parents.
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:31.220]   We could just get the $37 for the red one plus three
[01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:33.180]   Simpsons clips.
[01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:36.300]   Homer, Bart, and People of Springfield.
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:38.300]   Oh, I didn't know that was an option.
[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:40.620]   Well, so these weren't very long, right?
[01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:42.300]   Two minutes or something?
[01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:44.100]   Yeah, yeah, about there.
[01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:45.340]   So surprise.
[01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:46.300]   Don't--
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.100]   No, over and over.
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:49.860]   Over and over again.
[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:50.940]   Wow.
[01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:54.820]   This has 17 song clips, two boom box players.
[01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:56.300]   Yeah, those are the fancy one.
[01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:59.100]   Two personal players.
[01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:01.180]   Wow.
[02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:03.620]   Oh, and look, Disney even had them.
[02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:07.620]   This is Disney's tune kit flips--
[02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:07.980]   Oh, my god.
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:09.500]   Tiger electronic jungle book--
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:10.100]   Capitalism.
[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:12.420]   --retro music player.
[02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:14.460]   Wow, I missed this whole thing.
[02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:15.180]   Boy, yeah.
[02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:15.660]   Lucky ass.
[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:16.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:18.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:21.860]   This was a very brief moment in time.
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:23.820]   It was really, really the golden age.
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:26.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:31.980]   Who were-- what boy band were you into?
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:33.100]   So here's the funny thing.
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:34.380]   I didn't like music then.
[02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:35.380]   I just wanted them.
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:36.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:37.500]   I just wanted--
[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:38.900]   I had--
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:39.820]   Yeah, I had Madonna.
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:40.900]   Oh, I've always been a geek.
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:41.540]   But like--
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:44.380]   You hadn't met SpongeBob yet, so--
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:47.740]   It was around that time that I met SpongeBob.
[02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:48.180]   OK.
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:51.620]   But it's-- I didn't always get into fads.
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:53.700]   But the ones I did, I was very big on.
[02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:57.740]   And like, whether it be Pokemon or that, it was--
[02:00:57.740 --> 02:00:59.100]   I really wanted it.
[02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:00.140]   And it was Madonna.
[02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:02.300]   It was-- I forgot which song.
[02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:05.300]   But I'm like, yes, I'm listening to Madonna.
[02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:06.700]   I don't like Madonna.
[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:09.500]   But I do have her clip to my collar.
[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:09.900]   Yeah.
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:10.420]   Wow.
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:11.060]   Yeah.
[02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:11.660]   And that's what we--
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:12.620]   It was very useful.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:15.780]   You know, that minute, minute, 50 seconds every now and then,
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:18.100]   you know?
[02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:19.900]   [SIGH]
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:22.500]   Is there anything I missed in the rundowns
[02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:26.060]   that anybody really cared a lot about?
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:27.180]   Because God knows I didn't.
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:29.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:32.540]   Thanks to my eternal--
[02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:34.220]   Once you did none, TikTok.
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:34.740]   None of them.
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:35.020]   What else did you do?
[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:36.420]   I really brought it down.
[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:37.540]   I got to tell you.
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:38.980]   All right, let's take a little break.
[02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:43.220]   I'm going to have the week coming up in just a bit.
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:47.460]   But first, I am going to close out the FCCs.
[02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:48.860]   Here we go.
[02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:50.500]   This episode of This Week in Google
[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:53.660]   is brought to you by HP GreenLake, orchestrated
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:55.940]   by the experts at CDW.
[02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:57.820]   Yesterday's infrastructure is not
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:00.940]   going to help you meet the demands of tomorrow's innovation.
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:02.740]   And that, now more than ever, you
[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:05.500]   have to quickly adapt to change.
[02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:07.700]   The consumption-oriented model of public cloud
[02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:10.180]   is revolutionized how organizations
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:11.980]   think about infrastructure.
[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:14.220]   And organizations are now demanding
[02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:18.380]   speed and agility of a public cloud experience.
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:20.380]   But many workloads remain on-prem.
[02:02:20.380 --> 02:02:21.180]   You know why?
[02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:24.940]   Complicated legacy applications, data sovereignty issues,
[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:27.140]   compliance issues, and of course,
[02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:30.980]   the challenge and gravity of migrating sensitive data.
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:32.780]   And if you're in the IT department,
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:34.420]   you know you're caught right in the middle of this,
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:37.300]   trying to satisfy the demands, the growth
[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:41.260]   of your organization, while struggling to manage disparate data.
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:42.860]   And expected to do it all at budget.
[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:44.820]   I'm sure you've been saying, I want to go in the cloud.
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:45.940]   Please, can we move this to the cloud?
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:49.540]   Well, HP GreenLake and CDW can provide
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:51.900]   a seamless, scalable cloud experience

[02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:59.660]   no matter where your data and applications live on-prem,
[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:02.180]   public, and private clouds.
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:03.700]   Yes, you can have all three.

[02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:44.540]   Thank you, CDW and HPE for your support of Twig.
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:47.340]   Now, I don't know if anybody warned you, Shoshana,
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:49.660]   but we give everybody a chance to pick something
[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:50.620]   they're excited about.
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:52.140]   It could have been just those clips,
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:55.220]   if that's what rocks your boat.
[02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:57.380]   Is there anything else you'd like to share with us
[02:04:57.380 --> 02:04:59.500]   to tell the world about?
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:02.460]   Well, actually related to the ad, I love automation.
[02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:05.540]   I'm having a grand old time in Integromat,
[02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:08.060]   automating internal stuff for our street.
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:11.420]   No one else on my organization has any idea what I'm doing,
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:13.460]   but it's really, really fun.
[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:16.460]   So automating processes?
[02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:20.660]   Yeah, so I had one automation
[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:23.380]   that every time we got a media mention or an op-ed.
[02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:25.260]   So basically we got an alert that we're in the news
[02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:27.780]   somewhere, whether we're creating it or we're in it.
[02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:29.580]   So I had an automation that said, okay,
[02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:32.100]   does the author match one of our scholar names?
[02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:35.380]   If yes, it's an op-ed, if no, it's a media mention,
[02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:37.660]   then I have a reg X to find the name
[02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:39.660]   within the media mention if it exists.
[02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:41.500]   And then it'll tag appropriately,
[02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:43.940]   it updates custom fields,
[02:05:43.940 --> 02:05:46.180]   throws everything in, it's fun.
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:49.300]   It's normally Integromat, now called make.
[02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:52.060]   They change their names, darn them.
[02:05:52.060 --> 02:05:54.900]   I use in a more primitive way,
[02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:56.900]   I use Zapier to do stuff like that.
[02:05:56.900 --> 02:05:58.820]   That's mostly what I use.
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:06:03.500]   I need to use Integromat/make for some more complex things
[02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:04.860]   because Zapier is amazing.
[02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:06.820]   I'm a huge, huge fan of them.
[02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:08.180]   And they've been really helpful
[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:10.220]   when I ask them dumb questions.
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:12.620]   But, and I find it more user friendly,
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:15.540]   but there are some data limits that even if you have
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:18.180]   the highest Zapier plan, you're not able to do it.
[02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:21.620]   But I spent, we have 50 automations
[02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:23.140]   that do so many different things.
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:24.900]   And I'm just having a blast
[02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:26.540]   figuring out how stuff works.
[02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:28.580]   And everyone's like, have fun, I guess.
[02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:29.700]   - So it's like, you're using it
[02:06:29.700 --> 02:06:32.380]   kind of like a clipping service almost.
[02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:33.220]   - Ah, sort of.
[02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:34.060]   So that's part of it.
[02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:34.900]   I do other things too.
[02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:36.100]   It sends me reminders.
[02:06:36.100 --> 02:06:39.620]   It sends out newsletters and automated emails.
[02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:43.780]   It takes data, it organizes some of our internal systems.
[02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:47.620]   It's easily like one human at our organization.
[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:50.420]   - So, that's this impressive.
[02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:52.220]   Are you use, and use grep?
[02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:53.100]   Are you a coder?
[02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:54.580]   Are you a programmer?
[02:06:54.580 --> 02:06:56.940]   - No, I'm bad at learning languages.
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:59.540]   Whether like regular languages or code,
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:00.460]   I'm really bad at it.
[02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:02.620]   So I just kind of like, figure out what I need.
[02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:05.540]   I grab code from like, you know, stack overflow
[02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:07.260]   and stuff like that as I need.
[02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:08.100]   But it's why I like the puzzle.
[02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:08.940]   - Well, that's what everybody does.
[02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:10.340]   - Yeah, that's what the problem is.
[02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:11.660]   - Yeah, that's what the problem is.
[02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:14.580]   (both laughing)
[02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:15.420]   - Very cool.
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:18.060]   We're gonna say Integramat is your pick of the week.
[02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:20.580]   Although again, I use Zapier, but that's okay.
[02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:21.460]   It's okay.
[02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:22.340]   - I use Zapier as well.
[02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:25.700]   - Yeah, we actually use Zapier in a much more primitive way
[02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:26.540]   than you're using.
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:28.740]   It sounds like you're doing some really fancy stuff.
[02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:31.020]   But that's how we build these run downs.
[02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:36.020]   When I select stories, Zapier takes it from my RSS feed
[02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:39.020]   or my pin-borne puts it into a spreadsheet.
[02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:39.860]   - Yeah.
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:40.700]   - It's really cool.
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:41.540]   - Yeah.
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:43.220]   - I love, I'm a big automation fan.
[02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:44.060]   Yeah.
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:45.500]   - It's not used enough.
[02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:47.900]   You know, I know that like, there's group,
[02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:50.180]   there's political groups in America who hate the idea
[02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:52.580]   like automation, they worry it takes away jobs.
[02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:55.340]   But like for me and my employee gets to do more interesting
[02:07:55.340 --> 02:07:58.220]   work, which I automate some of her dollar tasks.
[02:07:58.220 --> 02:08:00.420]   And then I teach her how to build it for herself
[02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:02.220]   so she can build out more stuff.
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:04.740]   And she sort of understands what I'm doing,
[02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:07.460]   but other than her, everyone like understands
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:10.460]   what is being done, but has no idea how I'm doing it.
[02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:13.260]   And just like lets me, which I'm very thankful for.
[02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:15.420]   - As the CEO that I was talking about earlier
[02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:17.500]   that bought that peninsula,
[02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:19.180]   he has to say stuff like, you know what,
[02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:22.620]   let's get automation going because I want the staff
[02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:25.740]   to be doing things that require brain power.
[02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:26.580]   - Yeah.
[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:27.420]   - He was, he was.
[02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:29.100]   - Yeah, let the computers do the stupid stuff,
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:31.220]   the repetitive stuff, the boring stuff
[02:08:31.220 --> 02:08:33.060]   so that you can do the interesting creative stuff.
[02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:35.500]   That's the whole point of automation.
[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:38.340]   I was kind of hoping you'd come up with a bunch of section 230
[02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:39.820]   merchandise actually, but.
[02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:42.300]   (laughing)
[02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:44.700]   - I know, I own so much.
[02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:47.820]   Oh, actually so for the hairpins, I had enough made
[02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:51.740]   that I think after the second one, the Etsy seller was like,
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:54.460]   all right, what does S230 mean?
[02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:55.940]   (laughing)
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:57.340]   I explained it to her and she's like,
[02:08:57.340 --> 02:08:58.540]   oh yeah, I'm on board with that.
[02:08:58.540 --> 02:08:59.380]   Like, it's great.
[02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:00.220]   - Oh yeah, I'm totally all about that.
[02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:01.040]   - Yeah.
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:03.060]   - And you give me a whole new business.
[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:04.020]   - Well. - Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:06.620]   - So does she sell them now on,
[02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:08.420]   or you're the only customer?
[02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:12.380]   - So she doesn't, like you have to request S230,
[02:09:12.380 --> 02:09:15.380]   but she'll make it for you and they're pretty good.
[02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:17.700]   You can wear them to normal events,
[02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:22.700]   like meeting Chris Cox for speaking about section 230.
[02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:24.980]   - Wow, I'm really impressed.
[02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:26.140]   That's good.
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:31.140]   She's custom designed S230 hairpins, very nice.
[02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:35.380]   - I just got.
[02:09:35.380 --> 02:09:37.420]   - I'm looking for them on, I don't see them,
[02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:39.780]   but I'm looking for them on the Etsy.
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:42.700]   - Yeah, you just have the, what's it called?
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:46.620]   Like, you type in like glitter hairpins or whatever,
[02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:48.380]   and then you just ask for a custom.
[02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:49.220]   - And they'll do it.
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:50.060]   - Yeah, of course.
[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:52.660]   - Yeah, I actually asked for the section symbol.
[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:55.340]   I'm like, is there a new way you can like cut to us?
[02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:56.660]   - Oh, isn't that cool?
[02:09:56.660 --> 02:09:58.420]   - She was like, I'm not doing that.
[02:09:58.420 --> 02:09:59.260]   I'm like, that's fair.
[02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:02.340]   - I'm gonna get these glitter hair clips,
[02:10:02.340 --> 02:10:04.380]   they're flamingos, but I might get,
[02:10:04.380 --> 02:10:07.700]   I might like with a pen right S230 on the way.
[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:08.540]   - Oh, I like that.
[02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:10.060]   - Yeah, flamingos 230.
[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:13.340]   - Yeah, that'd be good, it'd be a S230 flamingo.
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:16.500]   You can't prove it, you're pick of the weeks.
[02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:22.100]   - Mine, let's see, I wanted to shout out some value lighting
[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:26.460]   because I did a photograph a while back and.
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:28.180]   - You're the king of photographic lighting,
[02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:30.060]   you've done some really interesting stuff.
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:30.900]   - Thank you.
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:33.380]   - Yeah, I really like your, you see a lot of these on hop,
[02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:35.860]   but also on your Instagram and other places, yeah.
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:36.860]   - Thank you.
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:41.860]   - But the Godox or Godox SL60W are some LED lights,
[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:46.420]   they're constant light, you have to plug them in,
[02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:49.340]   but they just flat out work, they're not the brightest.
[02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:50.580]   - They're not super expensive.
[02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:53.500]   - Right, and they just work,
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:56.540]   you don't have to spend a gazillion dollars on lights
[02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:58.580]   all the time, granted there are reasons
[02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:00.100]   that you need to spend a little bit more.
[02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:02.780]   - Would these be appropriate for video or just more?
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:04.060]   - You could use these for video.
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:05.780]   - Video or product photography
[02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:08.140]   'cause a lot of product photography just requires
[02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:10.540]   enough light that's coming out of that.
[02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:15.540]   So what I use that to light part of the shot
[02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:20.540]   in the next thing in my pick, which is a high key.
[02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:24.180]   So I use those with the reflectors to light the background
[02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:26.700]   because I needed the background to be nice and easy.
[02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:28.580]   - Oh, I love this shot, I saw this shot.
[02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:31.260]   - Now, Granite, the main light that's on him,
[02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:32.820]   that's a more expensive light,
[02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:35.500]   and it's a Stella Pro CLX10 light.
[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:37.020]   I'm not mentioning that there
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:39.620]   'cause it's very expensive and I know most people can't buy it,
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:42.660]   but I just wanted to show that those go-down slights,
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:45.140]   they're really good for pretty much what we need.
[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:48.780]   - For highlights, for airlights, things like that.
[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:50.700]   They look like they have one with a softbox,
[02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:52.580]   that might be kind of good for video.
[02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:54.020]   - It has a bow and sound on it,
[02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:56.140]   so you can put a softbox on the front of it.
[02:11:56.140 --> 02:11:57.380]   - Yeah, see, that would be,
[02:11:57.380 --> 02:11:58.780]   then you'd have that be good for video.
[02:11:58.780 --> 02:12:00.820]   They have a nice soft,
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:04.980]   - With the grid, so the light doesn't spill everywhere else.
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:06.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:09.340]   - It's good stuff and it's all value priced.
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:13.140]   My last pick of the week is just a shout out
[02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:14.260]   to Mr. Derek Blank.
[02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:19.260]   He's an amazing content creator and creative designer.
[02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:22.940]   And this clip here, it's beautiful, now Granite,
[02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:24.580]   it's about 40 seconds long,
[02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:28.460]   but you have him walk it into this rain shot
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:30.220]   with this beautiful suit.
[02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:33.620]   But if you look closer, he's gonna pause
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:35.900]   and you'll get all of the details of the water
[02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:38.340]   'cause he's using a nice high end camera.
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:39.980]   But watch the water droplets.
[02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:40.900]   - Off his head.
[02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:41.740]   - Whoa.
[02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:42.580]   - Oh, they're going backwards.
[02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:45.540]   - They're going back, but just keep watching.
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:47.020]   The water's starting to recede,
[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:49.180]   but watch the transition from the blue suit.
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:50.740]   - Oh, look at that.
[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:52.580]   He is so good, he and his team,
[02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:53.580]   they're so good at--
[02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:54.420]   - That's pretty cool.
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:55.260]   - They're green screen.
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:56.100]   - That's very cool.
[02:12:56.100 --> 02:12:57.060]   - And video effects.
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:12:59.780]   And I can do a more effect, but that right there,
[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:01.780]   I was like, okay, all right, yee, yee, yee,
[02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:02.940]   I can't touch that, man.
[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:03.780]   - That's nice.
[02:13:03.780 --> 02:13:04.620]   (laughs)
[02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:05.460]   - It's fun.
[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:07.620]   - More effect and reverse the rain drops.
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:09.580]   Just absolutely beautiful.
[02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:11.300]   He's pretty inspirational.
[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:13.940]   Every time I see him, I think about the hard head
[02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:16.540]   because the hard head sort of acts like him
[02:13:16.540 --> 02:13:19.780]   and I told him, I said, look, he does internships.
[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:22.180]   - Oh, be a good internship.
[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:23.540]   - So stay on his radar.
[02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:24.380]   - Yeah.
[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:25.940]   - Look at the drops going backwards.
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:26.780]   That's the stuff.
[02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:27.700]   - Yeah, the water's going back.
[02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:28.700]   - Yeah, love it.
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:30.700]   Beautiful work.
[02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:32.980]   And of course you could follow Ant's beautiful work.
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:36.740]   Ant underscore Pruitt on the Insta.
[02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:37.860]   - Yes, please, please.
[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:39.420]   - You really like that Insta.
[02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:42.660]   Well, it's photography.
[02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:43.660]   - It's photography.
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:45.740]   - Photography, no, granted, there's a lot more video
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:46.740]   showing up in there now.
[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:50.540]   So you'll see me shooting more video content on there,
[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:52.820]   but it's photography.
[02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:54.660]   I see a lot of beautiful images there.
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:55.860]   - That's nice.
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:56.780]   - Thank you.
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:58.380]   - Thank you, Ant Pruitt.
[02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:00.740]   Jeff Jarvis, you got a number for us?
[02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:02.140]   - Well, first I got a pin.
[02:14:02.140 --> 02:14:02.980]   I got this.
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:03.820]   - What's that?
[02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:04.900]   Is it a section 230 pin?
[02:14:04.900 --> 02:14:05.740]   - You can't see it.
[02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:09.340]   No, it's a line of type 25-year service pin.
[02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:10.180]   - Look at you.
[02:14:10.180 --> 02:14:11.020]   Nerd.
[02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:12.700]   - Wait a minute, you gotta earn that, man.
[02:14:12.700 --> 02:14:14.300]   You can't buy that on eBay.
[02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:15.820]   What are you doing with that?
[02:14:15.820 --> 02:14:17.660]   That's no good.
[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:19.500]   Line of 25 years of service.
[02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:22.380]   - So I worked with a story about
[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:25.260]   nanobots cleaning your teeth, but that was too--
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:26.100]   - Ew.
[02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:27.740]   - So instead--
[02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:28.580]   - That sounds like--
[02:14:28.580 --> 02:14:30.140]   - This would be funny, but it's not.
[02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:30.980]   So I just wanna warn you,
[02:14:30.980 --> 02:14:32.980]   'cause before we have hilarity.
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:34.540]   - Oh no, this is terrible.
[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:35.380]   - Yes.
[02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:36.220]   - It is.
[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:38.940]   Grubhub yesterday from 11 to two in New York
[02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:43.140]   did a $15 off order, warning no restaurants,
[02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:46.020]   and they got or delivery drivers.
[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:47.980]   They didn't tell any of the delivery people either.
[02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:49.380]   - Well, nobody.
[02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:51.860]   - So one restaurant lower down Buzzfeed article
[02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:55.660]   said that there were 6,000 orders a minute.
[02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:56.500]   - Dude.
[02:14:56.500 --> 02:14:57.860]   - One restaurant received 200 orders
[02:14:57.860 --> 02:14:58.820]   in the first five minutes.
[02:14:58.820 --> 02:14:59.980]   They didn't know what was happening.
[02:14:59.980 --> 02:15:01.940]   It was just spitting out of the machine.
[02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:04.660]   They were making food, they couldn't get delivered,
[02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:06.940]   they were not getting paid.
[02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:10.180]   - Wait a minute, who pays the 15 bucks, Grubhub?
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:11.500]   - Evidently the restaurant.
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:12.340]   - What?
[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:13.180]   - Oh, son.
[02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:14.420]   - Oh no, sorry.
[02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:17.500]   You don't get to give away $15 of my food without telling me.
[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:18.940]   - I guess it might be part of a deal
[02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:21.100]   that we can do occasional deals or something.
[02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:21.940]   - Oh.
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:24.820]   - And because they fenced it in a given time,
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:27.180]   then it was guaranteed to go crazy.
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:29.820]   And hey, it's New York.
[02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:30.660]   We like a bargain.
[02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:32.100]   We know bargains, it's New York.
[02:15:32.100 --> 02:15:33.660]   So.
[02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:35.780]   - Oh, you should see the tweets.
[02:15:35.780 --> 02:15:37.940]   Currently working front of house at a restaurant in Brooklyn,
[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:39.340]   you guys messed up big time.
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:43.100]   We have over 30 cold orders not being picked up by drivers
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:45.980]   and our phones are off the hook with angry customers
[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:48.820]   screwing over the entire New York City service industry.
[02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:49.820]   - Wow.
[02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:51.260]   - What jerks.
[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:52.540]   - This is really jerking.
[02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:54.140]   - And it doesn't come out of their pocket.
[02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:55.940]   That's what's really annoying.
[02:15:55.940 --> 02:15:58.980]   - Yeah, well, there should be a class action.
[02:15:58.980 --> 02:16:00.340]   - 'Cause the restaurant pays for it.
[02:16:00.340 --> 02:16:02.300]   - All the outraged customers.
[02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:04.020]   That's the worst of it in a way.
[02:16:04.020 --> 02:16:05.100]   - Yeah.
[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:06.780]   Reputation screwed up.
[02:16:06.780 --> 02:16:08.900]   The restaurant's reputation screwed up now
[02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:11.820]   because of something beyond their control.
[02:16:11.820 --> 02:16:14.020]   - Not to mention the food waste.
[02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:15.100]   - That. - Yeah.
[02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:17.500]   - Yeah, which is offensive at a time of inflation.
[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:18.940]   And yeah, yeah.
[02:16:18.940 --> 02:16:20.020]   Unbelievable.
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:24.700]   That's very disappointing.
[02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:26.020]   Very disappointing.
[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:28.060]   - Well, but not even saying a downer.
[02:16:28.060 --> 02:16:30.100]   We could talk about nanobots that are gonna clean back to her.
[02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:31.740]   - That's a downer even in other ways.
[02:16:31.740 --> 02:16:32.740]   I don't wanna talk about that.
[02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:33.860]   - Oh, okay, you don't wanna talk about that.
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:37.180]   - But I do wanna talk about my latest eBay purchase.
[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:40.420]   - Oh boy. - Oh boy.
[02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:41.780]   - Oh boy.
[02:16:41.780 --> 02:16:43.780]   - Oh God, what's that about?
[02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:46.540]   - I'm Shoshana, from a couple of episodes ago,
[02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:50.700]   we discovered that in fact eBay was a trove
[02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:55.700]   of valuable, undiscovered, valuable photos.
[02:16:55.700 --> 02:16:57.020]   - You're able to tear that plastic.
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:16:59.620]   - This is very well protected.
[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:00.620]   Geez, Louise.
[02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:02.020]   - I mean, I love eBay.
[02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:04.220]   I spent, I love spending time on eBay.
[02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:05.460]   - Oh, absolutely.
[02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:07.420]   - Since I was a kid, it's like a problem.
[02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:08.900]   - And when I found out--
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:10.700]   - Glenn Fleischman tweeted that there were
[02:17:10.700 --> 02:17:14.740]   Jeff Jarvis publicity photos on eBay.
[02:17:14.740 --> 02:17:16.660]   - When I found out I could wear a--
[02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:18.940]   - This photo for only $5.
[02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:21.420]   (laughing)
[02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:23.820]   - And Grubhub gave me a $15 coupon,
[02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:26.900]   and I bought a thousand of them.
[02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:29.860]   So we're just gonna have him all over the studio.
[02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:30.700]   - I had his boots.
[02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:31.700]   - That's really great.
[02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:33.740]   (laughing)
[02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:35.660]   And then I also got this one,
[02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:38.140]   where he's posing with his favorite comic, Billy Crystal.
[02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:43.140]   So it's just a wonderful collection of photographic art.
[02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:45.940]   - So I got a whole box of the first issue
[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:47.140]   of Edward and him a weekly.
[02:17:47.140 --> 02:17:49.140]   - Oh, what did you think I should sell them for?
[02:17:49.140 --> 02:17:49.980]   - Yeah, what did you want?
[02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:50.820]   What did you want to do?
[02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:51.660]   What did you want to do?
[02:17:51.660 --> 02:17:52.500]   - I don't know.
[02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:53.340]   - I could find some.
[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:54.180]   - What do you think?
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:55.020]   - It's a great photo though.
[02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:56.380]   - I don't know.
[02:17:56.380 --> 02:17:59.780]   I don't, I used to start collecting mad magazines,
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:01.900]   and then I decided that was a dumb idea.
[02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:05.420]   So, but these have more valuable, I don't know,
[02:18:05.420 --> 02:18:08.260]   like started a hundred thousand see where it goes.
[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:09.420]   (laughing)
[02:18:09.420 --> 02:18:10.620]   - Or best offer.
[02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:11.460]   - That's a capital.
[02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:12.460]   - Yeah, or best offer.
[02:18:12.460 --> 02:18:13.460]   - Or best offer.
[02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:15.820]   A million dollars or best offer.
[02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:17.020]   - I think it's the way to do it.
[02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:18.100]   - I completely agree.
[02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:19.300]   - Signed by the editor.
[02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:20.620]   - Yeah.
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:23.020]   - If you're a Mad Magazine fan, Shoshana,
[02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:24.340]   you probably don't know this,
[02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:26.340]   but Mad's madest rated Dick D. Bartolo
[02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:28.780]   does a regular show on our network every week.
[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:29.780]   - It's a genius.
[02:18:29.780 --> 02:18:30.820]   - Oh, that's awesome.
[02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:31.740]   - Yeah, and he is.
[02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:33.700]   - I used to love Mad TV too.
[02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:36.220]   I was the biggest Michael McDonald fan,
[02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:39.100]   and like now since I have a lot of followers on Twitter,
[02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:41.140]   I could be friends with like anyone.
[02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:44.100]   So I'm like, oh my gosh, this Michael McDonald,
[02:18:44.100 --> 02:18:45.500]   I loved you doing Stewart.
[02:18:45.500 --> 02:18:46.340]   - So that's how it works.
[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:47.500]   - It really spends like my fame,
[02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:48.900]   my tiny amount of fame.
[02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:50.740]   I'm like, I'm gonna be friends.
[02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:52.140]   - I gotta understand this.
[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:53.420]   You get to be friends with anyone.
[02:18:53.420 --> 02:18:55.820]   If you have how many followers do you have to have
[02:18:55.820 --> 02:18:58.220]   to be friends with anyone on Twitter?
[02:18:58.220 --> 02:19:00.540]   - I don't know, just more than they do, I think.
[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:02.580]   (laughing)
[02:19:02.580 --> 02:19:03.420]   - Fair enough.
[02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:04.380]   - That seems fair.
[02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:07.620]   Senator Shoshana on Twitter,
[02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:10.380]   she's your everybody's favorite senator
[02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:12.340]   from East Virginia.
[02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:14.740]   And Sloth Committee Chair,
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:18.620]   wow, I did not know there was a sloth emoji in the world.
[02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:19.460]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:19:19.460 --> 02:19:21.220]   And they chose the right kind of sloth.
[02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:23.020]   There's actually six subtypes.
[02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:23.860]   - She probably did.
[02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:26.460]   - And yeah, yeah, I tried.
[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:28.140]   I actually talked with the person doing it.
[02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:29.020]   I'm like, do you need help?
[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:33.220]   Like can I like help move this along?
[02:19:33.220 --> 02:19:35.340]   And they had it down, so I didn't.
[02:19:35.340 --> 02:19:36.260]   - I love it.

[02:21:46.700 --> 02:21:49.340]   Tomorrow, nine AM Pacific.
[02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:51.060]   The Stacey's Book Club this month,
[02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:55.140]   as Aunt referred to earlier, is termination shock.
[02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:56.500]   Are you still reading it or did you give up?
[02:21:56.500 --> 02:21:57.500]   - I'm still reading it.
[02:21:57.500 --> 02:21:59.340]   I haven't read it in a couple of days
[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:01.300]   because I've been in a bit of a bad mood
[02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:02.900]   and I didn't think that was--
[02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:05.220]   - It's on my list, I gotta finish the trip-mickle interview.
[02:22:05.220 --> 02:22:09.220]   I'm doing after Steve, trip-mickle's book about Apple,
[02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:14.220]   tomorrow on a special triangulation, 130 Pacific on Twitch.tv.
[02:22:14.220 --> 02:22:18.020]   We should also have the club in there for that as well.
[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:20.380]   Alex Lindsey asked me anything next month,
[02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:21.300]   that'll be fun. - Thank you.
[02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:22.660]   - If you're not a member of Club Twitch,
[02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:25.580]   you really ought to join ad-free versions of all the shows,
[02:22:25.580 --> 02:22:28.300]   which shortens them I might add by about an hour and a half each.
[02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:30.340]   So it's worth it just for your time.
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:32.060]   Just for the time savings.
[02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:33.820]   You also get access to the Discord,
[02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:36.220]   which is a great, wonderful community.
[02:22:36.220 --> 02:22:37.980]   Lots of fun, not just the shows,
[02:22:37.980 --> 02:22:41.980]   but all kinds of topics, including cryptocurrency,
[02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:46.220]   anime, gaming, ham radio, philosophy and science.
[02:22:46.220 --> 02:22:48.060]   - Beer. - Beer, travel.
[02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:51.220]   And the trip plus feed, which has stuff
[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:52.300]   that doesn't make it on the show,
[02:22:52.300 --> 02:22:55.260]   including Dick D. Bartolo's fabulous Giz Fizz,
[02:22:55.260 --> 02:22:57.700]   Stacey's book club, the Untitled Linux Show,
[02:22:57.700 --> 02:22:58.540]   and a lot more.
[02:22:58.540 --> 02:23:03.220]   We also use the club to promote new shows
[02:23:03.220 --> 02:23:05.460]   like This Week in Space, which you started in the club.
[02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:07.740]   We've got a new show coming with somebody you know
[02:23:07.740 --> 02:23:08.780]   that's gonna be very exciting.
[02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:10.140]   We're gonna start that in the club.
[02:23:10.140 --> 02:23:12.740]   Club members a chance to support that
[02:23:12.740 --> 02:23:14.380]   before we can get ad support for it.
[02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:16.380]   So it's important, it really helps us out.
[02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:19.060]   Twit.tv/club, twit.
[02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:23.140]   And don't forget, we also have dancing sloths in the club.
[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:28.140]   So it's a lot more fun to be in the club than not.
[02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:29.580]   Twit.t is seven bucks a month.
[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:30.420]   - I say that's seven bucks a month.
[02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:31.980]   - Fastest move in sloth. - Look at that.
[02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:32.940]   No sloth ever.
[02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:35.220]   That's probably sped up, that's over a period of months.
[02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:36.060]   Oh, okay.
[02:23:36.060 --> 02:23:37.820]   Twit.tv/club.
[02:23:37.820 --> 02:23:40.620]   - Looks like that sloth is at the Amazon store.
[02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:42.700]   - It does, doesn't walk out with just a grab and go.
[02:23:42.700 --> 02:23:43.540]   - Just a grab and go, print.
[02:23:43.540 --> 02:23:44.980]   - Grab and go sloth, which is good.
[02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:46.460]   - I'm sorry you have two.
[02:23:46.460 --> 02:23:47.740]   - A couple of claws.
[02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:48.580]   Yeah.
[02:23:48.580 --> 02:23:52.300]   We do this show every Wednesday, 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m.
[02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:54.900]   Eastern 2100 UTC, you can tune in,
[02:23:54.900 --> 02:23:58.500]   watch it happen live at live.twit.tv.
[02:23:58.500 --> 02:24:03.140]   Or after the fact, twit.tv/twig on the website.
[02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:04.940]   We have a YouTube channel dedicated to the show
[02:24:04.940 --> 02:24:05.980]   and of course you can subscribe
[02:24:05.980 --> 02:24:07.740]   and your favorite podcast player
[02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:10.540]   and get it automatically the minute it's available.
[02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:13.980]   Make sure you leave us a five star review.
[02:24:13.980 --> 02:24:16.140]   Is this the governor?
[02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:18.780]   Is this the governor holding a favorite pet?
[02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:21.140]   - Oh no, that's Senator Tom Tillis.
[02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:23.780]   It was because of the Madison Cawthorn stuff
[02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:26.340]   and how Tillis kind of like helped that not,
[02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:27.340]   you know, helped that.
[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:30.180]   - He's saying instead of cocaine and orgies,
[02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:31.820]   he's got a nice puppy instead.
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:32.660]   Make it.
[02:24:32.660 --> 02:24:33.500]   - Oh my gosh.
[02:24:33.500 --> 02:24:34.500]   So I, when I,
[02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:37.660]   - By the way, you won, you won.
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:41.100]   Tillis did not like a Cawthorn D.
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:44.100]   - No, it was the orgie stuff I think.
[02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:45.940]   - That's really what I'm gonna put him over the top.
[02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:46.780]   Yeah.
[02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:47.620]   - Wow.
[02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:49.180]   - But that dog is the cutest dog.
[02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:52.100]   I actually visited the office and walked into the office
[02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:55.780]   behind Tillis and was like, where's the dog?
[02:24:55.780 --> 02:24:58.260]   And then I got, it's a really sweet dog.
[02:24:58.260 --> 02:24:59.300]   Her name is Tilly.
[02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:01.620]   - Is she the official mascot of his office,
[02:25:01.620 --> 02:25:02.900]   the Senate office?
[02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:05.820]   - Yeah, it's his digital director's dog.
[02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:07.540]   She now lives back in the state,
[02:25:07.540 --> 02:25:09.540]   but her dog still has an Instagram
[02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:10.740]   that's really worth following.
[02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:13.300]   - Shoot, what's the Instagram?
[02:25:13.300 --> 02:25:14.700]   - Oh, let me check.
[02:25:14.700 --> 02:25:15.900]   - I could probably find the tweet
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:17.740]   and then I'd be able to,
[02:25:17.740 --> 02:25:18.580]   I'm sure it's in your tweet.
[02:25:18.580 --> 02:25:20.180]   - Yeah, I was just messaging.
[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:24.220]   It's, let's see.
[02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:27.620]   So Senator Tillis, a little relieved?
[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:28.740]   - I'm sure.
[02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:31.660]   Oh, the handle is teeny, tiny, Tilly.
[02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:33.260]   - I love it.
[02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:34.180]   - It's really cute.
[02:25:34.180 --> 02:25:36.180]   It's a really, really cute dog.
[02:25:36.180 --> 02:25:39.580]   Yeah, I like anything with a squishy thing.
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:41.540]   - This is the kind of stuff we need
[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:45.020]   to go across the aisle to make a difference.
[02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:47.180]   No, this is the wrong teeny, tiny, Tilly.
[02:25:47.180 --> 02:25:50.700]   Apparently they're more than one teeny, tiny, Tilly.
[02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:55.080]   - Yeah, it's teeny, T-E-N-I-E, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny,
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:55.980]   sorry, sorry.
[02:25:55.980 --> 02:25:59.780]   - Very important that you spell teeny properly.
[02:25:59.780 --> 02:26:00.700]   There we go.
[02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:01.540]   - We need a reader.
[02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:02.460]   - I got her, I got her.
[02:26:02.460 --> 02:26:04.380]   Here she is, that's her.
[02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:05.220]   - She's really cute.
[02:26:05.220 --> 02:26:06.260]   - Is that a French bulldog?
[02:26:06.260 --> 02:26:07.820]   What is that?
[02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:08.660]   - Boston Terrier.
[02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:09.660]   - Boston Terrier.
[02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:12.180]   Love them.
[02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:13.380]   So cute.
[02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:16.380]   So she wasn't a puppy, that was full grown.
[02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:17.220]   That's how big.
[02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:18.500]   - Oh no, that was when she was a puppy.
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:19.340]   - She wasn't a puppy, okay.
[02:26:19.340 --> 02:26:21.060]   She fit literally in the palm of your hand.
[02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:23.020]   Like, Tilly's is a tall guy, big hands,
[02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:26.740]   but like, she's still really, really tiny.
[02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:29.740]   There's some really good no dogs, right?
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:32.620]   - Really, you should do a book, The Hill Dogs.
[02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:34.100]   That'd be good.
[02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:36.860]   - Fun fact, our street has a newsletter
[02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:40.900]   that highlights dogs around DC and in politics
[02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:44.020]   every, every other week and it's called Bark Street.
[02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:47.380]   - Oh my God, so you see?
[02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:49.020]   - I keep on trying to push Padre.
[02:26:49.020 --> 02:26:49.860]   - Oh, look at that.
[02:26:49.860 --> 02:26:51.940]   - We have children's books for the vat of cats.
[02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:55.100]   - See, I actually spelled bark in barks.
[02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:56.260]   The capital R.
[02:26:56.260 --> 02:26:57.260]   - Bark.
[02:26:57.260 --> 02:26:58.100]   - Yeah.
[02:26:58.100 --> 02:26:58.940]   - Bark.
[02:26:58.940 --> 02:27:00.020]   - That's all I'm bringing.
[02:27:00.020 --> 02:27:01.420]   - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:02.260]   It's really cute.
[02:27:02.260 --> 02:27:05.780]   We've highlighted Tilly, Susan Collins' dog.
[02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:08.700]   We've had dogs all over the spectrum.
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:09.780]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:13.180]   - There's the by Pawtas and Halloween party.
[02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:15.300]   (laughing)
[02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:18.100]   - I go to The Hill to visit dogs
[02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:19.900]   like more than you might think I would
[02:27:19.900 --> 02:27:21.260]   as like a grown woman.
[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:22.900]   (laughing)
[02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:25.460]   - Really Tilly owns this newsletter, I think.
[02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:26.300]   - Right.
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:28.140]   - Oh, there's Hannah, oh good, okay.
[02:27:28.140 --> 02:27:30.300]   - Oh yeah, we have an adoptable dog every week.
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:31.140]   - Oh.
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:33.540]   - Right.
[02:27:33.540 --> 02:27:35.940]   - Do you have a dog yourself, Shoshana?
[02:27:35.940 --> 02:27:38.700]   - No, so I grew up with him and my parents
[02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:40.580]   have a dog that I'm still pretty close with,
[02:27:40.580 --> 02:27:43.260]   but the trouble is I go hiking a lot
[02:27:43.260 --> 02:27:45.020]   and I really want a pug.
[02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:47.500]   So one, I want to breed pugs at altitude
[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:49.500]   so they will be born altitude adjusted
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:52.140]   and the breathing problems for hiking will be left.
[02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:52.980]   - Yeah.
[02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:54.980]   - And I'm gonna name it, Pug Doocy.
[02:27:54.980 --> 02:27:57.260]   (laughing)
[02:27:57.260 --> 02:27:59.980]   - And on that note, we thank you all for joining us.
[02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:01.220]   (laughing)
[02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:03.300]   On this week in Google, thank you Shoshana.
[02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:05.140]   Take care, bye bye everybody.
[02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:06.140]   - Hey.
[02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:08.620]   - Hey, I'm Rod Pile, editor of Ad Astor Magazine.
[02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:10.700]   And each week I'm joined by Tariq Malek,
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:13.460]   the editor-in-chief over at space.com.
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:15.500]   In our new This Week in Space podcast,
[02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:17.740]   every Friday, Tariq and I take a deep dive
[02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:19.900]   into the stories that define the new space age.
[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:21.100]   What's NASA up to?
[02:28:21.100 --> 02:28:23.780]   When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?
[02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:25.860]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance rover?
[02:28:25.860 --> 02:28:27.300]   When are those coming home?
[02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:29.580]   What the heck is Elon Musk done now?
[02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:31.260]   In addition to all the latest and greatest
[02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:33.900]   in space exploration, we'll take an occasional look
[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:35.260]   at bits of space flight history
[02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:37.020]   that you probably never heard of
