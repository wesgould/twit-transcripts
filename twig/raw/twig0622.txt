[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Hello Twig and Bottoms! It's time for Twig actually stays. He's not here. Jason Howell joins Kevin Marks and Aunt Pruitt.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Jeff's also got the week off, but we have a lot to talk about. Big, big earnings for Alphabet.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   YouTube doing well too. We'll talk about the Pixel 6 as long as we've got Jason here.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And you'll be amazed at what he can do with all the dessert names. He's going to name them alphabetically.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Coming up next. On Twig.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   From people you trust. This is Twig.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   This is Twig. This week in Google, Episode 622, recorded Wednesday, July 28, 2021.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Rocket to Hawaii.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   This week in Google is brought to you by Wealthfront. To get your first $5,000 managed for free for life, go to wealthfront.com/twig and start growing your savings today.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   It's time for Twig. This week in Glutes. I mean, Google.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   We will not be even speaking about Glutes today on the show.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   No, we already have. We got it out of our system earlier.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   This is a little bit of an odd situation. Jeff Jarvis is on the road.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And then Stacey called in sick. And so Jason Howell has very kindly considered to fill in.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Hello. Nice to have you. Host of all about Android. Of course, the show's producer.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Aunt Prude is here. Thank goodness. And his Clem's in orange. Good to see you.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Hello, sir. Nice to have you here.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And joining us from Yorkshire in the UK. Kevin Marks, our favorite Yorkshireman.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   You don't sound like a Yorkshireman.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Yeah, I wouldn't claim to be Yorkshireman especially in pubs here.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   But there he is on the Moors. Adopted Yorkshireman.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Yeah, adopted. That's perfect. That's perfect.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   You must be happy to see your former company, Alphabet, aka Google.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Nate Google is crushing. The Q2 earnings are out and they beat the estimates soundly.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Which, of course, is stock market responded by selling them off.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So I don't understand anything about the stock market.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Revenues of $61.9 billion in the quarter ending June 30.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   A net income of $18.5 billion at $6 billion a month.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   One and a half billion dollars a week. That is a lot of money a day.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I'm not going to do the math. It's very, very successful.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That's unbelievable. Yeah. Top line growth of 62% net income expansion.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Get this of 166%. Now, part of that is because Q2 last year.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   It was not very good when COVID first hit.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   But did Google do particularly bad when all that happened?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I don't think so. I know they didn't.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So it's easy to point to that. But they were totally fine last year.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   A lot of people were out of work and lost a lot of money last year.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   But big tech and a lot of these people indeed stock market.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   They were just fine. Yeah.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Wow. Look at that. Initially, shares went up just a tad.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   But today they've declined pretty precipitously.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It's just, I don't know what this stock market has to do with anything.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   That's always been my contention. It's some sort of strange machine.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   YouTube revenue $7 billion. That's up 84% year over year.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   By the way, digital advertising was a big winner across the board.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Both Facebook and Google. Really, really huge growth in digital advertising.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   The point where I think the television networks have got to be
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   start being a little bit nervous about this.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I think the YouTube revenue being so high, it makes a lot of sense from Q2
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   and up from last year to now with a lot of people going whole hog
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   on doing their own content and putting more into their current YouTube channel
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   just to grow it because they felt like, "You know what? I'm here.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I'm home. I have control over this and I can make a go of it."
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And I'm not just saying just regular small creators or whatever,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   but brands are saying, "You know what? Let's put more into it as well."
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Digital advertising. Let me see if I can find the increase in Google.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   It was a big increase and it's credited with the success that Google had in this quarter.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   The financial officer, the famous Ruth Porret, or I almost said infamous Ruth Porret,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   said, "Our strong second quarter revenues reflect elevated consumer
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   online activity and broad based strength in advertiser spend."
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Of course, I think that spend was down last year ago because of COVID.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Google is benefiting Cornet Sundar Pichai from a rising tide of consumer
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   and enterprise demand. And speaking of enterprise,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Google Cloud had revenue of 4.6 billion, up 54% year over year.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   That's a little bit more actually than Microsoft for Azure.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And Microsoft had an excellent year for Azure.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   On other bets?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Well, this is where things go the other direction.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   But are they ever positive in the other?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   There are always losers there.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   It's really how much, how wide is that?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It's always supported by the search and ad sale.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Searching ads.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   They're core business.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   They did amazing.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   The other stuff that they're used to losing on.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   So revenue on other bets, up, losses, up.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Alphabet, Skunk Works posted 192 million in revenue up from 148 million,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   but the losses mounted as well, 1.4 billion.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Okay, so let me just put that in perspective.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   They revenue is 192 million.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   They lost 1.4 billion.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   That's a lot more if my math is right.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I think that math works out.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And that's up from 1.1 billion year ago.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Other bets is all the other stuff.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Right?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Android, I'm sure, had a good quarter.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   They don't break that out.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Android and Chrome or something like that.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   It is things that are supposed to be speculative.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   It's verily and...
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Yeah, just the hardware.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Does the hardware division fall into other bets?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   They're pixel line.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Probably not.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   That's a more line of business thing.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Yeah, I would hope so.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Other bets is the thing Google kills.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Like Loon.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Right.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Project Loon.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Certainly, they're all experimental things.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Access, Calico.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   What is Calico?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Google Adventures.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Their venture arm is considered other bets.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Nest is.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Waymo is obviously their self-driving thing.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Google X.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I'm surprised.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Google Ventures, Google Capital.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Is that other bets now?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   No, that's closed.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Oh, now that's closed probably not.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Is it gone?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Is GV gone?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   No, no, no.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   No, I mean, Fitbit's been...
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   The acquisition is...
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Oh, Fitbit?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Oh, you talk about Fitbit?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Right.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Well, the payment to that will have counted as another bet.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I see.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Okay, that makes sense.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I think so.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So the things like Calico, Verily, Waymo, and the X projects, those make sense as kind of
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   like very highly speculative warranty.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And then the other losses come from investments that haven't yet paid off.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I'm surprised Nest is in other bets.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I believe now it's actually out of a bet.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Yeah, I think...
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Yeah, this is all here.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Last February.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Okay.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   McConaughey, Jigsaw, Chronicle, and Nest.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Jigsaw.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Lost their other bet status.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Is Waymo considered other bets because there's no Waymo car for...
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   There's no Waymo money given.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Man.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I didn't mean to make that a pun.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Is Waymo money losing?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Waymo's been a little bit of a disappointment.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Remember, they brought in a big shot and they said they were going to buy hundreds of dollars.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   They were trying.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I give them credit.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   They were trying.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Is it just harder to do than they thought it was?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Maybe, but Tesla seems to be fine with its initiatives.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   GM's Cruise is starting to drive around San Francisco, although I have to say, if you ever see one of these, do you like avoid them?
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Like if you see one of the self-driving vehicles, you're like, "I just told them."
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I never think to.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   If I ever see them, I usually just sort of stop what I'm doing in this marvel at it because it's interesting tech.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Well, wasn't that...
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I probably should run.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Wasn't that what happened when the bus hit a bus or something?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Yeah, but that was good news, according to Google.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   No, the engineers said, "Well, that was a tricky situation because if the bus had been merely a passenger vehicle,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   the Waymo made an assumption that it would slow down for it as it re-entered traffic because it was stopped by the construction sign,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   and so it had to re-enter traffic."
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   And the engineers said, "Now we know if a bus is coming, don't assume they're going to give way."
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And so we've learned something.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It was a minor fenderbender. It wasn't like a horrific thing.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   But I thought it was more that the buses were used to the Google...
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It was going out of their way and they changed the code so it didn't...
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And it's unfortunate.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Yes, they updated the code.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   It's unfortunate that their unit testing involved a fenderbender, though.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Is there a lot of way for them to do that?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   It was...
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   The Tesla's ones have done. I think it's not true.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Yeah, you don't want a person to flake.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   There were three of them decapitate people.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Those things are...
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   You know, not...
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Crashing to the divider 185.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Yeah, well, that was sad, actually.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So they hired a guy named John Craftchick, who was very well known in the industry, and he quit.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Because Waymo just wasn't, I think, reading between the lines, moving as fast as they had been planning to move.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   He joined the company.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Okay.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Well, we had the stats. I had a story.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Screw it.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   The car hit the bus in 2016.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   18 miles an hour, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   The flashbacks.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   That's still pretty fast.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   That's still pretty fast.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Craftchick came from Hyundai Motors, and they really wanted to...
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   They want to make still, I think, Waymo be a taxi system, basically.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And you can take Waymo's...
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   There's a guy posted on YouTube all the time with his Waymo rides in Arizona, Phoenix.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Yeah, I've got it in San Francisco and a few other areas, but...
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Yeah, we don't see him here.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Oh, definitely don't see him in Petal.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   I knew this horn. I've always saw Waymo cars at CES downtown.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Vegas U-BET.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   All right.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Anyway, a good quarter.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   A quarter to be proud of for alphabet.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Dollar, dollar bills.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   What is...
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   So, Jason, you're the all about Android guy.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Sure.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Sometimes.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   When I'm not off for two seconds.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   When you're there...
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I think Android and the pixels...
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I mean, I guess they don't make money on the Pixel phones.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   It really doesn't seem like Google's raking in the dough when it comes to their Pixel hardware.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Yeah, we had this conversation not too long ago on the show.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   I can't remember if it was T&W or all about Android.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Just trying to really understand, like, does Google care that their hardware division is...
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I mean, it has its enthusiast fan base.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   I would consider myself kind of in that camp.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I'm always looking forward to a new Pixel phone, and it's the phone that I tend to be drawn towards.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Right.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   But has no real pull from a wide perspective when compared to a lot of the other manufacturers out there.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Does Google really care that much about that aspect?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Or are they more sold on the fact that they're creating an open platform that they want all competitors to participate in?
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Yeah, the Pixel...
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   We always thought was a reference design as opposed to a business.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   You know, versus the Apple approach, which the Apple approach is very...
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   You know, everything is just as important as everything else, and it all works together and everything.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Google, it really doesn't feel like they care about that same kind of equity of their products when it comes to their Pixel hardware.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Again, because...
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   So if it loses money, like, is that really the end of the world?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Is that what Google even expected to begin with?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   You know, that the Pixel was going to light the world up for.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   For a company that their business is data, you would think they would put more effort into a piece of hardware
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   that can get more data like right now, you know?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Well, but does the data that comes off of their own hardware matter more than the data that comes from all of the Android hardware?
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   That's running Google software?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   No, I would say no.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Like, they get just as valuable information, if not more valuable, because they just provided the platform.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Everybody else is doing all the expensive, you know, difficult work you say in the world.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Thank you, Sam.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Exactly.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Exactly.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And they still benefit from it just this way.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   I'm Robert Pichai.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   I did talk about it in the analyst call today.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   He said that Google Pixel event is expected to happen sometime in the fall.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Thanks for the revelation.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   As it does in reuse right there.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   October, usually, right?
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Right after the advent.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Yep.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   He also said...
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   He talked about Android 12, the personalization features, which are really the big new features in Android 12.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Yes.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   The new privacy features.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I'll talk about that in the change log.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   They actually have kind of attempted to reach parity with what Apple's doing with their privacy features with the app store.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And then transitioned into the fall hardware event where he said, "Google will showcase Android 12 and deep technology investments."
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Yes.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   That's probably Whitechapel.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Whitechapel.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   That's the new chip for the Pixel 6.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   The Google, the in-house kind of chip, Google taking more of the SOC into their own hands.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Good.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Were they making that weird?
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Off the top of my head, I can't recall.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I have fuzzy brain.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   It's not just them.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   I can't remember if it's Samsung and Google or who it is, but they are making it in conjunction with somebody else.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   It's 5 nanometer.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Actually, it wouldn't be surprising if it's Samsung.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Its arm, obviously, has the Malay graphics engine in it.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It's like an Exynos kind of...
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Yes.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   That's right.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Which further illustrates just how cozy Google has become with Samsung in recent months.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   We also have WearOS 3, which Samsung is going to have their event next month, the impact event.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And that's going to be kind of the efficient.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They have kind of made up.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   They said big time.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Yeah, ties in.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   We're going to merge that with Wear.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Yeah, they kind of have kistemate up.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   They should.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   For a long time, Samsung would not even say the A word in all of this.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I still don't know if they do or if they will.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   But, you know, that's true.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   They really have not mentioned the word of Android.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   I'm excited about the Pixel 6.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   The rumors are, besides this new chip, the white chapel chip, it's going to have a new camera system, which they did not do in the Pixel 5, which was really a disappointment.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   It's why I didn't buy a Pixel 5, I thought.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Makes no sense.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   I already have that chip.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I have the Pixel X4.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Yep.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   I think I'm probably not alone in that.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   I mean, you know, Google has rested on its laurels as far as its camera system has been concerned.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   It's been a very dependable camera system in the Pixel devices year after year.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   But it's been the same one from the beginning when they first put out the, I think it was the Pixel 2 that had the amazing camera.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   And it's the same camera ever since.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   And so, you know, everybody else is throwing a lot more into their camera systems.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   It's time for Google to step up.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   It's past time, actually, for Google.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Yeah, but they were putting more effort into their AI though.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Yeah, that's off the line.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   And that AI definitely works wonders for those phones.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   There's a lot of times you take a shot with a Pixel phone and you can tell, oh, a Pixel shot this, not just some other...
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Totally, totally agree.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   ...you know.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   The AI just gets it right.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Yep.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Absolutely.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Google actually is attempting to fix its cloud product.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Here's an article from Ronamario in the...
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Hey, Ron.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   ...mystetrical.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Technicolon call.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Technicolon.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Not a friend of our Android product.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   R's...
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Chachoke.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   R's Technicolon.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Google Cloud offers a model for fixing Google's product killing reputation.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   They've announced that they're going to go a minimum of one year...
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   give a minimum of one year to notice if they have to change the API in cloud.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Of course, this comes from the history of Google saying, you know...
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Oh, that new thing you like so much?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Yeah, we're not going to...
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Not so much.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   It's a good API deprecations.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   It's more like product stuff that they blow up.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   True.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Google says, "To make sure we follow those tenets, the one year API...
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.500]   Any change we introduced to an API is reviewed by a centralized board of product and engineering
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.000]   leads and follows a rigorous product lifecycle evaluation."
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Yeah, you don't want to put your eggs in an infrastructure basket that's going to change...
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   I'll just go through it too quickly.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Protocol reports that Google Vice President Kripa Krishnan was asked during the announcement,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   if she's familiar with the "killed by Google" website...
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Good question.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Of course they are.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Protocol says, "Krishnan couldn't help but laugh."
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   And she said, "Well, it's pretty apparent to us from many sources on the Internet that
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   we were not doing well."
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   So they're aware of it.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Good.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   You're right, though, Kevin, saying, "Oh, we're not going to deprecate an API for a whole year."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   This is exactly a...
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   It's still not great if you're actually relying on it.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   A round trip, or a new way of doing things.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Well, and it's nothing new.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   I mean, from either from the developer side of things or from the consumer side of things.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   At this point, if you follow Google and you have any sort of affinity to Google's products,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   whatsoever in the last however many years, you've probably had a lot of money.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.080]   You've probably had at least one situation, but likely more, where a product that you once
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:55.800]   thought Google was truly sold on suddenly goes away or is suddenly announced to be dead.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.000]   And at this point, it's a meme in and of itself.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.040]   Like anytime there is a new product coming from Google, a major product, for anyone to
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.400]   get excited about, it's always dampened with the wet blanket of, "Well, that is as long
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.000]   as Google cares about it and doesn't kill it."
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Everybody starts their little sin.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   The sin, the sin, the blood.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   The sand can't down.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   The hourglass timer.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   The hourglass timer.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   That's an upside down.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   How long is this going to last?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Here we go.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   You know, and so it's a meme and people get worked up about it and like, "Oh yeah, you
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   don't need to worry about that."
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   But we actually do because there are many examples of it.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   At this point, it's hard to trust Google when it says it cares about something.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Because it very quickly does not.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.600]   But Google isn't the only company to not care about its products and to find out that it
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.080]   needs to move on from things.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.600]   So why does Google take the heat on this?
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:51.720]   I would assume Google is more prolific with announcing, well at least at one point in
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.240]   time, they were announcing different apps and services pretty regularly.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.040]   I didn't hear about Twitter announcing fleets and announcing this and announcing that.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.520]   I just heard them announcing fleets and then killing it.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.520]   And then killing it.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.520]   You know.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.840]   But I mean, but Google, it was Alo and then it was Chats and then it was Fingouts and it's
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.400]   not Chats and then it was Voice and then it was, you know, they pretty prolific with
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.160]   the things that they release.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:20.800]   But again, that goes back to my theory of they have pretty craptastic product management
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.240]   where it's just everything is so scatterbrained and all over the place and I think someone
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:31.080]   in a higher up needs to get everybody a little bit more focus or you don't have to have these
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.800]   meetings of, "Okay, we need to go ahead and kill this app."
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.920]   And replace it with some of the features, take some of the best features and put it over
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.760]   here, but not for a couple of years.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.760]   So, you know.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.360]   That's just driving me insane.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   No, it is.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.720]   I mean, I think part of it is Google, by design, was supposed to make it easier to launch things
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.760]   because they're worried about startups competing with them.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.360]   But that also meant that then they would kill them when they die.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.920]   You don't care so much when some startup fails and dies, but Google's true.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.120]   By default gets millions of users on day one.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.120]   So, yeah.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.360]   Yeah, and the messaging thing is just been chaos forever.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:12.040]   Well, I get the sense this was kind of Larry Page and in the early days, and maybe Eric
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.560]   Schmidt had something to do with it, but I get the feeling it was more of Sergey and
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.800]   Larry's idea of, "We don't want to be a big company.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.680]   We want to be a collection of nimble, fast-moving startups."
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.680]   Right?
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.480]   At a certain point those startups need to talk to each other.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.480]   Well, but now they all are the same.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.960]   But now that Larry and Sergey and Eric are gone, maybe it's time to start to...
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.960]   It's hard.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960]   I understand.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   It's hard.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   You don't want to become hidebound.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.520]   You don't want to be a big corporation where...
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.560]   I know, Kevin, you've worked for big, big companies where things move like molasses.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.560]   That's true.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:53.600]   And nothing gets done because of fear and caution and you want to be nimble.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.680]   But that's the risk that then you make a lot of products that don't make it.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.400]   I'm sure Google is not the only people guilty of this, but these departments are so siloed
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.200]   and they never ever talked to one another.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.960]   Again, I think that was intentional.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.960]   I think they really wanted...
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   Well, it's not just...
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.960]   I just didn't talk to each other.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.920]   It's more that the culture was, "We'll have lots of products."
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:20.360]   Whereas Apple does try lots of things out, but they tend to do it before they launch it.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.160]   And partly that's the sort of historic thing that's happening.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.360]   And in private, by the way.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.360]   Yeah, that is.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:30.680]   There are a lot of regular people assume that Google is putting products out for the consumer
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.480]   to beta test it instead of doing their own beta testing.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.920]   But they will dog feed it first and they'll drive stuff out internally and then they'll
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.560]   push something out to consumers.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.200]   But there's definitely more chaos involved.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   And it's partly because web things are easier to sort of launch and kill.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.280]   There's not as much ramparts when you're doing hardware.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.280]   It's just soft.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.560]   Apple culture is very much.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.080]   We're launching hardware.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.280]   We're doing one big release a year.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.600]   And you can decide which thing is going to that release.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.440]   And that becomes the...
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.280]   So the next iOS version, we'll have a bunch of stuff in it and then we'll deprate a bunch
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.800]   of stuff and we'll miss some of it.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.960]   But it'll most be talking about the hardware features.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.880]   And we won't necessarily notice that...
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.360]   I'm not sure what they're going to kill this time.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.960]   But some stuff comes and goes up there as well.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.960]   Sure.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.200]   It's interesting because in a way, Google's becoming more of a hardware company with the
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.440]   acquisition of Nest and Fitbit and the Pixel.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.360]   And Apple's becoming more of a software company.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:32.240]   They've seen that the future for Apple, once they saturate the iPhone market, is services.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.760]   So both companies want to do both.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.160]   This actually segues into an article that this is a little more philosophical, but I
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.560]   thought it would be very interesting to talk about.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.600]   I don't know if you've been following the news out of China, but it started with Jack
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:54.760]   Ma and Ant, the Alibaba, Rich's guy in China, China slapped him down.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:03.080]   At one point he disappeared and really they've canceled the IPO, they've dismantled the
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.080]   financial.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.640]   Now they're going after DD, which is the Uber of China, and Tencent, which is China's
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.640]   biggest social media company.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.120]   I read a really good think piece from a guy named Noah Smith.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.400]   I love the name of his blog, Noah Pinyon.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:29.160]   But he says, if you look at what China's shutting down, what China's clamping down on,
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:34.600]   it may mean not so much that they want to clamp down on dissent or they want to control
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.600]   more tightly the social media.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.880]   What they're really trying to close down on is the companies that aren't really creating
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.240]   a lot of value, they're doing almost a lot of rent taking in the ecosystem.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:54.440]   Companies, software companies, companies like DD and Tencent, which are hugely successful.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:01.280]   Alibaba, which is like the Amazon of China, they're hugely successful, but not by adding
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.520]   value to the economy as much as a company like, let's say Intel or Apple or Microsoft
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:16.760]   ads, and he points out that in fact the big Chinese hardware companies are not facing
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.800]   this kind of scrutiny.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   They're not being shut down or investigated.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:31.840]   He says maybe this is China reorienting because they don't need to do it through a democratic
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.840]   process.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.680]   But reordering by fiat, they're economic priorities.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.960]   They're shifting.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.120]   He says after the Cold War, our priorities in the US shifted from survival to enjoyment
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:49.600]   technologies like Facebook and Amazon, which are fundamentally about leisure and consumption.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:56.000]   In the early days, technology was about R&D, it was about winning wars, pre-war war II.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Defense spending has traditionally been a huge component of government research spending
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.240]   in the US.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.600]   Many of America's most successful private sector tech industries, he writes, are in some
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.920]   way spin-offs of these defense related industries.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.880]   But then post-war, it became about fun entertainment.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.360]   He says China never really shifted out of survival mode.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:20.400]   They embraced economic growth, but what they really want is comprehensive national power
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.920]   and soft power globally, economic power.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.920]   Chinese young people know our rights, maybe increasingly ready to cash out and have some
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.760]   fun, but leadership is just not there yet.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.080]   So when China's leaders look at what kind of technologies they want the countries, engineers,
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.680]   and entrepreneurs to be spending their efforts on, they probably don't want them spending
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.920]   effort on stuff that's just for fun and convenience.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.240]   They probably took a look at their consumer internet sector, decided the link between
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.720]   that sector and geopolitical power is too tenuous to keep throwing capital and high-skilled
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.480]   labor at it.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.280]   And so in classic CCP fashion, it was time to smash.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.680]   I thought that was a very interesting take on that.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:07.400]   And maybe because China's handling their big tech by fiat, just like, "Okay, you're out,
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.760]   you're gone."
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.280]   We obviously have to go through a much more prolonged process, but there's also in the
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:19.800]   US this kind of anger at big tech, maybe we should think about what we're angry about
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.960]   and think about the companies that are adding real value, not just to social and not just
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.480]   to geopolitical power, but to the economy.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:33.840]   Well, I mean, part of it is that we've been very financialized here.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.960]   So if you look at the recent investment bubbles, they have not been tech-centric, they've been
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   financial-centric.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   Right.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.760]   And I include blockchain stuff and things like that in that.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.360]   But also, there's a very...
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.800]   There wasn't a...
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.320]   We've been looking for the "what's the next thing" for a five-year period or so and haven't
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.120]   really settled on it yet.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.320]   We don't know what's passed phones.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:06.720]   That was the last big hardware-driven change.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:13.480]   And there's been a lot of, as you say, social tech, froth and then other kinds of very financialized
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   froth.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:20.840]   And a lot of the investment models in the US have been these effectively, "Let's lose
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.640]   money to try and get monopoly companies like Uber."
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:31.880]   And we work and Airbnb and so on.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.960]   And China has had examples of those.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:40.800]   They had the huge bicycle boom and bust there.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.800]   Which was...
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:46.000]   We've had bicycle rental things here, but in China, they were like six competing bicycle
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.560]   rental companies.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.840]   And they're still in huge...
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.760]   You can see photographs of them, huge landfills full of abandoned electrical bicycles because
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.400]   they were trying to do the...
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.560]   We'll make the money from the day to gathering and not from the bicycle.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.560]   And that's...
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.040]   So there's that stuff.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.520]   And again, also, they've pushed out all the Bitcoin mining in the last three months or
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.520]   so.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.520]   Because...
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.520]   Similar.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.520]   We direct stuff.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.520]   Yes.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.960]   So they're basically saying, "We're not sure about these financially fluffy things.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.920]   Let's look at things that are actually productive."
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.720]   They're also reducing apparently venture funding.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.520]   They're trying to squash that bubble.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.520]   And they're also investing a lot in...
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:31.680]   They've been investing in infrastructure, not just in China, which has been very visible,
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.920]   but also in other countries around the world for supply chain work.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.640]   The Belt and Road Initiative, yeah.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   So there's...
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:41.880]   Yeah, so there's definitely a sense they're looking at it differently and possibly drawing
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.200]   back from the sort of financialization.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.200]   And the companies you're talking about, they're sort of backing off from are the ones that
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   are closest to those bottles, I think.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.280]   They're frotheist.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.560]   They support Huawei still doing strong.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.880]   The government is, according to NOAA, hell-bent for leather to create a world-class domestic
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.560]   semiconductor industry, spending heavily on AI.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.280]   We know that.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.840]   So it's not technology China's smashing.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.480]   It's the consumer-facing software companies they're going after.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:17.600]   And if you put it in that light, that's kind of an interesting strategy.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:24.000]   And I wonder, certainly our hardware Intel did very well, AMD did very well.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.160]   Qualcomm is very successful.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.320]   I haven't seen their quarterly results yet.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:33.200]   Microsoft and Google, I think you could say, are mostly on the side of creating hard tech
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:38.800]   value as opposed to something like Facebook or Amazon or Twitter.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.920]   Those companies are doing well in this country, but I wonder if in our scrutiny of big tech,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.960]   we're not thinking as strategically as the Chinese Communist Party is thinking.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:55.200]   Tech aside on this, but I'm seeing if I can say this without getting in trouble.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.800]   When I see articles like this, I always think about the notion of people think Americans
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.720]   are just so horrible and spoiled.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:10.480]   And then you look at places like China where they're just worried about bottom line kind
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.480]   of things.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   They're allowed to be harmful.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.160]   It's just bottom line kind of things.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.920]   We're over here just sort of now.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:23.360]   They're plenty of harmful and spoiled Chinese millionaires and billionaires now.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.520]   But it's interesting that China, you know, Jack Ma was kind of the poster boy for that.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.280]   And China crack has been cracking down on it, which I think is kind of interesting.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.560]   And maybe that's because they don't want to, you know, I think Americans, they wanted
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.560]   to.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.560]   They wanted that growth.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.840]   They wanted that startup economy, but then looked at the consequences of it and maybe
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.640]   thought maybe we should redirect it.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:48.080]   But it looks like they haven't been scared of infrastructure investment, the amount of
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:55.520]   high speed trains and that's something I really regret that we are not doing here.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.520]   Right.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.720]   You know, we'd rather put it into let's launch into space.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.720]   That's the big thing.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   And I'll give you a round.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:11.960]   I believe I mentioned last week, even though the media pretty much pooped on Bezos and
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.840]   Branson for their efforts to go to the edge of space, there's still some plenty of research
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:22.760]   that can come from what they did that may eventually end up helping out the regular consumer
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   with travel, not to edge of space, but just from this side of the country to the other
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   side of the country.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.520]   You went to Hawaii for your vacation.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.520]   He asked me.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:38.640]   No scientific benefits that I can guarantee.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.760]   I know that I can't digest Spam Masubi before getting on an airplane.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.760]   So other than that.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:48.720]   But I mean just, but you asked, had I been to Hawaii and I had to tell you no, because
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.080]   it was a long way different than you used.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.080]   East Coast.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.600]   East Coasters go to the Caribbean, they go to the Bahamas, they go to Florida.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   Right.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.200]   Even though I would love to go to Hawaii, but I thought about that a little bit more.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:04.000]   What if there's a way for it to be a much faster trip that's economical for folks on
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.480]   the East Coast to be able to see?
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.720]   Would you ride a rocket to Hawaii?
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.760]   To Hawaii, but not to space.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.800]   Well, I guess it would kind of, you'd kind of cross the common line.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   It'd be a parabola.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   That was, that's the plan, right?
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   I don't know.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   Is it Blue Origin that wants to do that?
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   I can't remember.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   Right.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   It'd be a parabola.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.640]   And so they're talking about New York to Shanghai in a matter of an hour or two.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.640]   And I think that's good.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.640]   You know, and if we can--
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.640]   Is it Elon?
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.640]   Elon wants to do that.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.000]   And if we can get costs down for regular consumers to be able to do that in the next
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.800]   20 years or so, I think that's, I think them doing this right now is good for the future.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.560]   But again, humans are involved and humans are greedy and going to do some really greedy
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.200]   things and we may not even see anything out of this.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.120]   New York to Shanghai in 40 minutes, I'm sorry.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.120]   That would be even--
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.120]   Wow.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.200]   Even better.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:59.000]   And that's Elon Musk that wants to do that with SpaceX.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   I mean, he said it would cost about the same as a first class ticket to--
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.680]   And first class tickets are in their quotes.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.680]   It's expensive.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.680]   Yeah, very expensive.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:14.040]   But at the same time, paying for an air--
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.400]   It seems to be a first class ticket to go to the other side of the planet.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.400]   That's pretty bad guy.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   Pretty amazing.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400]   Comical.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.560]   All right.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.080]   Let's take a break.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   Come back.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.080]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   It's nice to have you.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.080]   Kevin Marks.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.720]   Are you doing the Indie Web thing still, yes?
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.600]   Yes, still doing Indie Web stuff.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:39.200]   There's an Indie Web meetup a bit later on today.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   It's 60--
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.040]   They're all virtual still though, yeah?
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.040]   Actually, it's in the end.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.040]   It's a good time, I think.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.240]   But yeah, it's still virtual.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.520]   If you go to indyweb.org, you can see where the next meetings are.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:57.920]   1800, the Nuremberg website meeting tonight.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.000]   And there's also one in the Americas.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   But the beauty of this is--
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.520]   Yeah, 6 p.m. West Coast time doesn't matter because it's via--
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   Do you zoom?
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.520]   What do you use?
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.520]   We use Jizzi.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.520]   Not Jizzi.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.720]   We tried Jizzi and we ended up using zoom because it was a bit more reliable.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.760]   We tried to actually think, yeah, I know that story.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.920]   I just shut down like Jizzi server.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.080]   I like Jizzi.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.880]   I could never get anybody to use it.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.280]   I created a Twitch.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.840]   I don't remember when you created it.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.480]   I could never get anybody to use it.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.080]   So we are using zoom now.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.720]   Are you on zoom, Kevin?
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.720]   I'm on zoom at the minute, yeah.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.720]   We got you to use zoom too.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.720]   He looks good.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.720]   Yeah, that's not too bad.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   I mean, I have used Skype with you before, but I'm not sure I've got Skype anymore.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.720]   Like Skype.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   I don't even think Microsoft has Skype.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.720]   They've got teams and Skype for business and I'm never quite sure what's going on.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.720]   Yeah, well, we've been talking about that on Windows Weekly.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.720]   Hello, dozers!
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:04.800]   And it's pretty much they're going to phase out Skype in favor of teams.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   Everybody seems to agree.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.880]   I think even Microsoft has said that.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:12.440]   We've been talking about Gelline a couple of times on Floss Weekly here the last couple
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.800]   weeks is another video kind.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   I don't know that one.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:19.800]   G-I-L-E-A-N-G-A-L-E-N-E dot org.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   Gelline.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.960]   That's from Mr. David Tatt.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.960]   Dave Tatt.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.960]   Oh.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.200]   Like a Bailine whale, but it's a Gailine whale dot org.com.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:34.040]   But this open source video conference in and Mr. Sir got in using it.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.040]   It's French.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.040]   Oh, that's them.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.640]   We know how my French accent says.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.160]   Oh, it's implemented in Go.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.160]   Okay.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.760]   WebRTC uses the Pion.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.320]   I don't know what that is implementation of WebRTC.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.320]   Interesting.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.600]   The server says it's legit.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   He's a bit of a new user.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.800]   Is that WebRTC was supposed to mean that we could do this in browsers and just in -- right.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.720]   But everyone is wrapping it in their own thing as well.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.200]   So it seems like a bit of a shame.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.200]   Gelline is one.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:06.240]   Janice, ION, SFU, and Jitsi, of course, all use WebRTC, all the open source solutions.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:11.360]   And unfortunately, the closed source solutions like Zoom and Skype have really better -- they
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   work better.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.280]   I don't think they use it, too.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:19.320]   It's more -- I mean, the reason Zoom took off originally was because they actually bothered
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.680]   to do the bridge and deferring thing.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:21.680]   Right.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.720]   And so it was easy for them to adopt in that market.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   Right.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.480]   But I think they're running on WebRTC.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.480]   Are they?
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.920]   Well, at least the browser version runs a lot.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.920]   I'm sure the browser version is.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.840]   I've actually posted the protocol directly.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.440]   Are you using the browser version or the desktop?
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.440]   No, I'm using it.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.440]   I'm using it at the minute.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.640]   Also, it's great to have Ant Pruitt hands-on photography.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.600]   Your photo show has what this week?
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:53.080]   This week, we're going to talk with the Mad Scientist, Mr. Don Kamarachka.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.760]   We're going to look at some macro photography.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.600]   I've already spoken about macro photography, but -- I love that.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.200]   He's the man when it comes to macro photography.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.160]   So he's going to share some really, really good tips and tricks and dive into some snow
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.160]   flick stuff.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   Trick that TV.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.160]   Nice.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.160]   Hop.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   Hop.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.440]   Jason Howell, of course, Tech News Weekly.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.440]   That's right.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.440]   All about Android at during editorial meeting on Tuesday.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.800]   We're saying, "What are we going to talk about?"
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.240]   Let's talk about Facebook and the metaverse.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.000]   Then I realized, "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.280]   Apple, Google, Microsoft, AMD, and Intel are all going to announce quarterly results this
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.280]   week.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.280]   I bet you'll have something to talk about tomorrow, maybe."
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.280]   Well, that's like, actually, you know what?
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.280]   We ended up talking about the metaverse.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.280]   Good.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.440]   I want to talk about that next.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.920]   Let's do that next.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.920]   Facebook's moving into the metaverse.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.880]   And as a fan of Snow Crash, I couldn't be happier.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.920]   Our show today brought to you by Wealth Front.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.160]   I'm going to tell you something that's going to be very disappointing.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:55.680]   The secret to building wealth, to building value for you, your family, is not buying
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.200]   Bitcoin.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.080]   It's not day trading.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.920]   It's not stock picking either.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.840]   It's definitely not burying Krugerands in the backyard.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:05.840]   Oh, damn.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.840]   I know.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.520]   I'm just going to leave that off the list.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.160]   It's all a lot of fun until somebody pokes their eye out.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:19.760]   But if you want to grow your long-term wealth and you want to make it to the moon, you diamond
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.000]   hands you, you should open up an account with Wealth Front.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.200]   Wealth Front Investment Accounts.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.840]   It's not exciting.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:33.840]   It's not going to give you, you wake up in the morning and your stomach goes, "Mm-hmm."
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.120]   It's just slow and steady.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:41.720]   Whether you're saving for college, saving for a house, saving for retirement, decades,
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:46.400]   decades of data show, investors that trade individual stocks that try to beat the market
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:51.000]   by picking stocks underperform every year.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.400]   Only by a lot, there was a long bet between Warren Buffett and a famous hedge fund.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:03.200]   Warren Buffett said, "If I just buy a market basket of all the stocks, it's going to beat
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.080]   whatever you can do picking stocks."
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.080]   It did.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.080]   He won.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.120]   One percent of day traders, one percent beat the market.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.840]   The odds are not in your favor if you're trying to do it by yourself.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:19.880]   But Wealth Front can help you do it easily, securely.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.040]   It's really a great way.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.400]   You don't have to spend a lot of time reading the trades.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.160]   Investing is complicated, but it doesn't matter if you're a beginner or even if you've
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.560]   been investing for years, Wealth Front makes it easy.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.360]   I'm going to tell you why you want to use Wealth Front.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.480]   They've got the right tools for every portfolio.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:40.280]   By the way, a big number right there in front of you, 0.25%.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.200]   That's the annual advisory fee.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.880]   That's really low.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.280]   In fact, if you look and you see what you're paying in other vehicles, you're going to
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:55.600]   realize that sometimes the gains you make are eaten up by the fees.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:05.840]   Wealth Front is low fee.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.960]   I don't even want to say equities.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.280]   These are low-cost index funds personalized for you in just minutes.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.760]   There's no manual trading.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.920]   You're not going to pick stocks.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.920]   I know you want to.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   You know what?
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.800]   If you really have the hankering, go ahead and take some money, put that in a separate
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.640]   account, but that shouldn't be your long-term savings account.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.360]   You don't want to watch the stock market every day.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.600]   Yeah, that could be entertaining, but that's not how you build wealth.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.600]   Wealth Front automatically handles all the investing.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.760]   You set the preferences.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.520]   They do the rest.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.920]   What your risk tolerance is, what your goals are, what your timeframe is.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.440]   They do things that are very sophisticated too, by the way.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.640]   You can lower the taxes you pay as you invest using something called tax loss harvesting.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.160]   That's very hard to do.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.920]   They do it so well.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:56.320]   And more than cover, the low .25% of the advisory fee, and all of this is automatic.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.400]   It's people are moving to this.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.120]   Wealth Front currently is managing over $20 billion in assets.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.760]   That's how successful they are.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.240]   And we've got a great offer for you.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.160]   You can get your first $5,000 managed for free.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.800]   For life, go to wealthfront.com/twig.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.720]   At least do me a favor.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   Do that.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.440]   Start with that.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.920]   You don't never pay that .25% even.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.320]   And just watch it grow.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.080]   It only takes $500 to get started.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.600]   This is what you should be doing.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.880]   I don't care how old you are, how young you are.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880]   This is what you should be doing.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.200]   Grow your wealthy easy way.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.640]   Let Wealth Front do the work for you.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.800]   In a way, it's kind of set and forget, which I really like.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:43.040]   You're not tempted to go, "Oh, I see Intel's stock going down."
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.840]   Even though their revenue was up, "What should I do?
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.840]   Should I sell?
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:47.840]   No, he stopped.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.840]   Just let them know."
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.840]   Just let them know.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.840]   Stop the insanity.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.200]   Don't do that.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.680]   Get your first $5,000 managed for free for life.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.160]   Go to wealthfront.com/twig.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:03.160]   Weigh, F-R-O-N-T.com.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.920]   Wealthfront.com/twig.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.920]   Start growing your savings.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.240]   Please use that address so they know you saw it here.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:14.000]   Wealthfront.com/twig to get started today.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.320]   I'm such a big believer in this.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.880]   All I can say is it's tempting to do the other thing.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.200]   Do yourself a favor.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.400]   Slow and steady wins the race.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.200]   Who won the turtle and the hare?
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.440]   The turtle, right?
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.440]   The turtle.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.440]   The tortoise.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.440]   The tortoise won the title.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.280]   Be the tortoise.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:41.200]   I don't think that's their slogan.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.200]   Thank you, Wealthfront.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   Thank you, Wealthfront.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.240]   All right, metaverse.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:49.440]   So the metaverse, best first chapter in the history of science fiction, in my opinion,
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.040]   Neil Stevenson's Snow Crash.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.280]   Do you remember it?
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.480]   The pizza delivery gal.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   She's on a skateboard.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.480]   It's really exciting.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   Oh, what?
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.480]   Never mind.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.640]   Lost me in a skateboard.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.640]   Anyway, Snow Crash.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.560]   You're giving the car first and then the skateboard.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.560]   It's good, isn't it?
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.720]   You remember that, right?
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.720]   Kevin?
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   I remember that.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.720]   I was excited.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.720]   It was really great.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.720]   I don't think 92.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.720]   Things were different.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.720]   But one of the best features of Snow Crash, like all Neil Stevenson novels, ends with a
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:21.000]   whimper and not a bang, but starts with a bang.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.920]   It's actually some of his more recent novels have much better endings.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.440]   I really like Seven Eves.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.680]   But anyway, that's different.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.680]   You didn't like Seven Eves?
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.160]   The ending of Seven Eves, John?
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.160]   You wanted more.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:37.800]   Well, that maybe you can write a second one.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.800]   All right.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.360]   Jeremy's fired up.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.240]   I thought that was a great novel.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.840]   Anyway, the metaverse comes from that book, Snow Crash.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:55.080]   It is, you know, and now with Ready Player One and plenty of other science fiction creations,
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.320]   everybody's kind of aware of this notion of jacking the Matrix.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:03.240]   Jacking into a world that is so realistic, it becomes your life.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.240]   It becomes your second life.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.240]   Was it the second life, though?
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.240]   That was not the one.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.240]   Not the one.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.240]   It was the best verse.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.240]   Earlier.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.240]   Baby steps, right?
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:21.360]   It was something, but when there was nothing, honestly, I think a lot of innovation in tech
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.840]   and in science comes from the fact that we all read science fiction and we're just trying
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:28.800]   to invent that thing that we've done so cool when we were 16.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   Right.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:34.440]   The thing in metaverse about Earth, I definitely wrote that straight into a product spec and
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:39.720]   I know that the Google Earth and Google Maps guys did as well.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.160]   That basically envisioned the idea of having a globe that you could turn around with your
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.160]   hand and zoom in and out and see everything.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.480]   So that's what Google is.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.720]   Is Earth from Snow Crash?
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.720]   That's cool.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.720]   That's awesome.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.720]   See?
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   That's cool.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.720]   Thank you.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.720]   It's key in the in the cherub as well.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.440]   No, I was reading 3D Atlas at the time and we said, okay, we've done this thing with
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.440]   the CD Ron Ward.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.440]   Where do we go next?
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.240]   I said, we want to put a whole 3D globe into all this stuff.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.240]   That's so cool.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.240]   And it is still cool.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.240]   Let's not forget.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:13.200]   But let's not forget, I mean, even though we've gotten used to it, that is a very, very
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.200]   cool product.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.200]   Absolutely.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.560]   I still use it because it's just so easy to use and it allows us to go somewhere that
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.640]   we'll probably never get to go.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.600]   And really get into it.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.600]   3D and everything.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.560]   Still for the futuristic.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.840]   But that's the other part of this is that also the thing that has happened is that what's
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.640]   happened with mapping is that it has gone from a product to a commodity.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.440]   We have OpenStreetMap.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.920]   We have APIs like Leaflet and things.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:49.440]   So actually embedding maps in your website now is a line of code and the assumption that
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:54.440]   you can embed a map that has the entire earth on it and points on it and move things around
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.840]   has become, yeah, that's just common place.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.640]   It's common how it is.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:07.560]   And OpenStreetMap is an impressive achievement there in that it has managed to gather lots
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:12.440]   of the other companies, apart from Google, to collaborate and work on that.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:16.480]   So a lot of the data from that, Microsoft and Apple are feeding into that as well and putting
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.160]   stuff back out again too.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.160]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.160]   I didn't realize that.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.160]   It was, yeah.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.200]   Because the original idea of OpenStreetMap was it would be kind of crowd sourced, right?
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.200]   It would be like, yeah.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   And still it is.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.000]   You can open up OpenStreetMap now and fix things.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.880]   I've added, you know, paths and things here.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.960]   And still do that.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.000]   But in terms of, and also it's very flexible.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.160]   You can do, anyone can construct new map layers from it.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.520]   So there's lots of different kinds of map layers that you can construct from it and
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.520]   get custom versions.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.160]   You're not waiting for Apple or people to update their product for it to look different.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.920]   So that's a powerful thing.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:58.000]   So part of the question for the sort of the metaverse stuff is how much of it will be
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.120]   a back between the giants about who owns the tech and the specs for that and how much
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.600]   of all we stuff that gets pushed out into those kinds of layers.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.680]   And that's, you know, with, I mean, the nice thing about the Earth is that we have a sort
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.000]   of agreed coordinate system.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.720]   I mean, okay, we have two or three, but basically there's a primary coordinate system that we
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.920]   all use and you can cross check that with a GPS and you can cross check that with other
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.880]   people's maps and see does this thing fit where it belongs.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:29.120]   And part of the challenge of the metaverse stuff is saying what they've done so far has
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:34.640]   been like tabletop VR where it's okay, we're putting things in your room most of the time.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.040]   And there's, and the idea of putting stuff in the world, which they're starting to do
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:44.400]   now means you need that kind of shared model of the world that we have for mapping, but
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.880]   you needed a much higher resolution.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.080]   I need to have buildings and things in it as well.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:53.520]   When you hit the question of if I'm putting on my goals and scanning the neighborhood,
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.800]   if I'm doing that out of doors, fair enough, we can share that.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:00.040]   If I'm doing the indoors, you probably don't want that to be uploaded to an open street
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.000]   map like thing or even a Facebook like thing.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.760]   You didn't necessarily want them to have a model of the inside of your house, but that's
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.560]   what you're constructing.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:11.120]   So sort of the models around how we do that and what counts as public space gets a lot
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.120]   messier.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:18.040]   I forgot you have a lot of expertise in history in this area actually completely forgot.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:23.600]   Well, I'm talking about one of the things I did recently, well, fairly recently, the
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.200]   last couple of years was I've been working for a part of the UK government called Digital
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:33.040]   Catapult and two years ago we wrote a thing called Who Will Own the Metaverse, which was
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.960]   trying to think through some of these pieces and draw things together.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.960]   Interesting.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.000]   And the question is, there's companies who are thinking about this, Nantex and other
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   ones, they've basically built this.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   They've built the world.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   They've grown and they are overlay for it.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   Right.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.560]   And then they've used that for Pokemon Go and they're now building a platform that you
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.800]   can boot your own games on top of that and starting to think about how to sell that
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   out.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:50:02.520]   So they've done some of that mapping stuff that is based around the idea of not just
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.120]   where the earth is, but where are places you can actually play on the earth so they can
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:11.320]   tell the difference between a public park and a railway line and make sure that they
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.360]   put the Pokemon in the park and not on the railway line.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:19.240]   You said Microsoft had some ambitions with this, with HoloLens, their mixed reality.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:23.360]   They made a Minecraft earth that was kind of a Pokemon Go.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:28.240]   You could build Minecraft stuff in the real world and they killed it.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.080]   Yeah, it didn't last very long.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:36.720]   They launched it and it was neat, but did it ever even get like an official public release?
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:37.880]   I had to get every got out of beta.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.880]   I played with it and it was a little.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.840]   It was like, it felt like, oh, we're so close.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:46.040]   But that's part of the problem with all of this is the technology really isn't there
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.200]   yet.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.240]   But now is the time of starting thinking about it.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.240]   Right.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.240]   For sure.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.240]   But the part of it is, you know, bits of it are one which run to fit the pieces together
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.280]   and make it, but to actually overlay things on the real world in real time, you need a
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.000]   bunch of stuff to work very, very well.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.120]   Microsoft was really using it to show off there.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.120]   What was it called?
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.360]   Azure, something points, map points.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.360]   That's right.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:10.200]   They had a cloud based kind of geo coordinate system.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.920]   So the multiple people could be in different places.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.680]   They were looking at the same thing interacting.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:18.360]   So all of this is in the news again because Mark Zuckerberg, you know, it's clear the
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:21.320]   Facebook's had this kind of ambition since they bought Oculus, right?
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.480]   Well, yeah, they've been talking about this for a while.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   There's Verizon.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:31.120]   So he was talking to Casey Newton and he called the metaverse, the successor to the
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.120]   mobile internet.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.480]   That clarifies a little bit what he, what he thinks of it.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:41.840]   And this got a lot of attention pledged to turn Facebook from a social media company
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.920]   to a metaverse company.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:49.720]   When I see that line, I'm thinking about that Oculus that you gifted me and how I don't
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.560]   touch it anymore because of those news.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.560]   That's why I gave it to you.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.560]   I was like, wait a minute.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.360]   I can't do this unless I have a Facebook account.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.360]   That one you can use.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.360]   That one I think you can use.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.360]   That's the first quest one.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:02.360]   He has the original one.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.360]   I don't know.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:06.360]   It seems like I remember seeing a banner pop up one time.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.360]   What's your Facebook?
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.360]   Yeah, I think Facebook will try.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.360]   Oh, no way.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.360]   I'll attempt on that.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.360]   That's why I never get the quest too.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.120]   If it's not required, then maybe I'll keep playing it because I enjoyed it.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:20.280]   So they have, according to protocol all in on the metaverse, they're reorganizing to
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.880]   build a metaverse product group.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.800]   It'll be headed by Vishal Shah, who's currently VP of product at Instagram.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.960]   Facebook gaming VP Vivek Sharma will be leading development of something the company calls
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:35.160]   their Horizons VR world.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.040]   We've seen some of that.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.720]   That's out in prototype.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:43.720]   A gaming executive from Facebook, Jason Rubin, will be there as well.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:48.600]   And they'll all be reporting to Facebook's VP of AR and VR Andrew Bosworth.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:54.680]   He announced on Monday, he announced the founding of this group with these words to
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.760]   remember.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.800]   To achieve our full version of the metaverse, we need to build.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:03.960]   And I think this is kind of what you were talking about, Kevin, the connective tissue
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.040]   between these spaces.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:10.920]   So you can remove the limitations of physics and move between them with the same ease moving
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:16.000]   from one room in your home to the next to focus our efforts and deliver on this vision.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.200]   We're bringing together the teams that have been driving some of this fundamental work.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:27.080]   Maybe I'm misunderstanding it, but it is true that on the Rift and the HTC Vive, moving
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.840]   around is really hard because you can't actually walk from place to place.
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.840]   No, and even even on the quest.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.400]   I mean, the quest has come a long way of how do they do it?
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.760]   You point and you say, take me there.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.280]   You point with the controller and take me.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.480]   Well, I'm talking about like free motion walking.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.480]   Like, yes, you can.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.600]   You can use your controller or you can walk around with the quest.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.000]   Well, they've talked about that using cameras.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.600]   It's wireless and you can draw your safe zone.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.080]   I can't remember what they call it.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.240]   But even with the past two camera, it's still pretty tenuous.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.400]   Like, it's better than not having a camera.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.120]   You see a wire frame of the room, right?
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   You just never know where that when that corner that you forgot to draw out is going to like
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.920]   peg you in the forehead, it's going to take you to the floor.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.280]   So there's always a little bit of that, you know?
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.680]   So they've got a ways to go.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:13.080]   In the ready player one, of course, the guy had a all day on a treadmill, right?
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:17.080]   Kind of weird, you know, on a 360 degree treadmill, you can move in any direction.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.440]   He was attached to the last sticks and it looked very uncomfortable.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.200]   And to be honest with you.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   But it is true.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.120]   I actually tested that for his sabers.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.880]   I remember it was very uncomfortable.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.880]   Yes.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.880]   It was really weird.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.880]   It was not normal.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.880]   It was not natural.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.880]   Why do you probably want to have a haptic so people kick you in the leg and think, "Ow!"
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:37.880]   Oh man.
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.880]   Because what we want is pain.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.880]   You had a full haptic suit.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:46.160]   But I mean, the other problem you have with the AR stuff makes some sense.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.920]   So the thing that Antigua says, "Okay, we'll put you out in the world and you're playing
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:49.920]   in the world."
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.040]   Or, you know, Google does the AR navigation now, which can be quite useful.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.240]   I'm kind of more of a believer in that.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.600]   The mixed reality or augmented reality kind of vision.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.600]   That's not a matter of this.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.600]   But the challenge there, well, yeah, that's my question.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:05.640]   Well, it can be a matter of this, but then you've got to be in the right place.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   Right.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.960]   If I'm standing on top of this pill in Yorkshire, then there's no one else around.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:10.960]   Right.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.760]   And I couldn't, you know, I could...
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.760]   Sounds awesome.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:17.000]   Antigua's actually been struggling with that in Pokemon Go.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.960]   Because you can do a rate if you're approximate to a gym.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:24.240]   But during COVID, they added the ability to do remote rating.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.240]   You're still playing.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.240]   Kevin, you're still playing.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.240]   I can tell you're nodding.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:31.280]   No, it's just my son works for them, so I know how I know something.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.280]   Oh, he does!
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.280]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   I didn't know that.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.960]   Well, tell him he's doing a really good job and not to take back the COVID enhancements
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.120]   because it made the game much more fun.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.120]   But it is the challenge.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:47.360]   The challenge you have with AR is especially even if you're just doing for data overlays,
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.400]   if I want to look down on the city, I've got to go and climb a hill to look at it.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.400]   Right.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.360]   Or I've got to decide how to fly.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.360]   And you hit the same problem.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:59.280]   Any of these mapping things, you hit all these projection problems of what makes sense and
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.280]   what doesn't.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:04.120]   And you'll see the classic SKCD thing of everything's population density.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.680]   And so everything you, every piece of data overlay ends up just being a map of where people
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.680]   live.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.440]   So you hit a bunch of sort of weird...
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:15.720]   It's kind of a great goo problem of the metaverse, right?
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.560]   Everything's all kind of the same.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:21.280]   I'm still kind of foggy on what exactly it means to be a metaverse.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:24.000]   Now I never read Snow Crash, so that's probably part of the reason.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.360]   Maybe I'm admitting something that I shouldn't be admitting out loud.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.880]   Don't worry, there's two of us in the room.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:28.880]   Don't hurt me.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.080]   Okay, there we go.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:32.040]   But like, it's a fairly quick read.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.040]   It's quite fun.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.040]   Oh, it's really good.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.040]   It's thick.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.640]   You may say it's a quick read, but it's a pretty thick book.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:49.180]   You know, British
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:56.180]   movie.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.180]   Oh, that sounds approachable.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:59.180]   It feels that one.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:01.180]   Boy, is it on Audible?
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:02.180]   Yes, it is.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.900]   Even on Audible, that sounds approachable.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:06.180]   Even Audible had it divided into six different books.
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:07.180]   Wow.
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:08.180]   Oh my goodness.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.820]   So what was the point of getting around him not finishing his books, wasn't it?
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:12.620]   He wrote six on the glue together.
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.180]   But no, so the basic...
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.940]   I mean, Snow Crash has a bunch of deep stuff.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.660]   It has some good mythos things in it as well.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:24.140]   But the basic idea is the world is split into strange commercial franchises, but there's
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:28.180]   another shared world that everyone can go into, which is the metaverse, which involves
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.180]   headsets and wandering around.
[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.180]   And it was...
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.020]   It's interesting because it predates the web.
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:36.500]   It was written before the web was mainstream.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:40.180]   And so it's thinking about the web from a VR point of view.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.180]   So it's kind of...
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:42.180]   Okay.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:43.180]   I mean, it's sort of a history-thology thing.
[00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:46.020]   You know, the other one that's fun like that is, which I've mentioned on this show before,
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:52.180]   is Douglas Adams' Hyperland, which was made in '89, '90, and was an exploration of how
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.220]   we do hypertext just before the web existed.
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:58.380]   And so it ends up wandering off into VR and doing weird stuff like that.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:57:59.380]   Interesting.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:01.980]   And there's some of this is like old tech that keeps coming back.
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:05.380]   You know, we've had imagined VR worlds for a very long time.
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.380]   Sure.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:11.380]   You know, there's an entire genre of movies from the '90s that are different kinds of
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:14.220]   imagined VR worlds because it appeals very much to the filmmaker.
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:16.140]   You know, Tron loved it.
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.140]   Lawmore man.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:20.460]   It's cheap because you don't have to build a set.
[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:21.460]   Right.
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.340]   Well, no, Tron was expensive because they didn't have to...
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:26.260]   They didn't have to turn on the way in '80s.
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.260]   So yeah.
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:28.260]   But that was crossy.
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:32.020]   And by the way, you saw all the money on the screen, didn't you?
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:33.020]   I mean, you're...
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:36.060]   Hey, at the time, it was hot.
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.100]   It was shade there.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:40.780]   I think this is the problem is that fiction can imagine this.
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:41.780]   We can imagine this.
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:47.220]   And it's appealing, this notion of a world that's not of the world that you can go and
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:51.380]   it's really escape and you can fly, you can do anything you want.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:52.900]   And it's so real that you can't...
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:56.020]   It's almost impossible to distinguish it from the real world.
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.100]   And that's not...
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.980]   I think it's...
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.140]   You consider...
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:08.420]   It's not such a hard reach from a conceptual idea because you're really already in the
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:10.220]   metaverse.
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:17.220]   We only see the real world through these engines of our sensorium, the senses.
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.180]   And the real world actually looks nothing.
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:21.540]   I think, I don't know, because I've not been there.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:24.380]   Nothing like the world we're seeing, but we interpret it with our brains.
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:28.460]   So in effect, we are already in the concept of a metaverse.
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:29.980]   Is that what Elon Musk said?
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.700]   Yeah, he thinks we're in a simulation.
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.660]   That's a little step beyond that, which I'm not convinced is wrong, but I just don't
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.060]   think there's any way to prove how to even put it.
[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:39.060]   That's absolutely similar.
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:40.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:44.140]   Well, no, it's just that right now, your perception of the world comes from touch smells.
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.140]   Right.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.660]   And then the limited levels of touch smells.
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:48.660]   Right.
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:49.660]   Like we don't even experience the entire...
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:50.660]   Not even close.
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.900]   If it did, you'd get an overwhelm.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:53.900]   Yeah, true.
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:57.260]   And your eyes are seeing everything upside down because of the way lenses work, so your
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.260]   brain is correcting...
[00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:59.460]   Coverses and flips it around.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.460]   I mean, so there's...
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.620]   Well, in my mind right now...
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.020]   Your brain...
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.860]   We are in a metaverse in effect.
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:12.100]   You know, we're in an imagined constructed reality based on what is out there, but it's
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.220]   not necessarily exactly the same.
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.020]   So I understand why conceptually it's easy.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:21.420]   I think technically it's much more difficult and the problems to solve are almost intractable.
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:30.340]   You know, until you can actually have a wetware interface, you know, what are the cyberpunk
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:35.940]   version of the metaverse, Gibson's version, the metaverse, you plug in.
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:42.380]   I was just going to say it seems to me what we're craving it, but what we expect is something
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:46.980]   that takes our current perception of what reality is and sensation and all that and
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.980]   replaces it with something that's like a one to one replacement.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.980]   That doesn't come from putting a VR headset on and putting a controller in your hand because
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.820]   that's very different from what we experience in a regular basis.
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:01.180]   It has to be something that plugs into you in short circuits or something your actual
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.180]   sensory system.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:07.700]   Kevin, from your experience with these companies, I mean, this is obviously super blue sky.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:12.420]   If this were IBM, this would be considered like you put these guys off in a building
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.540]   somewhere far away in Armonk.
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:17.900]   This is very, very blue sky for Facebook.
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.900]   But everybody's doing it.
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.460]   It's like Waymo in a way.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.140]   It's turning out to be a harder problem.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:29.340]   How important is it because these companies are trying to find the next big thing and they're
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:34.620]   really reaching or it seems like everybody in tech's doing this?
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:35.620]   That is part of it.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:40.340]   I mean, part of it is that the obvious technology progression that we have had has gone.
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:45.560]   Things were getting smaller and we were carrying them around and we've gone from that desk
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:50.060]   tops to laptops to phones and we try to risk things that didn't really do much.
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.940]   And part of that is what if we attach the displays to our faces?
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:58.700]   I mean, it's been a trope, as I said, since the 80s.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.620]   And the question is, can we actually do that?
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.980]   I think we can, but not with attaching things to our faces.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:05.980]   Right, right, right.
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.180]   And that's with a lot of them look weird.
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:11.260]   Well, Google Glass is trying not to attach your glass.
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.740]   You have a little screen here.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:20.980]   And whatever the project's called, the Google one is supposed to not involve screens over
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.220]   your face, but light filled things.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:26.500]   That one they bought, which has gone a bit quiet.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:31.140]   So there's there's there's sort of ways to try and do it, but the challenge is always,
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:35.700]   but you've also got to either replace your entire visual field with something compelling,
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.820]   which is very hard to do for more than a few minutes at a time.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:42.100]   If you spend more than half an hour in one of those things, you do end up feeling a bit
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.100]   more obvious.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.100]   You want to throw up?
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.100]   Yeah.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.100]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:50.260]   It's an intense gaming thing rather than a I would spend my work day in this type thing.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.260]   Right.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:54.300]   And so the question, you know, they've been so funny because we're still seeing Microsoft
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.340]   videos of people spending their work days in these things.
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.340]   Yeah, this is, yeah.
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:00.660]   It does seem like much fun.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.460]   The Microsoft team was that weird thing where they were putting the people in the same shared
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:05.460]   space.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:06.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.260]   They had to fake their faces because their faces were all covered in in goggles.
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.420]   And they had no legs, I think.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:16.660]   Which is one of the plot points of Snackratch, but the point of Snowcrash was there was only
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.100]   22 cared about people's faces and that was actually the most important part of what they
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.100]   were doing.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:27.180]   But they had to invent like laser scanning your eyeballs and things to make it work.
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.980]   And I'm not sure I really want a laser scanning my eyeballs controlled by something written
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.220]   by Facebook, not that.
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:37.900]   Mr. Kevin, I don't know if you have the answer to this, but what do shareholders or stakeholders
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:42.780]   and all of these tech companies are they saying, hey, why aren't we looking into VR more and
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:43.780]   AR more?
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:44.780]   Is that what's that?
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:50.700]   Is the push coming from the people with the money or is this truly just development and
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.060]   wishful thinking and wanting to try to make the dramatic?
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.020]   I think it is more from the tech side.
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:59.700]   I think it's more that people have had this dream for a long time that you can replace
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.060]   the world with your computer.
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:05.700]   And so they're, you know, palm of luck.
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.900]   You say, well, why don't I just build it and he built it and built something that's sort
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:12.180]   of half worked and then Facebook bought it, bought him.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:18.380]   And there's been a whole series of companies that have been doing this for a long time.
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.500]   And the originally would sell to the military and things like that.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:26.060]   There are good heads up display things, but they're still very expensive.
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:29.940]   And what they've been trying to do, you know, Google's Google did the, what if we just stick
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:32.260]   your phone to your face thing with cardboard?
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.260]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.260]   But you did that.
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.260]   Google has killed now.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:39.260]   One of the reasons these phones, doesn't mind if it doesn't get it's getting cumbersome.
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.260]   Oh, look at that.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.260]   It's magic.
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.260]   That's the perfect thing.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.260]   You're in the metaverse.
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:47.060]   Are you supposed to show that?
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:53.340]   But part of the, you know, I was saying part of the reason these phones had such, um, you
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.300]   know, this is, this phone's got a four case cream, which makes no sense as a phone.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:05:00.020]   It made sense as a thing in cardboard because if it's that far from your screen, right?
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.020]   Right.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.980]   Then a four case cream makes sense.
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:05.700]   And so, you know, it's bad for battery life.
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:06.700]   It's costs more.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:07.700]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:08.700]   And you can't tell it.
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.940]   There's no real visible difference unless you're using a microscope tooling.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:12.940]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.940]   Sometimes I think we've gotten the wrong way in any case.
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:19.100]   I'm one of two people that enjoyed using daydream back in the day.
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.100]   Yeah, it was neat.
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.100]   No, I liked it.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:25.540]   Me and Hulu or me and Netflix on one of my armchairs and some really, you'd watch
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:26.540]   a whole show that way.
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:27.540]   Oh, it was great.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.700]   It was just, it was so relaxing because it's an individual movie theater.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.860]   Yeah, everything was quiet on the floor.
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:33.860]   No interrupt.
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:38.660]   I, I, by the way, I want to, I do want to point out we do have an amazing, I'm going
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:42.540]   to say very advanced, very mature technology that does that.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:44.380]   It's called movies.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:48.020]   Even though you're not attaching it to your face, you go in a dark room, you look at
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:52.460]   a large screen, they use music, they use drama, they use sound.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.820]   They are very effective.
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:54.820]   There's people there.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.820]   Well, that's why I don't go to the theater.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:02.860]   Yeah, but if you, okay, nowadays, yeah, but if you go to see 1917 as an example and it's
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:08.220]   all shot kind of first person on the spot, that is a virtual reality experience.
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.220]   It is.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.940]   Yes, if you're not too aware of the fact that you're sitting in the theater, because I know
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.380]   exactly what you're talking about.
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:18.380]   There are times where I'm watching something and I get so immersed that I forget that I'm
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.380]   watching something.
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:20.380]   Yes.
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.380]   I'm in a good movie.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.380]   Does that.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.380]   Yes.
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.380]   Absolutely.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.380]   Absolutely.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.380]   And it is a very advanced technology.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.380]   It's a hundred year old technology.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.380]   We've gotten very, very good.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.380]   And you know it's a good movie because you laugh, you cry.
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.380]   There's nothing to laugh and cry at.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:37.300]   You're sitting in a room looking at a screen with light on, projected on it.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.380]   But it's making you cry.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.100]   That's a virtual reality experience.
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:42.100]   That's amazing.
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.460]   We're very, very good at that.
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:44.460]   So I don't.
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.460]   But that was the challenge.
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.500]   I mean, and we do have that with gaming.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:52.260]   We have the ability to explore free, explore a really well with gaming.
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.780]   And you've got to pick enough TV.
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.580]   You can most interactivity is the problem.
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.580]   That's difficult.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:00.860]   But the opportunity is there with gaming.
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:05.700]   I have to admit, when I play Valheim, when I actually got a sense of this, even though
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:11.860]   Valheim, which is a silly Viking survival game that people know I'm a little upset, was
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.860]   a little upset.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:13.860]   Wait, you play Valheim?
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:14.860]   Have you heard?
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.500]   By the way, I play Valheim.
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:22.740]   But I was playing it on a 55 inch, 5k monitor arm's length away from me.
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.740]   So it was immersive.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.740]   You were immersive.
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.660]   And it, I got to the point where I felt like, you know what?
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:33.140]   I understand how you could think this was your, this was you in a another world.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.660]   And you were having another experience.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.180]   Especially if you play about eight hours a day, which I was doing at its peak.
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:39.180]   That was my life.
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.180]   Wow.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.180]   And it was interactive.
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:43.100]   And you know, it's funny that graphics weren't super good.
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.100]   They were okay.
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:48.580]   The physics, it's funny that the textures were low quality, but the physics, the lighting,
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.220]   and everything was superb.
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:52.700]   So there was an interesting mix.
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.260]   But it wasn't that it was so realistic.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.860]   It was, but it somehow was immersive.
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.180]   So we are, we can do it.
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.900]   I'm getting lost in Minecraft and that's, that's, you know, that's right.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.900]   Even lower quality.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:02.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.500]   I should see the things I've built in Minecraft.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.420]   But that's part of it.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.500]   It's like we're still feeding around the edges of these pieces.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.500]   Totally.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.780]   And I feel that's that thing I linked to was like, we've got all these different parts.
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:18.460]   We're trying to find the pieces of it together and work out how they work.
[01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:19.820]   And all these companies are trying to do that.
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:24.260]   But it's still, yeah, the problem is what is the, what is the, what is the compelling
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.260]   thing that you can do with this?
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.420]   You can't do with anything else.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.580]   Can it get good enough to subsume everything?
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:33.820]   Or will it be sort of pieces of it that we slice off that it's like, okay, it's good
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:34.820]   for gaming.
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.260]   If you do it this way, it's good for watching movies.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:40.780]   If you do it this way, it's good for walking around the world and finding things.
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:43.860]   If you do it this way, is there a unified thing there or not?
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:45.340]   And that's the piece that they're all wrestling with.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:50.980]   It's, it's easy to see how right now at this point in the development of technology that,
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:55.780]   let's say the VR headset is the closest that we can get to a metaverse or is the beginning
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:59.020]   building blocks when you're talking about, you know, when you're talking about movies
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.180]   being around for a hundred years.
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:06.740]   Like it's, we as humans for the last hundred years have also like conditioned ourselves
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:12.180]   through the creation, through the consuming of movies to lose ourselves into it in the
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.180]   way that you have.
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:14.180]   We were complicit.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.500]   And now we're, we're, we're participating in that regard.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.780]   Now we're at the beginning of this next phase, let's say, and I'm not saying that Mark Zuckerberg
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:24.060]   is going to be the one to do it, but we're at the beginning of the next phase of what
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.060]   that develops out into.
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:28.820]   And of course it's going to be pretty infantile in the beginning.
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:29.820]   Yeah.
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.740]   And there's going to be a lot of holes to poke into it.
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:35.700]   But I'm, I'm pretty convinced that at some point down the line, we could be a lot closer
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.180]   to whatever this metaverse thing actually is.
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:41.420]   And yes, where we're at right now is the foundation of that, or at least it's the beginning
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:42.420]   of it.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.420]   So there's something to be said.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   I was hoping that I'd be able to jack in.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.420]   From the nursing home.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:53.940]   And, and, and experience a whole life with that, you know, and in my later years, I don't
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.660]   think it's going to happen in my lifetime.
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:56.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:57.660]   I think it's 80 years off.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.700]   I think it's, you know, it's within, maybe it's within your lifetime.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:01.700]   It's not.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.100]   It's been 10 years off for 40 years.
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.100]   Exactly.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.100]   Right.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:07.100]   Totally.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.100]   It's funny.
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.420]   There's a, the, the kind of the seminal article on this was written about a year ago by Matthew
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.460]   Ball's adventure capitalist, the metaverse, what it is, where to find it, who will build
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:14.460]   it and for it.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.460]   And he talks a lot.
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:19.780]   He actually, it's an interesting article I recommended, but he talks about Vannevar Bush's
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:25.540]   famous article from 1945 called Memex, which really predicted the internet.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.580]   As we, as people think.
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:29.580]   As we will think.
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:30.580]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:31.580]   That's right.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:32.580]   That was the name of it.
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:33.580]   He talked about the Memex.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.780]   So that was 80 years ago.
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:39.700]   So it might, you know, you can conceive of it long before you can make it.
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.620]   And we can see all the technical challenges.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:42.620]   Yes.
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:46.820]   But you, but I don't, I think we're, you know, we're conceiving of it for sure.
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.820]   And I think it will happen eventually.
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:54.340]   You know, but at the same time, we look at so much horsepower in air quotes that's, that
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.860]   we care around in our pockets with these phones.
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:11:02.980]   And then you have things like that M1 chip from Apple and what the iPad is able to do.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.740]   And you, you would wonder, why aren't we there yet?
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:09.900]   Because we have so much hardware prowess going on right now.
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:14.700]   You know, well, we have a lot compared to what we had 10 years ago, but not, not enough
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.820]   yet to create a metaverse.
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.300]   Mm hmm.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.140]   And we're slowing down a little bit.
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:24.780]   Although by the way, I just learned that we are going to stop talking about nanometers.
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.780]   Did you see this?
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:30.380]   I've never understood the significance in nanometers.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:34.740]   I know you talk about like what Microsoft hasn't been able to do versus Intel.
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:38.740]   Not Microsoft Intel.
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:39.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:43.020]   They're still at the 14 and 10 nanometer and TSMC is announced the two nanometer.
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:47.380]   But some companies are calling that the 20A or 20 Angstrom size.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.260]   We are now into Angstroms.
[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:50.260]   Angstroms.
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:51.260]   Oh boy.
[01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.260]   Okay.
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:57.580]   So 20 Angstroms is two nanometers.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:58.580]   I don't know.
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.260]   What's the layman's description of what we're talking about?
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:05.100]   Because it isn't really accurate anymore because it used to be, it used to be related
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.660]   to transistor density.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:10.980]   And you can see the more transistors you could put on the chip, the more power the chip
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:11.980]   could possibly have.
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:12.980]   That was Andy.
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.700]   That was, who's law?
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.060]   Gosh, now I've more.
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:17.060]   More is law.
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.780]   And it was double.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.220]   It was more predictive.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:24.180]   The number of transistors on a chip would double every 18 months.
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.220]   It did for a long time.
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:27.220]   I don't know if it still is.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:31.220]   But that really comes down to how small you can make that process, right?
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.860]   The transistor is smaller and smaller.
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:37.020]   So what you're really measuring, I think, Kevin, correct me when you talk about 10 nanometers
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:42.820]   or 2 nanometers used to be the size of the traces, right?
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:45.940]   The connected these things.
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:50.420]   But now it no longer applies because it's not a two dimensional field of transistors.
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.420]   They're stacked.
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:52.420]   No.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:56.020]   So now it's more like 10 nanometer equivalent or 2 nanometer equivalent.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.780]   You're really what you should be talking about is transistor density.
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:01.500]   That's the real number you're talking about.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.340]   And they, I don't know.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:04.340]   Are they going up?
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:06.500]   Are they doubling 18 every 18 months anymore?
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.500]   I don't know.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.820]   No, that stopped happening.
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:14.780]   Basically, what they were measuring there is to stop happening.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:18.940]   What happened was that they started optimizing on different constraints.
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:23.540]   So rather than doubling the density, they started worrying about power consumption and
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:24.940]   optimizing that up.
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.420]   And also, it was also doubling clock rate was the other thing they were thinking about.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:30.140]   But that ended up causing problems too.
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.620]   Because that made multiple cores.
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:32.620]   Multiple cores.
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:33.620]   Multiple cores.
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.740]   Because heat became a big problem.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:42.220]   Although, I have to say, the M1, Apple's M1, has 16 billion transistors on something
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.380]   the size of your phone.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.380]   Wow.
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:45.380]   That's a big problem.
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:46.380]   It's a little plausible.
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:47.380]   I don't even get it.
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.380]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:49.380]   Yeah, that's remarkable.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:53.460]   But yeah, I guess Moore's law, I think Intel ran into this with maybe it was even back
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:58.460]   to the Itanium where it was just so hot and the clock speeds were stalled.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:03.180]   And so they just decided, you know what we got to do is we got to put more cores.
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:07.180]   And then it required software being redesigned to take advantage of those cores.
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:08.260]   And a lot of software still does.
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:12.260]   I was going to say people like Adobe still struggle with that.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.260]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.260]   And there are only a few things.
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:18.340]   You know, a Gaussian blur, you're going to maybe you're going to go off and split that
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.340]   up.
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:20.340]   Yeah.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:21.340]   But most of us still just--
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:22.780]   When you're typing, one thing's waiting for you.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.780]   That's all.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:26.020]   And waiting a long time.
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.940]   Let's take a little time out.
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:31.980]   Kevin Marks, great to have you.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:32.980]   Mr. Ant Pruitt.
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.260]   And of course, Jason Howell.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:37.580]   Do you have a good to all about Android?
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.660]   Your return to the seat, the chair.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:40.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.820]   It was good to be back.
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.700]   Flow, I forgot, was away on vacation.
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:45.700]   Oh, damn it.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.700]   I almost got you all together.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.140]   Next week, next week, it's going to happen.
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:50.140]   Yes.
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.140]   And we've got Russell Holly joining us.
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:52.140]   Oh, I love Russell.
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.140]   He's great.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.140]   He's a scene at now.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:55.140]   But yeah, it was great.
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:56.140]   It was just me and Ron hanging out.
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:57.140]   Had a blast.
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.140]   Always do.
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.140]   Love that show.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:00.140]   And Berkless, too.
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.140]   Right.
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.140]   And Berkless.
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:03.140]   We have Victor back on the ones and twos.
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:04.780]   So, you know, it's a good type.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.660]   I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:08.140]   Mr. Berk was the TD.
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.140]   Was he?
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:10.140]   Yeah, he was the TD.
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.140]   Well, during COVID.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.140]   Now, Victor's doing it.
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.980]   And yeah, Victor was before.
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:15.780]   And so, he's back during the lockdown.
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:16.780]   He's back here.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.780]   So, we got to introduce everybody to Berk on that show.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:21.780]   Ah!
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:25.020]   All right, on we go with the show.
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.860]   Oh, Blizzard.
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:28.260]   Oh, Blizzard.
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.060]   Oh, Blizzard.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.980]   You see the latest?
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:35.020]   I haven't checked Twitter to see where everything is on.
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.460]   So, Blizzard's in a lot of trouble.
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:41.100]   Activision's in a lot of trouble because they're getting the employees have walked out.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:45.860]   Big demonstration because of the hostile work environment.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:52.460]   And now pictures are emerging of Blizzard's infamous Bill Cosby suite.
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:54.380]   Oh, son of a mother.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:55.380]   Oh, no.
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:57.740]   Oh, I hadn't heard about that one.
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:58.740]   Oh, boy.
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:05.780]   I think, look, I understand game development, maybe a little bro-culturing, right?
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:11.500]   And the guys who do it are maybe are bros, which is too bad because I'm sure there are
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:16.140]   a lot of wonderful women, talented women who would want to be on those teams but don't
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:18.780]   want to be involved in the Cosby suite.
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:19.780]   Right.
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:20.780]   No.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:27.380]   Activision really has a problem and their employees are really talking about it.
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:31.900]   One of the people has been named in a sexual harassment lawsuit, Sadisla.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.620]   He was pretty appalling.
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:36.780]   The lawsuit calls it the "Bill Crosby" room.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.460]   I think that's just a...
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.420]   I don't think there is a Bill Crosby.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:46.500]   I think it's a typo from a lawyer who doesn't know what he's talking about.
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.940]   And Activision says, "Oh, no, no.
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:53.980]   We called it the Crosby room because it was a conference room that the carpet reminded
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.140]   us of Bill Cosby's sweaters.
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:58.100]   This is not holding up.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:03.780]   They also have Cosby's sweets at game conventions, Blizzcon.
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:05.740]   This is back in 2013.
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:11.180]   And of course, these are important if you want to be hired by Activision, if you want
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:16.780]   to become part of the World of Warcraft team or you just want to talk with these people.
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:22.380]   But does any woman going to want to go to the Bill Cosby suite?
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.380]   No.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.980]   It's just...
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:26.980]   I mean, it's bad.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:27.980]   It is bad.
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:28.980]   And bad.
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:33.100]   I mean, I'm not super up on my Blizzard background.
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:37.020]   You know, I've heard some things about Activision over the years.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:42.180]   But Blizzard as a company, from my understanding from the outside looking in, has long been
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:43.180]   a pretty...
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:45.140]   I don't know, a pretty positive place.
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:46.620]   Like I know a lot of people who have worked there.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.140]   We've never used to have worked there.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.140]   Scott Johnson.
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.140]   Scott Johnson.
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.140]   And then Patrick Bezia.
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:53.140]   Patrick Bezia.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.140]   I used to work there.
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:18:01.820]   And I feel like the sentiment that I've heard about Blizzard from them in many years past
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:06.020]   has been pretty darn positive that Blizzard is a pretty awesome company.
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:10.180]   I mean, it just goes to show same story, different company.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:16.420]   This stuff more and more as it should is being aired and attention is being paid to this.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.420]   Like I said, as it should.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:24.100]   And I think an indictment of the corporate culture when you see...
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:28.220]   And read the Kotaku article because I don't even want to talk about some of this stuff.
[01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:29.220]   It's so horrible.
[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:35.140]   But this was tolerated as part of the corporate culture is sad.
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:42.180]   Fortunately, a lot of the country is trying to evolve and get out of all of this ridiculous
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:46.540]   behavior that was considered normal over the last couple of decades.
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:51.740]   And I hope that's the case with Activision and Blizzard and...
[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:56.420]   They're making noises about doing something about it.
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.700]   Apparently, I didn't know this.
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:01.060]   There's problems in Azeroth.
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:07.780]   There's some sexism in the actual world of Warcraft.
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:15.980]   I don't know exactly sexist comments or some of the places apparently in Azeroth are named
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:19.300]   after various people.
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.780]   I don't know.
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:23.020]   It's pretty dis-sasteful.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.700]   So I don't know what to say about it.
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:33.340]   It's just that now with the emergence of this, it's starting to look even worse.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:34.340]   Yeah.
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.980]   A lot of employees walking out.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:41.180]   I believe our first interview tomorrow in T&W is with someone who is at the walkout.
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.180]   Oh, good.
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:44.460]   So we're going to definitely be talking about this on the show tomorrow.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:48.860]   Blizzard's CEO announced last night the company's previous statements.
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:54.220]   He's apologizing for the apologies now, have been tone deaf and pledged to make some changes
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:57.980]   to the company going forward, including investigating all managers currently at the company to
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:05.660]   see whether they ever impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims.
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:09.300]   The problem is it only happened because of a lawsuit.
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.260]   You got to wonder what the commitment is to this.
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:12.260]   Yep, that's it.
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.260]   By now, anyway.
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:14.260]   All right.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:17.580]   I don't, we don't normally report on that stuff, but it's such a big story.
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:21.260]   When I read that Kataku story, it was like, oh, my gosh.
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:25.260]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:35.860]   Facebook won in a district court, but in a court filing today, attorney general, attorneys
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:42.180]   general from 45 states, DC and Guam say they will appeal last month's decision that threw
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:45.660]   out the suit against Facebook.
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:48.620]   Part of the problem was the judge says, you haven't defined monopoly.
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:53.100]   You've just, you ask us to assume that it's a monopoly.
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:58.420]   And they also was an issue with the time frame.
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:03.300]   The judge ruled the states had waited too long to challenge Facebook's acquisition in
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:09.140]   2012 and 2014 of Instagram and WhatsApp respectively.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:15.060]   Facebook's been demanding that the FTC's chair, Lena Kahn, recues herself from the case because
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:22.660]   she has in the past written academic and other articles suggesting that a big tech in Facebook
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:24.940]   particularly should be broken up.
[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:29.860]   So there's going to be a lot more court going on and an appeal from the court said she
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:30.860]   should recuse herself.
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:33.380]   No, no, Facebook said she should accuse herself.
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:34.380]   All right.
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:38.980]   I don't know if she, I don't know if that's, I don't know if that's going to happen.
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:45.660]   Facebook is going to limit the ads children can see after revelations that Australian
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:50.300]   alcohol companies have been buying ads for teens.
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:55.380]   Advertisers on Instagram, Facebook and Messenger will no longer be able to market to under 18s
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:56.780]   based on their interests.
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.020]   I hear you like tequila.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:05.460]   What are the interests Facebook will impose more controls on the types of ads and children
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:10.660]   as young as 13 are exposed to on Instagram and other platforms.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:14.460]   They'll stop advertisers marketing to teens under 18 based on their interest.
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:15.460]   They'll will advertise.
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:19.620]   There's only no age, gender and location to target these ads.
[01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:24.020]   So these were targeted at teens who had in some way, shape or form on these platforms
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.620]   signaled their interest in alcohol or whatever.
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:28.940]   Yeah, there was a group in Australia.
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:33.900]   There was a group in Australia called Reset Australia that said we were able to buy ads
[01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:40.380]   targeted at kids aged 13 to 17 based on interests they had including smoking, extreme weight
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:41.380]   loss and gambling.
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.940]   That sounds like kids.
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:43.940]   Oh boy.
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:45.940]   Well, that does sound like kids.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:46.940]   Yeah.
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:50.700]   Do you worry about what the hard heads see on ad wise?
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:52.100]   I mean, not so much.
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.700]   I'm just going to educate them.
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.300]   Yeah, dude.
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.300]   Not so much.
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.700]   I hardly ever worry about them online anymore.
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:22:59.700]   What are you going to do?
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:00.700]   They're holding up now.
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:01.700]   Well, yeah.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:04.700]   He's old enough.
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.700]   He's 18 and he's out of my hair.
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:07.700]   Sure.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:08.700]   Yeah, Mike just got his driver's license.
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:09.700]   Hey, great.
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:10.700]   I'm curious.
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:13.700]   He gets up in the morning and says, "See ya."
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:14.700]   Yes.
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:15.700]   Later.
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:16.700]   Bye bye.
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:21.420]   You have a lot of confidence about this and as a parent of kids who are younger are definitely
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:26.220]   close to becoming teenagers, like where does that confidence come from?
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:27.780]   What did you do early on for your kids?
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:28.780]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:29.780]   You see that confidence now.
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:34.980]   I've been talking to them about this stuff for years since they were little, trying to
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:41.700]   educate them on privacy and awareness of the room, awareness of when you're out and about
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:43.580]   and just to be careful.
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:47.500]   But at the same time, I also wanted them to explore.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:54.380]   The senior college ballad, hard head, he used to be big into Minecraft and just digging
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:57.180]   into stuff and breaking things down.
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:00.260]   He's not doing so much of that now, but he was inquisitive.
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:03.380]   So I had to sort of stay on his case and be like, "Alright, be careful when you're doing
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:04.380]   this research.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.340]   I want people to try to target you."
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:09.340]   Things like that and they learn.
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:13.260]   Oh, but boy, if you're into Minecraft, you live on YouTube with Minecraft videos.
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:14.260]   Right.
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:15.260]   It was YouTube.
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:18.740]   A lot of YouTube videos from Minecraft and there was this other video game he used to
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.780]   play all the time.
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:21.780]   Five nights in Freddy.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:22.780]   Five nights in Freddy's.
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.780]   Five nights in Freddy's.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:27.140]   Yeah, Mike, he would watch a lot of videos about it.
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:31.420]   And a lot of those videos were pretty questionable for his age.
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:33.020]   Yeah, there was a lot of swearing.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:34.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.020]   Because that's a game where you get scares.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.020]   Yeah, there's a lot of scares.
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.020]   A lot of scares.
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:42.820]   So years ago, we were having these talks about, you know, be careful online and be careful
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:43.820]   what to click on.
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:46.780]   Michael will sit watching a, he didn't watch this on his phone with you, which is a very
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.780]   cool YouTube video.
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:48.940]   He's 18 also.
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:53.460]   And it's just like, "God, the worst words coming out of there."
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:54.460]   "What are you watching?
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:55.460]   Oh, this is funny."
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:57.460]   It's comedic.
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:01.420]   And I used to see, and I don't, you know what, that's being a kid.
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:03.940]   We probably were the same.
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:08.860]   We had conversations about those videos and I had to tell them, "Look, you're not old
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:10.100]   enough for that right now."
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:11.100]   Yeah.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:12.100]   So we had to cut some things down.
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:19.020]   And even with our, their older brother back when Grand Theft Auto was a big game and he
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.500]   was, he was just chopping it a bit to get it.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.300]   And I wouldn't get it for a little while.
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:28.740]   And when I finally broke down to get it however many years later, I warned him then, I said,
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:31.220]   "Look, I don't want you thinking, this is reality.
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:32.220]   This is a video game.
[01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:36.500]   You're not going to go out here and start trying to rob people and thinking that's the
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.060]   real world and stuff like that."
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:39.860]   And he got it.
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:45.020]   You know, there was one instance of him being an idiot and I had to take care of it.
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:46.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:47.940]   It's like, no, it's not how life is, bro.
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:50.660]   If he only had one instance, then he'd done a good job.
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:53.060]   I had more than a few myself.
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:55.460]   Yes, I did too.
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:26:01.900]   Jeff Bezos is trying to buy a NASA contract.
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:08.500]   In April, NASA awarded Elon Musk's SpaceX with a $2.89 billion contract to build the
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:14.260]   next crude lunar lander under its HLS human landing systems program.
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:21.180]   Jeff doesn't like that because Blue Origin is a competing civilian space group.
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:22.580]   They didn't give a chance.
[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:27.580]   NASA gave 10-month study contracts to Blue Origin, Dynetics, as well as SpaceX to work
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:28.820]   on lunar landers.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.260]   They lost that contract.
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:37.220]   So now Jeff says, "Hey, I will cover up to $2 billion of your costs if you will give
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:39.660]   us the lunar lander contract."
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:41.500]   Talk about underbidding.
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:45.740]   "Golly, what do you do now?
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:49.860]   Blue Origin will waive all payments up to $2 billion from NASA in the current and next
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:51.780]   two government fiscal years.
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:55.580]   They would also fund their own Pathfinder mission to low-Earth orbit.
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:59.700]   And all they want is a fixed price contract from NASA."
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:03.180]   Why go to the moon?
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:05.780]   Well, that's another question entirely, right?
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:06.780]   Yes, yes.
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:13.540]   This is my earlier, I argued with them to say that this is a lot of potential research
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:17.820]   to help make things better for us as consumers here on Earth and regular people that don't
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:22.340]   have $2 billion to just throw into research.
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:27.220]   But this right here, you tell me, "Yeah, let me get that contract for the moon, essentially
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:28.220]   when..."
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:31.460]   "What are we going to get out of it?"
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.220]   Well, Jeff got afforded.
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:38.540]   This sounds more like almost cussed.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:41.740]   That sounded more like a competition between two...
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:42.740]   It is.
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:43.740]   It's a pissing match.
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:44.740]   It totally is.
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.180]   Yeah, it really is.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:51.660]   And I will forever be glad that Jeff Bezos actually posed for this goofy picture after
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:53.660]   he got off the...
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:55.220]   "The origin."
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:57.180]   He's wearing a cowboy hat and holding his...
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:58.180]   He's in Texas.
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:00.620]   Amelia Earhart's aviation glasses up.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.500]   Yeah, he's no longer CEO of Amazon.
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:03.500]   He can do whatever he wants.
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.980]   He's like, "It's not a risk.
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.980]   It's good.
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:08.980]   He's a cowboy."
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.980]   Yeah, he's a cowboy.
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:11.980]   That's right.
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:12.980]   But it...
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:13.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:20.700]   I mean, the thing is, Musk has actually got a chance of getting his rockets to go to
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:29.180]   the moon because he's building one of those big enough, whereas Bezos has barely achieved
[01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:30.420]   orbit yet, has he?
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:31.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:36.860]   But if you actually look back at Apollo, then that wasn't one company building at all.
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:40.780]   It was a collaboration between lots of companies organized by the government.
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:44.580]   The different bits of the Apollo were built by different companies, and they had to work
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:46.820]   hard to make them fit together.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:49.900]   And that was part of what they learned from it as well.
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:55.020]   Yeah, I'm glad that there's a commercial side of this that we're doing government and
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:57.380]   commercial partnerships.
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:00.900]   It's too bad, though, that as soon as you get commercial entities involved and there's
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:08.260]   this bizarre competition competition, Jeff, take the 2 billion and do something else.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.260]   Do...
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:10.260]   Yes, and not...
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:11.260]   No, I want it.
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:13.340]   Take it away from Elon.
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:19.340]   Last week, we talked about the problem with the Chrome OS update that Brick Jeff Jarvis's
[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:20.340]   laptop.
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:21.580]   He wasn't sure that it was.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:24.580]   I'm sure it was him.
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:26.180]   I'm only saying it because he's not an addict.
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:27.980]   Pretty sure it was.
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:33.820]   But he couldn't log into his laptop for a while after a Google Chrome OS update.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:40.100]   And then the choice at that point was to either power wash it or wait.
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:43.940]   I guess he waited because it started working again after Google pushed another update.
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:44.940]   We now...
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:45.940]   Right.
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:46.940]   Take that long for them to fix.
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:47.940]   Yeah, it didn't take too long for them to fix.
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:53.100]   We now kind of know a little bit better what happened thanks to a Redditor named Eliteist
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.100]   Ferret.
[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:57.060]   Such a cool name.
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:00.620]   He did a little digging in the code.
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:02.380]   I don't know how he got it.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:03.380]   And he found...
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:04.980]   What's his open source?
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:05.980]   Yeah.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:07.220]   Is it open source so he could see?
[01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.940]   Oh, nice.
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:12.980]   And I think you've done a little C++ coding in your time.
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:18.300]   He found that instead of writing ampersand ampersand in this if statement, which is a
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:25.220]   logical and, the coder wrote a single ampersand, which is a bitwise and and has a completely
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:33.060]   different meaning and in fact meant that the login would fail every single time.
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:34.980]   For one of an ampersand.
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:37.860]   Again, where was QA on this?
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:38.860]   Yeah, I wonder.
[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:39.860]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:41.260]   There's always code review, right?
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:42.860]   I mean, there's also lint.
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:48.260]   I mean, I don't understand why this should have been caught right away, it seems.
[01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:50.740]   How does this sneak in, Kevin?
[01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:55.900]   That's a bit they're going to have to do the review of because how does it manage to deploy
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.300]   as they say in the other way?
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:58.300]   Certainly.
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:00.260]   I mean, it's probably true the different channels.
[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:01.620]   Through dev through canary?
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:03.540]   I mean, yeah.
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:11.980]   It feels like almost like, I mean, that it had two ampersands all the way through testing
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:16.660]   and that for some reason, some guy had it open and his, you know, his e-max was open.
[01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:21.180]   He hit a backspace in an opportune moment, didn't notice it.
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:22.180]   Hit the power button.
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:23.180]   Saved it out.
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:24.180]   Saved it out.
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:25.180]   Let's push.
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:27.180]   I mean, how well?
[01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:29.300]   I mean, it feels like that's what happened.
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:30.300]   It's a...
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:31.300]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:33.300]   Why would you change that?
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:36.220]   I mean, you know, it's the kind of time for you make, yes.
[01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:37.380]   Oh, it's easily.
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:38.820]   I mean, I'm sure this happened to everybody.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:39.820]   I mean, this is a...
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:40.820]   It's like equals number.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:41.820]   I'm sure it's happened.
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:45.660]   It's like a single equal versus double equals exactly, right?
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:49.500]   Well, but it's one double, this is triple, but yeah.
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:50.500]   Triple.
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.380]   Single double triple, whatever.
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:55.180]   There's no triple ampersand, is there?
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:57.020]   Heck, you lose me at semicolons.
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:32:00.380]   That's supposed to be there or an R supposed to be there.
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:02.380]   So yeah, I'm done.
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:03.860]   Well, yeah, no.
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:06.380]   Anyway, good catch, elitist ferret.
[01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:09.820]   He found the Fending Ampersand.
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:10.820]   Indeed.
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:11.820]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:14.660]   That's actually pretty cool.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:19.900]   But yeah, I mean, the real question is how did that make it through deployment and we
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:20.900]   did not notice?
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:21.900]   Yeah, they got elitist.
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:22.900]   They got a look at that.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.980]   It died if you did a certain type of reboot and they had never done a reboot.
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:25.980]   Is it one of those kinds of...
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:26.980]   Could be that?
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:27.980]   Yeah.
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:28.980]   I mean, if you...
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:33.180]   It was only if you had a log in and then it would check the password store and if it
[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:36.300]   was in the password store or matched, it would pass you through.
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:42.020]   But because there was no logical and it just never got through.
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:45.740]   Oh, and it maybe they were using some other log in thing.
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:49.300]   Maybe they were using fingerprint or the Android phone pairing.
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:51.740]   But that would have to be a lot of people, I would think.
[01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:52.740]   Maybe everybody...
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:55.780]   You're still asking the same question I ask.
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.180]   Yeah, how did it get through?
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:58.180]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:00.740]   No, the question is still how did it get through QA?
[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:01.740]   Is the right question?
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:02.740]   Here's the question.
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:03.740]   It's in Italian, but the question is...
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:05.780]   What's the password?
[01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.980]   What's the password?
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:08.980]   This was during...
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:09.980]   This was...
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:10.980]   I love it.
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:12.140]   I'm going to write down a little bit.
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:16.140]   This was during the Olympics, the women's volleyball.
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:19.020]   Italian announcer on the Italian network.
[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:21.020]   The asking...
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:23.220]   Yeah, I got to go back a little bit.
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:24.860]   He thought he'd turn off the microphone.
[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:26.940]   He's doing the announcing.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:27.940]   Okay.
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:32.780]   Now he's saying, what's the password to this computer?
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:35.100]   He thinks it's Microsoft.
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:39.100]   The guy's saying what the password is.
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.100]   Boost.03.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:43.980]   Camera people are password and a tropical procedure.
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:45.780]   People put the topolino.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:46.780]   He says, what do you want?
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:48.260]   He called Topo Geejo.
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:51.100]   Or Topolino, why does the password so easy?
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.900]   It's even easier if you watch TV.
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:58.180]   A little embarrassing, but not a major security breach.
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:33:59.940]   You'd have to actually get to the boost.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:00.940]   Yes, exactly.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.540]   Not everybody has long been to that lab at all.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:03.940]   Especially at this year's Olympics.
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:05.380]   Actually, hardly anyone's let in.
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:08.900]   In a way, though, we now know the password scheme for all the computers.
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:09.900]   That's true.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:10.900]   That's true.
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:14.700]   The infamous number number after the word.
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:22.140]   And I learned from listening to this a lovely new Italian saying, La Porca Mazaria, which
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:24.060]   means what the hell?
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.060]   Yes.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.060]   Yes.
[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.060]   La Porca Mazaria.
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:28.060]   Yes.
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:29.060]   Italian sounds so cool.
[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:30.060]   La Porca Mazaria.
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:34.660]   Isn't that a good, it means that miserable pig.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:35.660]   Literally.
[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:36.660]   Literally.
[01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:37.660]   But that's it.
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:38.660]   That's it.
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:39.660]   Literally.
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:42.140]   I learned how to swear in Italian when I was a young man.
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:47.060]   I used to play chess with an Italian international master.
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:50.060]   Every time I did a good move, which was rare against this good guy because he was very
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:51.060]   talented.
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:53.860]   He would, worse swear, it was always an Italian.
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:55.340]   And I said, "What is that?"
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.220]   And he said, "Oh, you don't want to tell me to tell me to tell me to tell me to tell me."
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.580]   That's why I learned all of these.
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:01.580]   I learned all these.
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.500]   And I tried it last year when we were in Italy.
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:04.500]   I said it.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.940]   We were in a traffic jam and I said it.
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:08.140]   And everybody looked at me like I...
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.460]   Like, they insulted the Pope or something.
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:14.660]   It was like that was a bad word I just said.
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:15.660]   You knew it was bad.
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:16.660]   You didn't know it was bad.
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:18.660]   You had to do it with a pig.
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:23.900]   And you always know how to make a scene where we go.
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:27.260]   I'm hoping La Porca Mazaria is not too bad.
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:28.260]   We'll do some research.
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:31.100]   You can look it up before you go through all that around.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:32.100]   It's a good thing.
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:33.100]   It's a good thing.
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:35.820]   You see, it sends us a notice here a little while.
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:43.060]   When you're next Model X or Model X or Model S, your steering wheel is going to look like
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:46.620]   you're flying the Boeing 737 on the way.
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:49.420]   Or maybe that formula won a race car.
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:53.380]   Elon Musk has now confirmed with a simple one-word tweet.
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:54.380]   No.
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:55.380]   That...
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.380]   That loved that.
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:01.540]   No other steering wheel will be offered on new models of the Model S or X. This first
[01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:03.260]   made its appearance on the plaid.
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:07.500]   The problem with the yoke steering wheel is you can't steer hand over hand.
[01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:09.740]   I mean, that's a big problem.
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:11.820]   It's kind of dangerous at low speed.
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:14.900]   This is not the best steering wheel ever.
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:17.380]   Again, how did this get approved?
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:19.380]   How did that get?
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:21.220]   Well, because Elon said, "Oh, that's cool.
[01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:22.220]   We're going to do that."
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:24.220]   You know, like jets.
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:25.220]   You like jets.
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:26.220]   We've been doing the jets.
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:32.460]   The problem is that the Tesla is like every other vehicle has a normal 14 to 1 steering
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:33.460]   ratio.
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:34.460]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:40.020]   So if you were in F1 where a little bit of the steering wheel turns the wheel more, you
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:41.980]   know, a better ratio, that would be okay.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:42.980]   Yep.
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:45.580]   But you still have to turn the wheel like this.
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:46.580]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:49.380]   Anyway, I can't wait to watch somebody turn it in.
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:50.380]   Oh, yes.
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:53.140]   There's an update coming to my head.
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:56.940]   Oh, hey, Jeremy Sue, hey?
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.220]   Did you talk about that last night?
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:36:59.220]   Yeah.
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:02.220]   I mean, you know, there's really not a whole lot to discuss there than the fact that in
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:08.940]   the AOSP commit seemed to out tier Misu as the would be dessert name for Android 13.
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:10.700]   They didn't do a dessert last time, right?
[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:11.700]   Or when?
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:12.700]   They did.
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.460]   They're still doing desserts, but it's behind the scenes desserts.
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:17.260]   It's not, you know, they're not telling everybody that.
[01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:21.260]   Because they don't make the statues in the Google right flex or anything anymore.
[01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:22.260]   Well, was it?
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:23.260]   So it was S.
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:24.260]   Why am I blanking?
[01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:25.260]   What was this?
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:26.660]   Quince tart was Q.
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:27.660]   Q, that was the one.
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:29.660]   Then there was red velvet cake.
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:30.660]   R, Q, R.
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:31.660]   S was snow cone.
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:32.660]   That's what it was.
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:36.380]   See, it's so behind the scenes that it's even hard.
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:37.380]   It's difficult to even remember.
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:41.580]   I had to tell you, I've said to somebody if they're green up, they're real Android fan
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:44.180]   if they can go through all the versions.
[01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:45.180]   Not me.
[01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:46.180]   I can.
[01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:47.180]   I don't know what ABCD.
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:49.180]   There's a Claire.
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:50.180]   Frozen.
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:51.180]   Yup.
[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:52.180]   Froyo.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:53.180]   Froyo.
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:54.180]   Gingerbread.
[01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:55.180]   H.
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:56.180]   Honeycomb.
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:57.180]   Ice cream sandwich.
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:58.180]   J.
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:59.180]   Jellybean.
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:00.180]   K.
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.180]   Kit.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.180]   Lollipop.
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:03.180]   M.
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:04.180]   Marshmallow.
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:05.180]   N.
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:06.180]   K.
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:07.180]   Nugget.
[01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:08.180]   Oh, Oreo.
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:10.420]   Oreo was good because you guys had every week.
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:11.860]   It'd come in on a Wednesday morning.
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:13.940]   The Oreo's left over from all about.
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:14.940]   Different flavors.
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:18.100]   Yes, I have a button Oreo since season was sick.
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:19.100]   Oh, it's Oreo.
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:20.100]   And P.
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:21.100]   What's P?
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:22.100]   It was just pie.
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:23.100]   Pie.
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:24.100]   Pie.
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:25.100]   Yeah, pie.
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:26.100]   Thank you.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.100]   Quince tart.
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:28.100]   Quince tart.
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:29.100]   You should be the host of a show about Android.
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.100]   Right.
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:31.100]   Let me think about that.
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.500]   I'll propose an idea for a show for you.
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.980]   There was no A, right?
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:35.980]   There was no B.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:36.980]   C was the first one, Cupcake.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:37.980]   Cupcake.
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:38.980]   The G one was the cupcake.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:41.420]   Yeah, well, I wonder if A and B had something behind this.
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:42.420]   I wonder.
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:44.420]   Well, yeah, that's probably it.
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:45.420]   Alphabeta and then they're like, wait a minute.
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:47.020]   Instead of these, why don't we do desserts?
[01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:49.060]   Yeah, let's go Cupcake on the next time.
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:53.060]   When we were at Apple on Quicktime, we named our releases After Drinks so that when we launched
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:56.100]   them, we'd have a drink at the party.
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:57.500]   Which was the time we'd have some.
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:58.500]   Yeah, well, tell us.
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:38:59.980]   Were they alphabetical drinks?
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:01.860]   No, no, they were just like drinks.
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:04.620]   We decided it would be a good thing to drink after one of you.
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:09.340]   Like, what had the releases called Black Velvet because we thought that was a good cocktail
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:10.340]   and we had.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:11.340]   Oh, fashions.
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:17.540]   Well, there was then we had a Canadian PM who decided that he would call it Clamato.
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:19.300]   And nobody wanted to work.
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:21.140]   Oh, that's disgusting.
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:22.140]   Oh, no.
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:23.140]   Fired.
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:24.140]   Get out of there.
[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:25.820]   Is there a point here?
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:29.060]   Does anybody remember Clamato?
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:30.260]   Do they still make that?
[01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:31.860]   That was a tomato juice with clam flavor.
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:32.860]   They still do.
[01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:33.860]   You get a drink.
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:34.980]   They still make it special in Canada, yeah.
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:36.500]   They still do.
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:41.140]   It reminds me of, and this is an old story, but I love it, the mystery soda machine of
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:42.140]   Seattle.
[01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:43.140]   What is this?
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:45.900]   Do you remember this?
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:46.900]   I saw this.
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:47.900]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:49.980]   So it's in front of a locksmith.
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:52.180]   It was in front of a locksmith shop in Seattle.
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:58.020]   It was a normal Coke machine except that there were two buttons named Mystery.
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.140]   And then all the buttons were named Mystery.
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:09.340]   And it would dispense mysterious cans of long disappeared or strange international sodas.
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:12.140]   Like maybe Clamato juice might have been in there.
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:14.300]   Oh, man, I'd want to refund.
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:16.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:19.660]   No, because you'd go and you'd press the button just because you want to see there's
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:26.820]   a list on Wikipedia Mountain Dew Whiteout, raspberry flavored Nestee brisk Hawaiian punch,
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:34.260]   a great fan of vanilla cokes, black cherry fresca's, sun kissed cherry limeade.
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:40.580]   The locksmith claims he knew nothing about it, but at one point the machine had to be
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:44.020]   moved for sidewalk repairs and never came back.
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:52.300]   Although there was a sign placed on its Facebook page stating going for a walk need to find
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:55.260]   myself, maybe take a shower even.
[01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:56.260]   Oh, wow.
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:59.060]   I mean, it did look like a dirty vending machine.
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:01.100]   Oh, oh, I think it was old.
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:02.140]   It's kind of beat up.
[01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:03.460]   I plotted it's aware.
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:10.660]   I encourage anyone who has access to a soda machine and wants to play that game to have
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:13.500]   some fun and create some mystery buttons.
[01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:14.900]   We should do that here, John.
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:15.900]   We should have a soda machine.
[01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:18.420]   Kids don't know what soda machines are though.
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:19.420]   What?
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:20.420]   Do you?
[01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:21.420]   I don't see any of these.
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.420]   I see.
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:26.980]   In fact, when we got home from our vacation, we're getting our bags and there's a very
[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:33.180]   modern soda machine that you are expected, I think, to use your watch and phone to pay.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:34.180]   And there was a port.
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:38.900]   I felt so bad for a little old lady standing there and she said, "Can you help me?
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:41.100]   I don't understand how this works."
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:42.100]   Right.
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:44.700]   What prices are anything on the sodas?
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:46.700]   She said, "What's the model of water?"
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:47.700]   It's a fence unit.
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:49.700]   No, it wasn't a mixer.
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:54.340]   It was just like a regular vending machine, although it was one with the arm that goes,
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:57.260]   "But, I just want a bottle of water.
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:58.460]   What do I do?
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:00.420]   How much money do I put in?"
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:01.420]   Oh, boy.
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:05.020]   And I had explained, "Well, you enter the code for the bottle and then it'll tell you
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:06.700]   how much it costs.
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:11.980]   And then if you have a watch or a phone, you tap it, otherwise good luck."
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.060]   The one is fine to fountain.
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:16.260]   Fine to water to the water.
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:17.260]   Wow.
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:18.900]   So, yeah, there's still a round.
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:21.180]   I haven't seen it look like that, though.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:22.180]   Oh, I know.
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:23.180]   That was pretty old.
[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:24.180]   Yes.
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.180]   That was a long time ago.
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.820]   Hey, why don't we play the drums?
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:32.220]   Because I think this would be a good time to do the Google change log.
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:36.140]   The Google change log.
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:42.860]   Some big changes coming along in the Google verse.
[01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:50.780]   This is posted in the privacysandbox.com website, the timeline.
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:52.100]   So this is actually interesting.
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:56.380]   Remember Google said at one point we're going to kill third party cookies and then recently
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:59.780]   said, "Well, let's put that one off."
[01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:07.940]   Yeah, they announced Flock, they have a variety of privacy initiatives.
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:12.100]   But maybe you've been a little confused by the moving targets.
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:16.100]   So now they've posted this.
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:22.060]   So there's discussion testing ready for adoption transition period stage one, transition period
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.060]   stage two.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:26.100]   It goes all the way out to Q3 2023.
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:29.980]   So now you can see where we stand.
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:34.440]   Third party cookies transitioning out of Chrome over a three month period finishing late
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:35.440]   2023.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.440]   See?
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:37.440]   That's the time to look at that.
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:42.060]   Someone should take a screenshot of that and come back in another quarter.
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:43.060]   Yeah.
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:44.060]   See if that screenshot moves.
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:45.940]   Trust, they have a lot of initiatives.
[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:49.820]   Trust tokens, API, Flock, Fledge, Core attribution.
[01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:51.540]   They're doing a lot of stuff.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:55.100]   We had a great, oh man, this was so interesting.
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:44:04.500]   A discussion on security now yesterday about Google's attempt to fix phishing websites,
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:06.260]   to identify them.
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:12.300]   And the problem is they have a database of phishing sites, but they want to let you know,
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:15.260]   you know, you've seen this warning, you get the big red warning that says, "Don't go any
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:19.660]   farther this is fraudulent."
[01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:25.620]   The issue is they want to do this on device and they want to do it.
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:29.620]   So that means they're going to have to do something about, you can't put all the images
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:30.620]   of the website.
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:33.860]   You're going to have some way to fingerprint it.
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:38.420]   And so they came up with a very clever way to fingerprint phishing sites.
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:44.500]   They hash the colors on the page and that hash database is small enough they could actually
[01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:47.980]   transmit it to your to Chrome and Chrome.
[01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:53.740]   And then when you go to a site and the other thing that was fascinating about this post
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:45:00.780]   was, I'll see if I can find it, they described what you needed to do to hash the colors on
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:02.340]   the page in a reasonable amount of time.
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:06.660]   Because if it takes an hour, the guy's going to go on the, so they say, "We can get it
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:08.820]   down out of five seconds."
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:12.900]   We hash the colors on the page, we check and see if it matches the hash of a known phishing
[01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:13.900]   page.
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:14.900]   And that's how they know.
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:15.900]   Nice.
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:18.980]   So I think that's really interesting.
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:24.820]   I was trying to beat the bad guys before they can come up with a strategy to change the
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:25.820]   --
[01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:33.100]   Well, it's an interesting computer science problem because how do you do this fast?
[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:42.740]   This comes out in M92, the title of the piece is "The Fast and the Curious."
[01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:47.420]   And they describe how they'll go through the colors on the page and hash them so that
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:54.540]   it'll give you this deceptive site ahead and how they were able to make it faster and faster.
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:59.740]   It's really, if you're interested in computer science algorithms and solving interesting
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:01.820]   problems, this is a great piece.
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:04.700]   It's in the Chromium blog.
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:10.580]   They say starting with M92, Chrome now executes image-based phishing classification 50 times
[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:16.380]   faster at the 50th percentile, two and a half times faster at the 99th percentile.
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:22.100]   So on average, users will get their classification results after 100 milliseconds, a tenth of
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:24.940]   a second instead of 1.8 seconds.
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:25.940]   So that's good.
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:27.860]   Yeah, you want to know immediately.
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:30.340]   You don't want to spend some time browsing around.
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:31.340]   So good job.
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:35.700]   That's the kind of stuff to me that's really interesting.
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:40.540]   Google Drive will let you now -- this is something they've needed to do for a long time.
[01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:45.060]   People can harass you by sharing documents to your Google Drive, right?
[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:50.500]   Google Drive over the next couple of weeks will let you block other users, say, "Stop
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:54.980]   sharing with me," Lily MacDonald at ink-42.com.
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:59.780]   Oh, such a suspicious place to send an email from.
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.620]   Man, I've had this happen.
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:03.980]   I used to be a problem.
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:07.020]   There's a setting in Google Calendar where people could put calendar events.
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:08.340]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.340]   I do remember that.
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:10.340]   That was terrible.
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:11.340]   Wait a minute.
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:12.340]   What's going on with my calendar?
[01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:18.740]   Time to buy another Instagram product.
[01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:26.100]   So this was announced in May, but it's going to be rolling out over a period of time.
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.100]   So good.
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:29.140]   Good on Google.
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:33.260]   Maybe you saw the Google Drive security update message.
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:34.780]   Yeah, I did.
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:38.860]   A security update will be applied to Drive.
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:42.340]   You might have gotten this in your email.
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:43.340]   This is Ron again.
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:45.220]   Ron Amario writing an ARSE Technica.
[01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:52.620]   He says, "A whole bunch of us got this blasted with this last night, July 27th.
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:56.380]   If you visit drive.google.com, you'll see this message on September 13th.
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:58.860]   The security update will be applied to some of your files.
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:00.900]   You'll even see, "Well, I'm going to see this.
[01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:01.900]   You getting this?"
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:02.900]   I've seen it.
[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:05.100]   Yes, I can pull it up here.
[01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:08.020]   Google's changing the way content sharing works on Drive.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:09.020]   Drive files.
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:10.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.020]   Look at that.
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:12.220]   It's right at the top.
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:13.300]   Have two sharing options.
[01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:14.660]   I should see if...
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:16.060]   Let's go to my drive.
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:17.460]   Let me just see.
[01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:19.260]   See, I don't have a lot of refresh.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:20.260]   See?
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:21.260]   Nope.
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:23.700]   Apparently they're not going to do it to me, but it's rolling out.
[01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:26.580]   You can do it to you though, Andy.
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:28.420]   You need it.
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:31.140]   Zero.
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:35.740]   There's two sharing options, a single person allow list where you share Google Doc with
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:36.740]   specific accounts.
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:37.740]   I use that all the time.
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:38.740]   I do too.
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:39.740]   That's what we do, right?
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:43.900]   A get link option where you get a generated link which you can then paste into a message.
[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:45.380]   I do that a lot too.
[01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:46.380]   I do both.
[01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:48.940]   It's part of being a producer.
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:51.460]   The get link isn't actually private, right?
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:53.900]   If somebody could guess it, it's just an unguessable link.
[01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:55.260]   Yeah, it's just super long.
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:58.060]   Probably not going to be guessed, but I suppose so.
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:01.060]   Turns out, oh, surprise, the links are actually guessable.
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:03.660]   Now I'm going to check that out.
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:12.180]   Now there's probably a tool that someone created or figured out to find the scheme.
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:16.740]   This is an article describing this from veronus.com's security site.
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:25.820]   So Google responds, let's see, by doing this update.
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:30.100]   By the way, this same thing with the YouTube links when you get a -- you can have an unlisted
[01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:31.100]   YouTube.
[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:32.100]   I use that all the time.
[01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:35.700]   I'll put something on YouTube, but I won't list it so that it's quote private, but it's
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:36.700]   not.
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:40.540]   And if it's guessable, it's really not private.
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:45.260]   In 2017, YouTube rolled out an update to the system that generates new unlisted links
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:49.620]   which included security enhancements that make the links harder to discover.
[01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:52.020]   That's what Google is going to do.
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:53.820]   We did it on YouTube in 2017.
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:57.300]   That's presumably what they're going to do and drive to it.
[01:49:57.300 --> 01:50:02.700]   The new link scheme adds a resource key to the end of any shared drive links.
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:07.700]   So it's just another big long hash.
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:09.140]   We took your long hash.
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:10.420]   We doubled the size.
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:13.660]   We replaced it with another even longer hash.
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:15.460]   That's -- oh my gosh.
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:18.020]   Yeah, that's really what they did, right?
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:19.940]   Resource key equals.
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:21.420]   Okay.
[01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:23.420]   Whatever you got to do to make it more secure.
[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:27.260]   Yes, it doesn't matter to me.
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:33.100]   So if you head to update drives in a browser, you'll see a list of your impacted files.
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:36.220]   If you mouse over them, I presume those are files you've shared that way.
[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:40.380]   You'll see a button to remove or apply the security update.
[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:44.580]   And that means after September 13th, that link you shared with people will no longer
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:45.660]   be good.
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:50.020]   You'll have to send it again with the new resource key.
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:51.020]   Interesting.
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:52.020]   All right.
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:53.620]   Apparently, I haven't done that.
[01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:54.780]   Maybe that's why I'm not getting that.
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:55.780]   You must have.
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:56.780]   Yeah.
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:57.780]   I have.
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:02.020]   There's a couple that I just -- oh, my personal drive that -- or just -- it's easier for me
[01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:07.260]   to share it to them with the link versus trying to send a whole file and stuff like that.
[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:08.260]   Yep.
[01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:09.260]   Yep.
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:13.780]   You remember that great technology Google showed off at Google I/O about 18 years ago?
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:14.780]   Doplex?
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:15.780]   How long ago was that?
[01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:16.780]   That was two years ago.
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:17.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:18.780]   It was probably two or three years ago.
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:19.780]   It was three Google I/Os ago.
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:25.060]   Hey, you're not going to be using it for fast checkout.
[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:26.060]   Hi.
[01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:32.820]   Can I help you quickly check out?
[01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:33.820]   And I don't know.
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:36.900]   Are you going to say yes?
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:38.860]   I don't know.
[01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:43.980]   So this is probably working with select sites on the processing --
[01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:47.220]   9-5-Google has a picture of Hot Topic.com.
[01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:48.220]   Oh, okay.
[01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:49.220]   Well, then I'll definitely use it.
[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:53.140]   That's where I get all of my crop tops.
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:56.460]   Oh, Hot Topic actually cool t-shirts in there.
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:57.940]   I give them that.
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:58.940]   Hi.
[01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:00.700]   Can I help you quickly check out?
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:04.660]   And then there'll be a button that says fast checkout.
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:12.260]   You'll have the option to disable it entirely or skip it just for that purchase or do fast
[01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:13.260]   checkout.
[01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:18.820]   You'll have to agree to Google Assistant Chrome and the Google -- it's fast checkout in a
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:19.820]   few taps capability.
[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:23.540]   Then it'll show your contact info, payment method and shipping address.
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:24.540]   Is this it?
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:25.540]   Is this right?
[01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:27.900]   Is this where you want to go?
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:28.900]   And then you say, yeah.
[01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:31.100]   So it's going to walk you through the checkout.
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:32.100]   So it's like -- is that faster?
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:33.740]   Well, yeah, that's what I'm wondering.
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:38.660]   Is it just an auto fill assisted by -- well, assistant?
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:39.900]   And that's kind of what it sounds like.
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:41.140]   Well, you'll be able to turn it off.
[01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:44.940]   Remember when I was telling you about China, looking at us Americans and --
[01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:48.660]   You're too lazy to check a box.
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:51.460]   Confirm your address.
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:52.700]   You want somebody to walk you through it.
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:55.260]   It is that hard for us Americans to do this.
[01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:58.420]   It isn't -- you know, I guess it's more -- Now I'm thinking accessibility.
[01:52:58.420 --> 01:52:59.420]   It's not for us.
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:00.420]   Yeah.
[01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:01.420]   It's for accessibility.
[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:03.380]   It's for people who are confused by the process.
[01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:04.380]   Sure.
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:08.540]   And frankly, it's in Google's interest to make it easier to shop online.
[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:10.540]   New unified backup system.
[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:12.540]   Backup by Google One.
[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:14.340]   I'm a Google One user.
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:16.860]   But you don't need Google One in order -- Oh.
[01:53:16.860 --> 01:53:21.500]   This is one of those situations where Google names something and it makes it seem like
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.740]   it's one thing, but it's actually something else.
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:27.140]   From what 9 to 5 Google says here, you don't have to be a Google One subscriber to benefit
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:28.140]   from this.
[01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:33.700]   They are upgrading the backup system for Android to include a few things.
[01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:34.700]   What is it?
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:35.700]   It's more granular.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:36.700]   MMS, photos and videos.
[01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:37.700]   Oh, how long with?
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:38.700]   Nice.
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:43.900]   So you'll have -- in your backup settings in Android now, is this Android 12 only or
[01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:45.700]   is it going to -- No, I think it's 8 and up.
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:46.700]   Oh, nice.
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:50.900]   And I don't know -- I think they're going to be bringing this into settings.
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:54.420]   I don't know if there's a companion app or how exactly that's going to go, but everybody's
[01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:59.940]   going to have a more comprehensive backup for when you're restoring your phone from
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:01.140]   their cloud backup.
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:05.100]   The one thing that's missing from here, which I still am very curious about, is RCS.
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.900]   I mentioned this last time on the show.
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:09.500]   RCS messages still not backed up by Google.
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:12.900]   Still very hard to back up using other backup apps.
[01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:14.940]   Like I said, that's the problem.
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:15.940]   Right.
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:18.020]   I believe that's the problem.
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:22.260]   But as more and more of these phones, especially here in the US, now we've got all the carriers
[01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:26.300]   dedicating themselves to RCS or Android messages.
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:32.740]   So we're going to have a lot of people communicating via RCS chat here in the US.
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:37.660]   That means more messages in our app that are RCS.
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:39.140]   So how do those get backed up?
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:40.140]   And I don't know.
[01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:41.140]   Because people are going to want those backed up.
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:42.140]   I can't.
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:45.900]   I mean, even if it's encrypted, it's just a blob that's some sort of RCS.
[01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:49.540]   Can't you just take that blob and copy it?
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:52.500]   I wonder what the issue is.
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:53.500]   I have no idea.
[01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:55.340]   You know, the white B.
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:57.780]   Okay, I have a thought.
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:06.380]   The key to that RCS encryption stored on your phone in a secure enclave cannot be copied.
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:08.620]   I don't have access to that.
[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:11.620]   So you could copy a blob that you couldn't decrypt.
[01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:12.620]   Right.
[01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:13.620]   Right.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:14.620]   Does that make sense?
[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:15.620]   Yeah.
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:19.260]   But people are going to want those messages.
[01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:20.260]   Don't encrypt them.
[01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:22.660]   You said you wanted to encrypt them, but no, you don't.
[01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:23.660]   Right.
[01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:24.660]   Yeah, totally.
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:27.860]   You really want to back them up and let us do plex.
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:28.860]   What do you want?
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:30.620]   Tell me what you really want.
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:33.660]   User phones.
[01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:38.500]   YouTube creators can finally apply to test the Stadia crowd play beta.
[01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:42.940]   This is one of the things that they touted with a rollout of Stadia.
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:46.060]   And now it's starting to open up.
[01:55:46.060 --> 01:55:50.500]   Audience participation says Stadia, like you've never seen it before.
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:54.020]   Crowd play allows your friends and viewers to jump into the game and play alongside as
[01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:55.020]   you stream.
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:58.460]   So you can give them a link that is not just a link to your video, but a link to where
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:02.820]   you are in the game and they can join your server and play.
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:03.820]   So cool.
[01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:04.820]   That is a really neat feature.
[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:07.300]   I remember when they announced this, I thought, oh, that's really interesting.
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:08.300]   Yes.
[01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:10.300]   But here we are a couple of years later, at least we're seeing it.
[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:15.700]   At least it isn't that removing the fence from photos.
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:24.380]   So you do have to apply and you obviously have to have a Stadia account and a Google
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:26.020]   YouTube account.
[01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:28.900]   And they ask you to list which games you'd be interested in.
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:33.260]   So I think it sounds like you have to have cooperation of the game platform.
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:34.260]   Right.
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:36.020]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:43.980]   Android Studio Arctic Fox is now available with Wear OS pairing and Jetpack Compose.
[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:45.460]   Would you explain this to me?
[01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:46.900]   That's a dev talk, right?
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:48.740]   Yeah, this is all developers.
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:51.820]   Android Studio, the next major version, Arctic Fox.
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:53.860]   I couldn't tell you a whole lot about it personally.
[01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:59.260]   I'm not a developer, but I'm assuming this means, at least I'm hoping this means kind
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:00.740]   of some of the new Wear OS stuff.
[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:02.500]   That's the IDE for Android, right?
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:04.980]   It's one of the IDs.
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:07.940]   And I'm not a fan.
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:08.940]   I'm not a big IntelliJ.
[01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:11.620]   Fan is based on IntelliJ.
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:16.900]   But I think it's probably widely used in the Android developer community.
[01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:21.100]   And yeah, of course, if you're going to have a new Wear OS, you've got to have an emulator.
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:22.100]   Yeah.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:26.140]   So that's one of the things that comes with Android Studio.
[01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:27.460]   I've been playing a little bit with Flutter.
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:28.860]   I'm actually very interested.
[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:30.900]   Have you tried Flutter at all, Kevin?
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:33.180]   Oh, you're muted.
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:35.180]   I wonder we haven't heard a thing from him.
[01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:36.180]   Oh.
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:37.820]   Oh, there you go.
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:41.140]   Ah, well, I thought you were just ignoring me.
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:43.180]   I'm so sorry.
[01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.860]   I'm so sorry.
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:47.620]   I did very well, cough to let the dogs out a few minutes ago.
[01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:48.900]   Ah, that's probably what it was.
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.180]   We heard a lot of barking and we muted you.
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:53.180]   Yeah.
[01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:56.140]   I haven't played with Flutter yet.
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:58:02.020]   Dark Plus Flutter is their cross platform for Android and iOS development tool.
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:05.180]   And also, let's actually develop web apps as well.
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:06.180]   Yeah.
[01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:07.180]   It's pretty--
[01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:09.740]   It's like platform things, but I haven't played good yet.
[01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:11.380]   I'm impressed.
[01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:15.580]   You know, it's a framework and it's very detailed.
[01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:19.740]   I haven't gotten deep into it, but it seems pretty darn good.
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:24.140]   It even has the capability of putting in native widgets for iOS or Android.
[01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:27.220]   So all your iOS apps don't look like material design apps.
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:30.580]   This object-oriented stuff all looks the same to me, sir.
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:31.340]   It is.
[01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:32.340]   It just looks the same.
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:33.340]   It does.
[01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:34.340]   It's funny.
[01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:40.420]   I mentioned this on the show, but I've been doing functional programming for so long that
[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:45.420]   when I'm looking at Flutter and I see that you're assigning a value to a variable and
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:49.140]   then changing it, I'm going, "You can't do that."
[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:50.540]   That's wrong.
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:53.940]   It's so funny how you get in your head that--
[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:55.180]   It's so old school, yeah, yeah.
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:56.180]   Oh my god.
[01:58:56.180 --> 01:58:59.380]   They're changing the value of that variable.
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:00.940]   What are we going to do?
[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:03.660]   I'll get over it.
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:07.700]   And finally-- Oh, this is related.
[01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:08.700]   This is Jetpack Compose.
[01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:11.460]   Yeah, this is part of Jetpack Compose, Ham.
[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:12.460]   Okay.
[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:14.300]   So this is a UI-building tool.
[01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:16.980]   This is actually important too.
[01:59:16.980 --> 01:59:20.740]   If you're going to-- Nowadays, when you're designing software, really, a lot of it is
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:23.820]   about UI and all these widgets.
[01:59:23.820 --> 01:59:28.780]   This makes it much easier to design and interface.
[01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:29.780]   Yeah.
[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:32.060]   At least that's what hooks people in.
[01:59:32.060 --> 01:59:37.940]   With the exception of Snapchat, Snapchat did a really good job of keeping people interested
[01:59:37.940 --> 01:59:43.580]   in their app even though their UI is by far one of the worst I've ever seen in my life.
[01:59:43.580 --> 01:59:44.580]   It's intentional.
[01:59:44.580 --> 01:59:46.140]   I'm giving-- I know you know.
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:47.140]   Exactly.
[01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:51.940]   It's totally intentional because then the people who know are in the end.
[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:52.940]   Right.
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:56.860]   And they get to be kind of, "Hey, they're late.
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.100]   How do you send this?"
[01:59:58.100 --> 01:59:59.740]   And they get to say, "Oh, let me show you."
[01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:00.740]   And then you're in the club.
[02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:10.860]   And I totally convinced that Evan Spiegel's idea for growth hacking make it hard, impenetrable,
[02:00:10.860 --> 02:00:12.220]   but then teenagers will share it.
[02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:13.220]   And it's just brilliant.
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:14.220]   I think it's brilliant.
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:15.220]   Keep those old folks out.
[02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:16.860]   I may be giving them too much credit.
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:20.420]   It might just be a sucky UI.
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:23.100]   So Jetpack Compose 1.0 is out.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:24.820]   It's official.
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:29.980]   And you can start using it in your Arctic Fox Android Studio.
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:35.220]   And that's the Hougall Change Log.
[02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:39.860]   Let's see.
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:43.420]   Anything else to talk about?
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:44.420]   Jason, I'm sorry.
[02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:47.260]   I just dumped a whole bunch of articles on you this morning.
[02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:51.340]   Jason has to try to whip them into some sort of sense.
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:52.340]   This is nothing.
[02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:53.340]   This is nothing new, Leo.
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:54.340]   This is how it goes.
[02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:55.340]   I was used to it.
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:58.660]   This is what I based my schedule around this.
[02:00:58.660 --> 02:00:59.660]   It's all good.
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:01.460]   I come in and try to figure out what the hell I did.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:03.420]   This is Wednesday.
[02:01:03.420 --> 02:01:05.900]   Twitter is-- I'm sad, actually.
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:07.380]   It's hired away.
[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:11.620]   The team behind it-- I thought a really cool news app, the idea was we will give you five
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:12.620]   stories.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:13.620]   It's all you need.
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:16.700]   It was called Brief.
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:20.580]   And now they've added to their portfolio.
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:22.660]   They bought Nuzzle and killed it.
[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:23.900]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:24.900]   Brief.
[02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:25.900]   I still miss Nuzzle.
[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:26.900]   I saw Nuzzle was great.
[02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:27.900]   I like Brief.
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:28.900]   Yeah.
[02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:31.340]   So I'm a little sad.
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:35.900]   TechCrunch is calling this an Aqua hire, which is usually bad news.
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:36.900]   There weren't very many of them.
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:40.660]   The startup Brief was from former Google engineers.
[02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:45.580]   It was a subscription-based news summary app that some have likened to the old fashioned
[02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:48.380]   newspaper where you'll actually get to the end.
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:49.380]   Unlike the internet.
[02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:52.900]   You can actually get to the end of today's news stories.
[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:54.460]   I liked Brief a lot.
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:57.980]   So I hope Twitter does something good with it.
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:01:59.820]   They are piloting a shopping section.
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:01.980]   I haven't seen it yet for brands.
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:07.380]   If you're using Twitter on iOS, you might see the new Shop module.
[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:10.780]   This is just one more way Twitter is trying to figure out, how the hell do we make money
[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:11.780]   on this thing?
[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:15.540]   The nice thing that Twitter is doing with this stuff in the app, which means I can ignore
[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:17.300]   them because I use the web version.
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:18.300]   Right.
[02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:25.100]   They show them how they get canned and then I don't know if they have to worry about them.
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:27.380]   They are showing some good revenue growth.
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:30.700]   So maybe Twitter has figured it out.
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:36.220]   Here's a disappointing one and I'm sure you'll, Kevin, be as disappointed as I am.
[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:42.860]   Twitter revealed how many people use two factor on Twitter and it's a stunningly low
[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:47.500]   2.3%.
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:51.820]   It's an increase of 9% over last year.
[02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:58.300]   Of the people who use two factor of which, again, it's only 2.3%.
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:02:59.580]   Use two factor, folks.
[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:00.860]   Please protect your Twitter.
[02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:01.860]   Protect everything.
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:02.860]   It's too much.
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:03.860]   It's too much.
[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:05.300]   I do, but that's too much for normal.
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:06.300]   It's too much for people.
[02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:07.300]   Yeah.
[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:12.180]   They don't make the connection of what the true value proposition is about time that they
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:16.020]   spend because it is inconvenient.
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:21.180]   It takes dedication to get beyond the inconvenience and get to a point where it's just like second
[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:22.180]   nature.
[02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:29.660]   Of the 23 people in the thousand on Twitter that use two factor, 80%, which is what is
[02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:30.660]   that?
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:34.420]   That's like 18 or 19 of them use SMS, which is insecure.
[02:03:34.420 --> 02:03:35.420]   Even worse.
[02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:36.420]   Yeah.
[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:37.420]   That's no good.
[02:03:37.420 --> 02:03:38.420]   Wait a minute.
[02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:39.420]   I don't understand this.
[02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:40.420]   Oh, I guess.
[02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:42.980]   Oh, you can have more than one way of doing it enabled.
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:44.260]   So 80% of SMS enabled.
[02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:46.380]   I did disable SMS.
[02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:50.180]   That was only recently added to Twitter because after Jack Dorsey got hacked, they disabled
[02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:51.180]   SMS.
[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:52.180]   Yeah, they fixed it.
[02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:53.180]   Right.
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:54.180]   So they have a feature.
[02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:55.180]   They have a model.
[02:03:55.180 --> 02:03:56.180]   Well, you had to enable SMS first.
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:57.180]   We could use the other ones.
[02:03:57.180 --> 02:03:58.180]   Yeah.
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:03:59.420]   And then they now let you turn it off.
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:03.540]   But for a while, you couldn't for ages, you had to have SMS.
[02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:05.580]   Now you can just use an authentication app.
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:08.700]   About a third of users do that.
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:13.340]   And only 0.5% use a security key.
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:15.340]   So we use a password manager.
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:16.340]   That's right.
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:20.220]   And every now and then, someone in the family needs the Amazon password.
[02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:24.140]   And yeah, just tell them, go on the last pass and boom, do your thing.
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:26.980]   And then they get that, oh, I need the one time password.
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:27.980]   Yeah.
[02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:29.500]   And I say, yeah, that's on purpose.
[02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:30.500]   Yeah.
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:32.260]   You can't get good for you.
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:33.260]   Here's the code.
[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:35.060]   Because I have to confess there are a couple of accounts.
[02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:37.980]   I turn it off so that Lisa and I can share an account.
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:41.580]   She doesn't have to call me and say, what's the authenticator?
[02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:43.300]   I have to solve that.
[02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:45.500]   There should be a way to family share authentication.
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:46.660]   I could, actually.
[02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:47.660]   If you probably can.
[02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:49.900]   When you create it, you both need to take a picture of it or something.
[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:50.900]   Right.
[02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:51.900]   Yeah.
[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:52.900]   You probably can.
[02:04:52.900 --> 02:04:56.580]   But I like this, that little bit of security and control right there.
[02:04:56.580 --> 02:05:00.180]   Especially when you deal with credit cards and stuff.
[02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:01.740]   Absolutely.
[02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:04.140]   Absolutely.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:07.500]   It's funny, there's so many forces trying to make you be insecure.
[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:13.220]   Like the fact that you have to enter the password on a TV using a remote that was just
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:15.260]   trying to get the blowers.
[02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:16.260]   Yes.
[02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:17.260]   Yes.
[02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:21.420]   So my Amazon password is shorter than it should be because I got tired of this.
[02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:22.420]   Yeah.
[02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:23.420]   Oh, I got to go again.
[02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:24.420]   Yeah.
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:26.660]   Five minutes of maneuvering with a remote.
[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:27.660]   All right.
[02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:29.660]   Prepare yourself, fellas.
[02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:35.620]   We are going to go to the picks of the week in just a little bit.
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:37.060]   Once again, Jeff has the week off.
[02:05:37.060 --> 02:05:38.060]   He's traveling.
[02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:39.220]   Stacey, a little under the weather.
[02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:40.460]   She took the week off.
[02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:41.980]   Jason Howells here.
[02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:44.020]   That Pruitt didn't get sick.
[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:45.020]   Thank you, sir.
[02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:48.860]   And thrilled to have, of course, as always Kevin Marks.
[02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:49.860]   Join us.
[02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:50.860]   Good panel today.
[02:05:50.860 --> 02:05:51.860]   It's really fun.
[02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:52.860]   Yeah.
[02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:53.860]   It's a bit nice.
[02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:54.860]   All three of you.
[02:05:54.860 --> 02:05:58.660]   I hope you enjoy what we do here on all of our shows, not just Twig, but all of our shows.
[02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:03.460]   And I invite you, if you want to show your appreciation, support it, help us grow, help
[02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:04.700]   us do new things.
[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:06.940]   To join Club Twit.
[02:06:06.940 --> 02:06:14.460]   Club Twit is a mere $7 a month, less than a couple of Starbucks.
[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:15.620]   Actually depends if what you get.
[02:06:15.620 --> 02:06:20.060]   It's less than a double calf, half calf, frappuccino with a twist.
[02:06:20.060 --> 02:06:21.060]   And what do you get?
[02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:24.500]   You get Twit Plus Feed, which is stuff that doesn't normally make it to the show.
[02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:28.300]   I have a feeling the pre-show today will be a Twit Plus feed.
[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:29.900]   We had some fun.
[02:06:29.900 --> 02:06:34.740]   You also get access to our Discord, which is a great way to chat and participate with
[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:36.740]   all over.
[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:37.740]   I'm fun.
[02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:42.580]   Cooney, I think the thing that's cool about the Discord is it's such a great community
[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:43.580]   of people.
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:44.580]   It is.
[02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:48.020]   And as a result, the conversation is just fantastic.
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:49.940]   They're so fast with their animated GIFs.
[02:06:49.940 --> 02:06:51.500]   They love the animated GIFs.
[02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:53.260]   They're pretty prolific.
[02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:54.260]   Yep.
[02:06:54.260 --> 02:06:57.540]   And you also get, and some people will say this is the most valuable thing.
[02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:58.540]   Some people won't.
[02:06:58.540 --> 02:07:03.500]   A ad-free version of all of our shows, both audio and video, with a feed that's just yours,
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:04.980]   all yours.
[02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:09.660]   We accidentally left an ad in on Sunday.
[02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:12.420]   I mean, it's bound to happen once.
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:13.580]   I was, yeah.
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:15.740]   I mean, no problem.
[02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:16.740]   Yeah.
[02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:19.740]   But I was so pleased to see a couple of people said, oh, it's so great to hear it.
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:21.700]   It's like all days.
[02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:22.700]   It's like all days.
[02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:25.460]   Actually, I think I'm gonna be able to listen to the ads.
[02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:26.460]   And I've read it.
[02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:27.460]   And I've read it.
[02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:29.020]   Anyway, Club Twit is a lot of fun.
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:32.900]   I invite you to join it really is a, I think it's a great thing.
[02:07:32.900 --> 02:07:34.500]   It sure does help us.
[02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:37.500]   It's really made a big difference during COVID.
[02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:41.060]   twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:07:41.060 --> 02:07:43.940]   And thank you so much for your support.
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:45.380]   Are you ready to do some pics of the week?
[02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:46.380]   Let's start with you, Jason.
[02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:48.340]   You never get to do a pic of the week on the show.
[02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:50.980]   You're sitting there watching thinking, why don't they miss?
[02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:54.260]   Well, if I had a pic of the week, this is what I would do.
[02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:57.900]   Meanwhile, this was one of those weeks where I was like, what am I gonna do with my pic?
[02:07:57.900 --> 02:07:58.900]   I know.
[02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:00.900]   I come very easy to me.
[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:03.900]   So I'm going with something that is just kind of top of mind.
[02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:08.380]   I did talk about this a little bit last night at all about Android, but I've kind of enjoyed
[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:10.100]   this because I never really thought about.
[02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:11.420]   So I have YouTube music.
[02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:17.300]   I was gone for about a week and a half traveling through Oregon, did a road trip through some
[02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:18.900]   places in Oregon, went camping.
[02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:23.060]   And I knew I was gonna be on to this campground that had no internet.
[02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:26.420]   I was pretty certain that it wouldn't have any internet connectivity.
[02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:32.340]   But we like to listen to music and I didn't want to spend all night creating a curated
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:35.860]   playlist on my YouTube music account.
[02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:38.740]   And I don't know why it never occurred to me as probably something that's occurred to
[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:42.980]   everybody except for me up until this trip.
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:48.060]   But in YouTube music, you have a Your Likes playlist, which is basically any songs that
[02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:51.540]   over the years you've possibly given a thumbs up to.
[02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:54.500]   It just throws those all into a single playlist.
[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:57.660]   And I marked that playlist as a download.
[02:08:57.660 --> 02:09:00.820]   So download this playlist to the device.
[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:03.980]   It was somewhere around 650 songs over the years.
[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:06.580]   I've liked 650 songs apparently.
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:08.740]   So it takes up a little bit of space.
[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:14.740]   But it was actually a really awesome experience because I never knew that it existed first
[02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:15.740]   of all.
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:19.580]   And once I started actually listening to this playlist, it's like I got to rediscover all
[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:24.140]   this music that over the past 10 years I've liked in one way or another.
[02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:26.620]   And then forgotten about.
[02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:31.220]   And it's just been a really cool experience like getting to reminding myself of this music
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:32.460]   that I've kind of been missing.
[02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:33.700]   I was like, oh yeah, that's right.
[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:34.700]   That is a great song.
[02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:39.820]   I look at this and I think it's all over the place where the hell had my YouTube account.
[02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:43.900]   So do you have your YouTube music account set up to also?
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:45.740]   You also don't have very many likes there.
[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:51.980]   But to import in likes from YouTube proper because there is a setting where you can shut
[02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:52.980]   that off.
[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:53.980]   Oh, shut that off.
[02:09:53.980 --> 02:10:01.300]   You can deactivate that because if you like anything that's potentially even remotely
[02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:04.420]   music related on YouTube proper.
[02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:05.420]   It will then add it to the list.
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:06.420]   It will then bring it in.
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:08.220]   You end up with the weirdest stuff as a whole.
[02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:13.260]   I have both the short and the long version of the sugar hill gang rappers delight.
[02:10:13.260 --> 02:10:14.260]   Beautiful.
[02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:15.260]   Beautiful.
[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:16.260]   What the hell?
[02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:17.260]   All right.
[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:19.500]   I never even heard of some of this.
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:21.500]   Bill Biv Devos do me.
[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:22.500]   Do me.
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:23.500]   That's a classic 90s.
[02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:30.380]   I must have been either listening to it and fell asleep and hit the like button.
[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:31.980]   Or I don't know what.
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:32.980]   Yeah, who knows?
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:35.220]   It's just a weird collection.
[02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:40.580]   Although I want to thank you because this was a song that I liked years ago and I could
[02:10:40.580 --> 02:10:41.580]   not remember.
[02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:47.260]   I've been, Lisa has been saying, well, you know, it's African electronic music.
[02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:51.660]   I don't think Francis, a baby is going to go after me for this.
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:54.700]   I've been for the life of me trying to remember this song.
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:55.700]   Oh, wow.
[02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:58.140]   You just did me a real solid.
[02:10:58.140 --> 02:10:59.140]   There you go.
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:00.140]   There you go.
[02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:01.140]   Yeah.
[02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:02.140]   Well, you know, keep in mind when you're seeing here.
[02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:04.540]   I'm going to get to know Bill Biv Devos.
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:05.540]   Bill Biv Devos.
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:06.540]   Bill Biv Devos.
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:07.540]   Bill Biv Devos.
[02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:10.060]   My name is Bill Biv Devos.
[02:11:10.060 --> 02:11:16.380]   All this information came from Google Play music prior to YouTube music.
[02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:19.180]   So it's probably about 10 years old, potentially.
[02:11:19.180 --> 02:11:20.180]   Oh, yeah.
[02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:21.180]   I didn't have YouTube music at the time.
[02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:24.100]   Yeah, but I have to at some point, I really have to cut back.
[02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:26.660]   I have subscriptions for all of them.
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:28.620]   And I rarely use YouTube music.
[02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:33.660]   But you know, what I do want is the YouTube premium and the music comes with that.
[02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:35.980]   It's hard to have that and then go away.
[02:11:35.980 --> 02:11:38.180]   I don't want to ever see an ad on YouTube ever again.
[02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:39.180]   No, neither do I.
[02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:40.180]   Yeah.
[02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:41.180]   That's the premium.
[02:11:41.180 --> 02:11:44.780]   We tried Spotify when they forced everyone into YouTube music.
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:45.780]   I was like, no, that's it.
[02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:46.780]   I'm done.
[02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:47.780]   Let's just do Spotify.
[02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:48.780]   Everybody's on Spotify.
[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:53.420]   And A, there was the ads on YouTube thing.
[02:11:53.420 --> 02:11:57.580]   You know, basically when I told YouTube music that I was done, they gave me 30 days.
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:59.820]   You know, they gave you 30 days to change your mind.
[02:11:59.820 --> 02:12:05.180]   So I was really happy to have that because A, the thought of not of having YouTube with
[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:08.100]   ads at a certain point, I was like, well, you know what, that's worth it because I use
[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:09.100]   YouTube a lot.
[02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:10.740]   Our family uses YouTube a lot.
[02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:12.220]   That's worth it.
[02:12:12.220 --> 02:12:16.020]   And B, what was so annoying for me and I've talked about it plenty of times and all about
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:20.020]   Android is that we've got Google homes all throughout our house.
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:23.780]   And we've got, you know, our kids who want to listen to music and everything like that.
[02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:26.020]   There was no easy way with Spotify.
[02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:28.340]   And I tried everything.
[02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:32.420]   To make it so that they could listen to what they want in one room and I like to listen
[02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:34.420]   to what I want in another room without it getting interrupted.
[02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:38.020]   We had a Spotify family account and it still did it.
[02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:40.020]   And at the end of the day, we were like, you know what?
[02:12:40.020 --> 02:12:41.020]   That's a bug, right?
[02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:42.020]   What's that?
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:43.020]   It's got to be a bug.
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:44.020]   I don't know.
[02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:45.020]   Some people say they can get it to work.
[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:48.620]   And at the end of the day, Spotify only allowed you to have one, one, one.
[02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:49.620]   Maybe.
[02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:50.620]   I don't know.
[02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:51.620]   It's a dream at a time.
[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:53.520]   Because I have Spotify family.
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:57.820]   I have Spotify family because I opted not to go with Google YouTube music.
[02:12:57.820 --> 02:12:58.820]   Yeah.
[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:03.980]   And on my phone, I'll see notifications of Jake listening to something in his room versus
[02:13:03.980 --> 02:13:07.740]   me listening to a podcast on one of Milo's speakers or whatever.
[02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:08.740]   Yeah.
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:10.740]   Are you voice, is everybody voice activating these things?
[02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:11.740]   Yeah.
[02:13:11.740 --> 02:13:12.740]   And it does.
[02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:13.740]   I don't know what the difference is.
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:16.180]   All I know is I try, I wrestled with it and wrestled with it.
[02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:19.020]   And it kept being just like this contentious thing in the house.
[02:13:19.020 --> 02:13:21.940]   Like, ah, you interrupted my music again or whatever.
[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:22.940]   Yeah.
[02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:24.660]   So finally I was like, you know what doesn't do that?
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:25.660]   YouTube music.
[02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:26.660]   So I'm going to go back to YouTube.
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:27.660]   Yeah.
[02:13:27.660 --> 02:13:28.660]   It makes sense.
[02:13:28.660 --> 02:13:29.660]   It just made sense.
[02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:33.220]   I still have YouTube premium because I didn't want to see the ads because I watched, as I've
[02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:35.820]   said before, so much stuff on YouTube.
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:36.820]   And you see somebody ads.
[02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:38.300]   And his words unwatchable.
[02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:43.340]   And every time the stupid credit card needs to be updated or whatever, I hear about it.
[02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:46.340]   And you can, because apparently everybody else in the house watches.
[02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:47.340]   At least that.
[02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:48.340]   YouTube as much as I do.
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:54.020]   The thing that I resent, and as somebody in the chatroom saying this, I pay an ungodly
[02:13:54.020 --> 02:13:55.860]   amount for YouTube TV.
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:56.860]   Yeah.
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:58.380]   Could you please give me ad for YouTube?
[02:13:58.380 --> 02:13:59.380]   I agree on that.
[02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:00.380]   No.
[02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:01.540]   With that, that really makes a lot of sense.
[02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:02.540]   But not.
[02:14:02.540 --> 02:14:03.540]   Yeah.
[02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:04.540]   So 65 bucks.
[02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:09.700]   I do have to say my pick of the week is at least for the Olympics upgrade if you have
[02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:15.300]   YouTube TV to 4K, it's going to be down the right of year if it's going to be 20 bucks
[02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:16.300]   a month.
[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:18.740]   On top of 65, that's insane.
[02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:19.740]   Wow.
[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:24.140]   But for now, you get a one month free trial and the first year is only 10 bucks a month,
[02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:25.460]   but at least do it for the Olympics.
[02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:31.980]   Because I have to say 4K HDR on a lot of this stuff is fantastic.
[02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:35.380]   And I, the DVR for the Olympics is great.
[02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:37.140]   You basically, I'm recording everything.
[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:38.140]   Yeah.
[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:41.500]   So it's really easy to add stuff.
[02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:46.260]   And I just, so it's really helped us because the, the other thing is the recordings, if
[02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:51.260]   you say record all the Olympics, it's getting it from every NBC entity and we'll some, and
[02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:53.460]   we'll have the earliest play.
[02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:57.500]   So in sometimes they're taped to laying for prime time, but you'll be able to see this
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:01.100]   earlier because it was played on, you know, NBC.
[02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:02.100]   All right.
[02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:06.180]   4K to in the middle of the night.
[02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:07.540]   And so that's a really nice.
[02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:11.500]   So at least for the Olympics, if you're watching the Olympics and your YouTube TV subscriber,
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:14.220]   it is worth, you get a free month turning that on.
[02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:17.060]   And I have to say they, that looks good on my 4K TV.
[02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:18.060]   Nice.
[02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:22.380]   So I know a lot of it is upscale 1080 or some of it is down.
[02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:26.460]   Some of it is shot in a K down scaled to 1080 for the transmission.
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:28.980]   Then be back up to 4K.
[02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:34.020]   It's we got a long way to come, but, but, but it does look, I think a lot better, especially
[02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:35.100]   on YouTube TV.
[02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:38.420]   And you know what? They're smart because I think I'm going to get end up being hooked.
[02:15:38.420 --> 02:15:39.420]   Yeah.
[02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:41.460]   Watching 4K of everything else.
[02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:42.460]   That sharp.
[02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:49.340]   Not everything is 4K, but because of streaming and because of the imminent ATSE 3.0, I think
[02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:53.020]   a lot of even local news and stuff is going to upgrade to 4K.
[02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:55.620]   And yeah, once you get used to that, you don't want to go back.
[02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:56.620]   It's hard to go back.
[02:15:56.620 --> 02:15:57.620]   I want to go back.
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:15:58.620]   Yeah.
[02:15:58.620 --> 02:15:59.620]   Yeah.
[02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:04.940]   So, let's do Kevin Marks next for his pick of the week.
[02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:08.780]   Well, you made me think of a couple of things that I mean, the YouTube music is something
[02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:11.420]   I found, I actually found was good from-
[02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:15.380]   Oh, look at the playlists it makes. They're not bad, are they?
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:16.380]   They're not bad.
[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:19.660]   Yeah, but also the point is you can play stuff that's on YouTube that isn't, isn't label
[02:16:19.660 --> 02:16:20.660]   stuff.
[02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:21.660]   Right.
[02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:22.660]   Which is, which is also a great thing.
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:26.900]   So I've got one of my links is, it's a link to a blog spot blog, which is, which is one
[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:28.700]   of the things I think to link to these dates.
[02:16:28.700 --> 02:16:31.900]   It's a list of all the, of all the John Peel sessions that are on YouTube.
[02:16:31.900 --> 02:16:33.780]   Oh, no kidding. Look at this.
[02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:34.780]   Oh, cool.
[02:16:34.780 --> 02:16:35.780]   So cool.
[02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:36.980]   You don't know who John Peel is.
[02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:42.700]   John Peel was a DJ in the UK who did the late night show on Radio One, and he would
[02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:47.060]   get bands into do recordings before they were found this time.
[02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:51.820]   And so what you get is bands you've heard of and bands you haven't heard of as well,
[02:16:51.820 --> 02:16:54.740]   but what you get is early live versions of their songs, but you probably shouldn't play
[02:16:54.740 --> 02:16:56.740]   them because you know, you're going to get-
[02:16:56.740 --> 02:16:57.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:57.740 --> 02:16:58.740]   Shut down.
[02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:00.100]   But you can play them at home.
[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:01.100]   We can play them at home.
[02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:02.780]   And also they, and they, they YouTube-
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:05.620]   Is it a radio show or is it just the songs?
[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:06.620]   It's a radio show.
[02:17:06.620 --> 02:17:10.980]   So it is just the songs, but they're on YouTube and then you can thumbs them up and
[02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:11.980]   they're going to-
[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:13.540]   Oh, look at all this.
[02:17:13.540 --> 02:17:20.380]   But it is, you know, it is like 30 years or so of recordings of bands just as, just
[02:17:20.380 --> 02:17:23.460]   around, they were becoming famous and some of them would come back and do sets later.
[02:17:23.460 --> 02:17:24.460]   Wow.
[02:17:24.460 --> 02:17:28.780]   So it's often a version of a song that is a classic song, but it's a live version they've
[02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:29.980]   done in the studio at the BBC.
[02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:30.980]   Yeah.
[02:17:30.980 --> 02:17:36.420]   So it's not like listening to the live songs that you get on YouTube where it's a recording,
[02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:40.820]   a scrappy recording from a live gig.
[02:17:40.820 --> 02:17:45.260]   These are actually sort of recorded in a BBC studio by BBC Engineers, but the band playing
[02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:46.260]   that.
[02:17:46.260 --> 02:17:48.180]   So they're often very interesting versions of this.
[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:50.860]   And you could play these on your YouTube music.
[02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:51.860]   Yeah.
[02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:58.660]   Do you, how do you, if you're doing it through the YouTube voice, would you request Peel Session?
[02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:03.980]   If you just search for Peel Sessions, you tend to find, you tend to find, that's the
[02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:04.980]   other tip.
[02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:09.980]   If you just search Peel Session in a band name, if they were all like, if they should up in
[02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:11.620]   the UK ever, then-
[02:18:11.620 --> 02:18:13.060]   This is a great link.
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:14.060]   Thank you for sharing this.
[02:18:14.060 --> 02:18:15.460]   Yeah, this is a golden line.
[02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:16.460]   Wow.
[02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:17.980]   This is just like deep, deep cut stuff.
[02:18:17.980 --> 02:18:20.500]   Yeah, but a lot of bands, everybody will know.
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:25.660]   I mean, there's some really, you know, if you're an echo in the buddy, buddy man fan from
[02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:29.820]   19, you know, whatever, 85, actually there is no echo.
[02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:35.020]   Oh, there is from 1979, 1980, 1982, 1983.
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:36.020]   This is great.
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:37.820]   This is like gold.
[02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:38.820]   Wow.
[02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:39.820]   Yeah.
[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:43.300]   So this, basically, he had the late night show on Radio 1 and he would break bands.
[02:18:43.300 --> 02:18:45.100]   They send him in tapes.
[02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:47.980]   And then he'd, then he'd bring some of these record sessions.
[02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:49.820]   So this goes back to the '60s.
[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:50.820]   I love it.
[02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:51.820]   Yeah.
[02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:52.820]   Oh my God.
[02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:53.820]   Oh, this is like-
[02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:54.820]   This is like amazing.
[02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:56.100]   Early Pink Floyd playing live.
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:58.140]   I would love to hear interviews too, though.
[02:18:58.140 --> 02:19:01.020]   I wish, you know, it's not just the music.
[02:19:01.020 --> 02:19:02.420]   I would love to hear the interviews.
[02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:04.340]   Yeah, I know what you're doing.
[02:19:04.340 --> 02:19:05.340]   I don't know what you did actually.
[02:19:05.340 --> 02:19:06.340]   It was just like-
[02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:07.340]   We just play it.
[02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:08.340]   You know, it's like the title-
[02:19:08.340 --> 02:19:09.340]   It's called The TARDIS.
[02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:10.340]   They do that.
[02:19:10.340 --> 02:19:11.340]   They do that.
[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:12.340]   They do that.
[02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:13.340]   They do that.
[02:19:13.340 --> 02:19:14.340]   They do that.
[02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:15.340]   They do that.
[02:19:15.340 --> 02:19:16.340]   They do that.
[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:17.340]   They do that.
[02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:18.340]   They do that.
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:19.340]   I know what I'm doing tonight.
[02:19:19.340 --> 02:19:20.340]   I know what you're doing.
[02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:21.340]   I know.
[02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:23.340]   That's what you listen to while you play a violin.
[02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:24.340]   Exactly.
[02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:25.340]   That's the beauty of the violin.
[02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:27.340]   The soundtrack is yours.
[02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:28.340]   That's the one.
[02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:32.860]   I mean, this is the nice thing about YouTube music in that it ends up having all these
[02:19:32.860 --> 02:19:34.380]   weird things that other people collect.
[02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:35.380]   Because of YouTube.
[02:19:35.380 --> 02:19:36.380]   Yeah.
[02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:37.380]   Yeah.
[02:19:37.380 --> 02:19:38.380]   Yeah.
[02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:39.380]   Yeah.
[02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:42.460]   Because the other one that I like is there's a version of the Pink Floyd Wishua here that
[02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:44.780]   they recorded, "Stephring Grappelli on Violin."
[02:19:44.780 --> 02:19:45.780]   Oh, wow.
[02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:47.300]   In the next studio.
[02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:48.300]   Wow.
[02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:52.340]   It's like there's lots of random stuff on YouTube once you start poking around the edges of
[02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:53.340]   it.
[02:19:53.340 --> 02:19:54.340]   Oh, for sure.
[02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:55.340]   Oh, nice.
[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:56.340]   Very cool.
[02:19:56.340 --> 02:20:03.340]   And you also mentioned earlier in the show Douglas Adams Hyperland, that exists on archive.org.
[02:20:03.340 --> 02:20:04.340]   Yeah.
[02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:11.460]   It's an offer recording from the BBC in 1990.
[02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:16.660]   I'm a huge Douglas Adams fan.
[02:20:16.660 --> 02:20:22.980]   I became aware of him when public radio in the US rebroadcast the original BBC, "Hitchaker's
[02:20:22.980 --> 02:20:23.980]   Guide."
[02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:26.380]   And it was the best radio I'd ever heard in my life.
[02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:32.340]   And that made me a fan prior to the books and the movies and all that.
[02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:33.340]   Hyperland.
[02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:34.340]   Wow, look.
[02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:36.340]   There's a Mac portable.
[02:20:36.340 --> 02:20:37.340]   This is great.
[02:20:37.340 --> 02:20:41.780]   Oh, I know what else I'm doing tonight.
[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:42.780]   It's a time capsule.
[02:20:42.780 --> 02:20:48.300]   And it is personally because it was made by friends I work with.
[02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:53.100]   We ended up working on the first start-up when we left the BBC.
[02:20:53.100 --> 02:20:58.780]   But it was him trying to give across the idea that interactivity was coming.
[02:20:58.780 --> 02:21:03.420]   But the web had it into consciousness yet because this was made in '89.
[02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:09.300]   So it's interviews with lots of, it has a lot of our bush and it has interviews with.
[02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:10.300]   Oh, really?
[02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:11.700]   Oh, so this is nonfiction.
[02:21:11.700 --> 02:21:15.780]   It's not fiction, but he's telling it in his own weird way.
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:22.820]   So he tells us he's having a dream and he throws his TV into a junkie.
[02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:24.820]   And then the avatar guy shows up and talks to him.
[02:21:24.820 --> 02:21:26.980]   So it's kind of fun.
[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:30.500]   Like walking to the aircraft and throwing the wretched object away.
[02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:32.900]   How is the TV still on?
[02:21:32.900 --> 02:21:34.860]   What's that plugged into?
[02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:35.860]   It's a dream.
[02:21:35.860 --> 02:21:36.860]   I don't understand.
[02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:37.860]   This is great.
[02:21:37.860 --> 02:21:42.860]   I can't wait.
[02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:43.860]   Nice.
[02:21:43.860 --> 02:21:45.340]   And he has Tom Baker as his intelligent agent.
[02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:46.980]   Oh, even better, Doctor Who.
[02:21:46.980 --> 02:21:49.620]   So this is Douglas Adams, hyperland.
[02:21:49.620 --> 02:21:51.100]   And you can find it on archive.org.
[02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:54.660]   And what's sad is there's only 5,000 views.
[02:21:54.660 --> 02:21:57.300]   Meanwhile, Gangnam Opo style is up to 18.
[02:21:57.300 --> 02:22:00.780]   It just shows you.
[02:22:00.780 --> 02:22:01.780]   Thank you.
[02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:03.340]   Kevin Marks, love having you here.
[02:22:03.340 --> 02:22:06.340]   Aunt Pruitt has always wraps us up with his pick of the week.
[02:22:06.340 --> 02:22:08.500]   Oh, I'll have a brief.
[02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:12.580]   The first one, they also relate in my opinion.
[02:22:12.580 --> 02:22:16.660]   The first one is audiobook that I just finished a couple of weeks ago.
[02:22:16.660 --> 02:22:19.940]   Nine nasty words by Mr. John McQuarter.
[02:22:19.940 --> 02:22:25.860]   And what I found interesting about it is that he goes into not just, okay, we all know
[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:31.340]   what curse words are, but yes, swear words and just the differences between that and
[02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:36.260]   how they came about and how they're used and how some people use them differently and
[02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:41.460]   how sometimes a bad word is not necessarily considered a bad word depending on context.
[02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:43.460]   It was really, really interesting.
[02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:48.660]   It made me think about some situations I've seen here in town with the hard heads and
[02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:52.260]   the teammates and the coaches and how they speak to one another.
[02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:56.340]   And I'm thinking, man, there's no way I would have been talking to my customers.
[02:22:56.340 --> 02:22:59.140]   Yeah, you were brought up not to use that.
[02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:01.700]   There was no way.
[02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:02.700]   You know, there was-
[02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:03.980]   The times have changed a little bit, right?
[02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:08.940]   And then the time Isaiah comes home and he says, "Hey, Andy wants to know if we can have
[02:23:08.940 --> 02:23:11.980]   a teen meeting here at the house."
[02:23:11.980 --> 02:23:14.500]   And I'm like, "Who the heck is Andy?"
[02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:15.500]   He says, "The coach."
[02:23:15.500 --> 02:23:18.500]   I say, "You mean coach so-and-so?"
[02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:20.860]   He said, "No, his name is Andy."
[02:23:20.860 --> 02:23:23.900]   And it's just a generational difference.
[02:23:23.900 --> 02:23:25.140]   I'm like, "It is."
[02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:26.140]   No way.
[02:23:26.140 --> 02:23:27.140]   It's also California.
[02:23:27.140 --> 02:23:28.140]   Yeah, there's that too.
[02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:30.540]   We're pretty relaxed here.
[02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:34.860]   But that book just made me think a lot about those conversations I've had with Dan.
[02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:57.260]   I love John
[02:23:57.260 --> 02:24:03.140]   really, really like.
[02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:04.620]   And he's good.
[02:24:04.620 --> 02:24:06.500]   And what I like about him is he's not necessarily doing it to be liked by everybody because he's-
[02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:07.500]   Apparently.
[02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:08.500]   He's got a lot of controversial things.
[02:24:08.500 --> 02:24:12.820]   You know, and there's a lot of people that don't like what he has to say, but I listen
[02:24:12.820 --> 02:24:13.820]   to it.
[02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:14.980]   I'm like, "You know what I get where he's coming from.
[02:24:14.980 --> 02:24:15.980]   Yeah.
[02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:20.220]   It's not going to be popular, but I get where he's coming from."
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:25.580]   And the next thing, this made me think about another generational type of thing.
[02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:33.900]   This article, this is from the German Judo coach, the Olympic team.
[02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:39.900]   He was slapping one of his participants, one of his players, before a match.
[02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:43.340]   She requested it as part of, "All right.
[02:24:43.340 --> 02:24:47.340]   This is gank go time for me in this match.
[02:24:47.340 --> 02:24:48.340]   Pucked me up coach."
[02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:50.500]   And he shakes her and he slaps her in the face.
[02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:53.300]   And there's video of it and whatnot.
[02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:56.580]   And people went wild and did not agree to it.
[02:24:56.580 --> 02:25:02.140]   And the governing body at the Olympics raised the question and said, "Hey, we're not allowing
[02:25:02.140 --> 02:25:03.140]   that."
[02:25:03.140 --> 02:25:08.940]   At the same time, when I saw the video myself, I said, "Oh, I remember when my coaches used
[02:25:08.940 --> 02:25:14.100]   to grab me and yell at me and slap me across the head and I absolutely loved it.
[02:25:14.100 --> 02:25:15.340]   I needed that."
[02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:18.220]   You know, it pumped me up.
[02:25:18.220 --> 02:25:19.220]   Yeah.
[02:25:19.220 --> 02:25:20.780]   She looks completely cooperative.
[02:25:20.780 --> 02:25:21.780]   She wanted it.
[02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:22.780]   She asked for it.
[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:23.780]   And she said her stuff.
[02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:26.100]   And that's a bad phrase to use in this context.
[02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:28.860]   But this was something that they do, obviously.
[02:25:28.860 --> 02:25:30.300]   And she was expecting it.
[02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:32.100]   It was not unexpected.
[02:25:32.100 --> 02:25:33.100]   Right.
[02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:34.260]   And she said, "Thank you."
[02:25:34.260 --> 02:25:35.900]   At the end, she said, "Not it."
[02:25:35.900 --> 02:25:37.100]   And said, "Thank you."
[02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:40.780]   And I thought, I saw it at and saw the reaction from the press.
[02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:44.620]   And I'm like, "Man, this is just a whole different generation of things."
[02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:46.860]   And people have disagreed with me.
[02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:47.860]   And I get it.
[02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:48.860]   You can disagree with me.
[02:25:48.860 --> 02:25:54.340]   So I had some really, really special relationships with coaches in my past that I love to this
[02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:55.780]   day.
[02:25:55.780 --> 02:26:00.740]   And we spoke that language when it came time to go out and run that race.
[02:26:00.740 --> 02:26:03.380]   That coach yelled at me a certain way that a teammate couldn't.
[02:26:03.380 --> 02:26:05.500]   They just slapped me before every show.
[02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:06.500]   I think it's hard.
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:07.500]   Right.
[02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:08.500]   That's it.
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:11.340]   And so then this leads into my next video here.
[02:26:11.340 --> 02:26:14.820]   This was Max Day with the hard heads and I.
[02:26:14.820 --> 02:26:19.620]   And if you turn up the sound, you can hear, "I'm talking to myself, but then I couldn't
[02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:22.820]   stop laughing because if you look at my hard heads, face."
[02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:24.140]   Let me just do some math here.
[02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:31.420]   There's one, two, three, four, five, six, 45 pound weights, 45 pound bar.
[02:26:31.420 --> 02:26:32.980]   So that's seven times.
[02:26:32.980 --> 02:26:35.500]   There's 280, 315 pounds.
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:36.500]   And there's more.
[02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:38.700]   There's a couple of, why even bother with the 5.0?
[02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:39.700]   What are you nuts?
[02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:41.500]   Well, there's tens and 5s on it.
[02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:42.900]   It ended up being 355.
[02:26:42.900 --> 02:26:43.900]   355?
[02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:44.900]   Yes, sir.
[02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:45.900]   He's benching 355.
[02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:47.900]   Thank God you got the spotter.
[02:26:47.900 --> 02:26:49.900]   It was a Max Day.
[02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:50.900]   We've been back to the living.
[02:26:50.900 --> 02:26:53.220]   I don't think he's strong enough to spot you.
[02:26:53.220 --> 02:26:54.220]   Watch his face.
[02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:55.220]   Watch his face.
[02:26:55.220 --> 02:26:57.540]   What are you lifting that for?
[02:26:57.540 --> 02:26:58.540]   Dead.
[02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:04.540]   But if you listen to me, two, man.
[02:27:04.540 --> 02:27:10.020]   But if you listen, I'm talking to myself because that's just part of me.
[02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:11.020]   That's how you do it.
[02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:14.220]   Yeah, if you slap yourself, if you could.
[02:27:14.220 --> 02:27:15.220]   Right.
[02:27:15.220 --> 02:27:20.100]   And there was a guy in there in the gym that was pretty loud and he was sort of getting
[02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:21.100]   in my head.
[02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:22.380]   It's just part of motivation.
[02:27:22.380 --> 02:27:27.780]   And the way that coach was helping out his player and the way she wanted that help is
[02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:29.220]   just something that stuck with me.
[02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:31.340]   And I'm like, yeah, I get where she's coming from.
[02:27:31.340 --> 02:27:34.940]   Yeah, although, but the face would want to be slapped by anybody who could bridge the
[02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:35.940]   bench 380.
[02:27:35.940 --> 02:27:36.940]   So don't hit me.
[02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:40.020]   We have a hood.
[02:27:40.020 --> 02:27:43.260]   We've been lifting for about a month now since the gym's opened back up.
[02:27:43.260 --> 02:27:44.740]   Has he and he enjoys doing it with you?
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:45.740]   That's a nice father.
[02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:49.540]   Yeah, we all go in there and they've been crushing it and I said, okay, it's Max Day.
[02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:53.420]   So let's go do Max Day and see where we stand and we're all happy with our numbers.
[02:27:53.420 --> 02:27:56.220]   Did you know, did you know you were going to be able to do that one?
[02:27:56.220 --> 02:28:00.100]   I thought that I could do at least 350 based on my workouts.
[02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:01.100]   Yeah.
[02:28:01.100 --> 02:28:02.780]   But I'm not going to go any more than that.
[02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:03.780]   I'm going to.
[02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:04.780]   That's awesome.
[02:28:04.780 --> 02:28:05.780]   I'm over 40.
[02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:07.700]   I don't need to be doing much more.
[02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:16.380]   I'd be happy to lift a bar and pro it hands on photography, twit.tv/hop.
[02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:17.380]   Always a pleasure.
[02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:21.700]   He'll be here at course next week on twig two.
[02:28:21.700 --> 02:28:23.420]   Love you and your work.
[02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:24.420]   Keep it up.
[02:28:24.420 --> 02:28:25.420]   Thank you.
[02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:26.900]   I called you the Bob Ross of photography.
[02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:29.540]   I try and interview the other day.
[02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:30.700]   You're good.
[02:28:30.700 --> 02:28:31.940]   Calm collected.
[02:28:31.940 --> 02:28:32.940]   Very reassuring.
[02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:34.140]   Unless you throw me in the weight room.
[02:28:34.140 --> 02:28:35.140]   I'm not so calm.
[02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:36.140]   Yeah.
[02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:37.940]   I saw Bob Ross press 350.
[02:28:37.940 --> 02:28:42.860]   I can tell you that right now, right now.
[02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:45.940]   Jason Howell be back on all about Android next Tuesday.
[02:28:45.940 --> 02:28:49.500]   And of course tomorrow tech news weekly with Micah.
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:50.500]   It's always nice.
[02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:51.500]   Thank you for.
[02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:52.500]   I know you didn't have much notice.
[02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:53.500]   Thank you for filling in on.
[02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:54.500]   Absolutely.
[02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:55.500]   No, this is a lot of fun.
[02:28:55.500 --> 02:28:56.500]   He makes it look so easy.
[02:28:56.500 --> 02:28:59.300]   I can't believe he goes through the whole alphabet with it.
[02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:02.340]   We've had a lot of practice in all that.
[02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:03.340]   Very impressive.
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:04.340]   Yeah.
[02:29:04.340 --> 02:29:05.340]   Very impressive.
[02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:11.060]   And of course the great Kevin Marks, the only person I know is worked for Apple, Google,
[02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:13.740]   BBC and British Telecom.
[02:29:13.740 --> 02:29:15.060]   They all call him a traitor.
[02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:16.060]   Kind of amazing.
[02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:18.220]   Dray, no, no.
[02:29:18.220 --> 02:29:21.020]   He's got good terms with all of them.
[02:29:21.020 --> 02:29:22.980]   indieweb.com.
[02:29:22.980 --> 02:29:23.980]   I'm sorry.
[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:24.980]   .org.
[02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:28.900]   You want to give a plug for why we need indieweb.org?
[02:29:28.900 --> 02:29:35.300]   Well, indieweb is about having your own website so that you can build a list of all the
[02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:39.620]   songs that appear on YouTube or anything you want to publish yourself and not have to
[02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:44.380]   worry about it making way through Facebook or having to buy adverts to show it to people.
[02:29:44.380 --> 02:29:45.380]   That's interesting.
[02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:49.460]   And there's a lot of resources on indieweb for not only how you can make your own website
[02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:55.140]   and host it but also how you can interoperate with others so that you can join a large and
[02:29:55.140 --> 02:30:01.200]   growing group I think of people who believe that we as individuals should be the people
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:03.940]   who make the web, not the big companies.
[02:30:03.940 --> 02:30:08.660]   And of course there's indiewebcamp and their regular indieweb meetings and pop-ups.
[02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:12.140]   If you want to go to the homebrew website club meetings you can.
[02:30:12.140 --> 02:30:15.420]   It's actually very easy because they're on Zoom now.
[02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:21.420]   You can go tonight at 6 p.m. Pacific to the homebrew website club for the Americas.
[02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:23.860]   That's in West Coast time.
[02:30:23.860 --> 02:30:27.540]   All of that is available at indieweb.org.
[02:30:27.540 --> 02:30:28.540]   I love that.
[02:30:28.540 --> 02:30:29.620]   I think that's so great.
[02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:31.700]   I totally support what you're doing.
[02:30:31.700 --> 02:30:34.180]   I couldn't agree more.
[02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:35.740]   Couldn't agree more.
[02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:40.540]   I use Hugo to run my website and it's just great.
[02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:41.540]   That's good.
[02:30:41.540 --> 02:30:42.540]   It's all in the markdown.
[02:30:42.540 --> 02:30:47.740]   Yeah, it's static, it's fast, it's easy, I love it.
[02:30:47.740 --> 02:30:50.380]   You need a pill though to help people write more.
[02:30:50.380 --> 02:30:52.380]   I don't know if you got it.
[02:30:52.380 --> 02:30:57.660]   Well, I mean the thing we're working on at the moment which is they're not quite available
[02:30:57.660 --> 02:31:01.020]   to everyone yet but we've got building social readers out.
[02:31:01.020 --> 02:31:07.540]   It's a feed reader but because you've got micropub to let you publish your own site,
[02:31:07.540 --> 02:31:11.380]   it's a feed reader that you can comment and star and like things and it publishes back
[02:31:11.380 --> 02:31:12.900]   to your own site.
[02:31:12.900 --> 02:31:15.820]   So that's something that we've sort of played together.
[02:31:15.820 --> 02:31:17.060]   Oh, I like that.
[02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:18.060]   Yeah.
[02:31:18.060 --> 02:31:19.060]   So you've got protocols for that.
[02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:20.060]   Yeah.
[02:31:20.060 --> 02:31:21.060]   Yeah, that would be good.
[02:31:21.060 --> 02:31:22.060]   That would be good.
[02:31:22.060 --> 02:31:23.460]   Maybe with my comments or something.
[02:31:23.460 --> 02:31:24.460]   Yeah.
[02:31:24.460 --> 02:31:26.580]   I notice a pay as a piggyny.
[02:31:26.580 --> 02:31:29.060]   Your blog on blogspot hasn't had anything for three years.
[02:31:29.060 --> 02:31:30.060]   So I don't feel...
[02:31:30.060 --> 02:31:31.060]   I'm so bad.
[02:31:31.060 --> 02:31:32.060]   Why?
[02:31:32.060 --> 02:31:35.060]   My KevinMarks.com has.
[02:31:35.060 --> 02:31:36.060]   Oh, okay.
[02:31:36.060 --> 02:31:38.060]   So that's your news site is KevinMarks.com.
[02:31:38.060 --> 02:31:39.060]   KevinMarks.com.
[02:31:39.060 --> 02:31:40.060]   All right.
[02:31:40.060 --> 02:31:46.300]   And I've got a known blog that I put some of the other bits and pieces on there as well.
[02:31:46.300 --> 02:31:49.620]   KevinMarks.com is where you get the most of these things.
[02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:51.180]   Nice.
[02:31:51.180 --> 02:31:52.180]   Thank you, Kevin.
[02:31:52.180 --> 02:31:54.580]   It's a real pleasure to have you on and I hope you come back.
[02:31:54.580 --> 02:31:55.980]   It's nice to chat to you.
[02:31:55.980 --> 02:31:57.980]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:31:57.980 --> 02:32:01.500]   It's a real pleasure to have you in the audience.
[02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:03.780]   Thank you for listening for watching.
[02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:06.260]   You can watch us do it live.
[02:32:06.260 --> 02:32:11.340]   It's a little different from the final version, but we do that every Wednesday about 2 p.m.
[02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:20.660]   Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC that livestream audio or video is available at twitter.tv/live.
[02:32:20.660 --> 02:32:24.300]   And I have to say get there too because there's always stuff even a little early because there's
[02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:30.300]   always we had a fun conversation involving butts maybe.
[02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:32.260]   Maybe could be.
[02:32:32.260 --> 02:32:38.300]   Not anybody we know spots, but hatching.
[02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:39.300]   Yeah.
[02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:43.900]   Anyway, it's hard to describe, but if you're here live, you don't have to.
[02:32:43.900 --> 02:32:47.260]   Let's just say it's way less weird that it's based out.
[02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:48.260]   Yeah.
[02:32:48.260 --> 02:32:49.260]   Yeah.
[02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:51.660]   If you're watching live chat with us live.
[02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:52.660]   Of course there's the IRC.
[02:32:52.660 --> 02:32:54.700]   It's been here since I started.
[02:32:54.700 --> 02:32:56.700]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:32:56.700 --> 02:32:57.700]   We've been doing that.
[02:32:57.700 --> 02:33:02.620]   I've been doing an IRC channel during my shows since the early 90s.
[02:33:02.620 --> 02:33:04.260]   It's an old school technology.
[02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:06.740]   We'd also have the new stuff, the Discord channel.
[02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:09.780]   If you're a member of Club Twitch, you can join us in there as well.
[02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:13.540]   All those people are watching live as they chat live.
[02:33:13.540 --> 02:33:18.300]   On demand versions of the show available at the website, twit.tv/twig.
[02:33:18.300 --> 02:33:23.300]   If you're there, you'll also see a link to the Amazon page where I'm sorry, Amazon.
[02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:24.660]   What was I talking about?
[02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:25.660]   YouTube page.
[02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:27.460]   All the videos are starting.
[02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:29.260]   I don't think we have anything on Amazon.
[02:33:29.260 --> 02:33:35.060]   You'll also find links to the podcast clients, the big ones, so you can easily subscribe
[02:33:35.060 --> 02:33:36.060]   there.
[02:33:36.060 --> 02:33:41.140]   If you do subscribe to us in a podcatcher, please, if they have reviews, leave us a five
[02:33:41.140 --> 02:33:42.140]   star review.
[02:33:42.140 --> 02:33:44.180]   We really want to spread the word, let everybody know.
[02:33:44.180 --> 02:33:47.940]   What a fun show this is to listen to over Wednesday.
[02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:51.900]   You can also get it if you listen to the user podcast player automatically.
[02:33:51.900 --> 02:33:55.060]   You don't have to think about it then it's on your device and you can listen offline
[02:33:55.060 --> 02:33:56.620]   anytime you want to.
[02:33:56.620 --> 02:34:02.940]   If you are an offline listener, don't forget you can communicate with us, join the conversation
[02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:06.580]   on our forums, www.twit.community.
[02:34:06.580 --> 02:34:13.460]   And on our Mastodon instance, we're part of the Fediverse at twit.social.
[02:34:13.460 --> 02:34:16.020]   And I think that's all we have to say for today.
[02:34:16.020 --> 02:34:17.580]   Believe it or not, we've run out of words.
[02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:18.580]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:20.980]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[02:34:20.980 --> 02:34:21.980]   Bye bye.
[02:34:21.980 --> 02:34:27.020]   Hey, I hope you enjoyed that episode.
[02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:32.620]   If you are interested in checking out all things smart home and Internet of Things, then
[02:34:32.620 --> 02:34:35.540]   you should check out Smart Tech Today.
[02:34:35.540 --> 02:34:40.260]   The podcast I'm Mike Asargent to do with my cohost Matthew Cassinelli.
[02:34:40.260 --> 02:34:44.860]   It's all about the smart home and improving your automations.
