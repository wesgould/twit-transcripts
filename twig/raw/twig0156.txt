[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show the covers.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   You know, I got to be very clear about this. It says Google in the name. It really covers the cloud.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We can cover Facebook, Twitter, whatever's happening in that thing.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Out there, the little puffiness we call the cloud.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Starting with Gina Trapani, who is at Etsy this week. Hi Gina.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Hi, I'm Hi. At the office this week, there's a hack week going on here.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So this place is filled with handmade scarves and hardworking coders.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   So what do you mean a hack week? What does that mean?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Oh, they invited a bunch of coders in to hack on Etsy features.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I see.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You know, I think they have a judging and that kind of thing.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So the office is pretty busy and open today. It's pretty cool.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Every single desk here is handmade. I mean, these people, they live it.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   They're not sure that's a good idea.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I don't know why, but I think handmade is wobbly. It sounds wobbly. That's all.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm just saying. I got it.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Also here with this, as always, Jeff Jarvis, the city professor of journalism at the city
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   University of New York. Hello, Jeff. Hello. Hello. So Gina, there's a,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   my office is in the Shimada district.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And there's a storefront I just saw that has a fancy, amazing, modern knitting machine
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   in it. And they kind of talk about hacking that.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Oh, yeah, because it uses a computer. It's like a 3D printer, right?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Yeah, you need an API. Yeah, I hacked some knitting machines.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   That's neat. Also here, Kevin Purdy, author of the complete guide to Android. Kevin, good to see you.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Okay, complete Android guide.com. Sorry. Let's get it right.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   No, let's get it right. Let's get it right. These titles.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You know, actually, Gina, when you talk about a hacker week or a hack week,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   it reminded me of that letter that Mark Zuckerberg wrote to investors when they were doing the road trip for the IPO,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   in which he said, "We're hackers. We're not, we want to be more hackery.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   We're not, the hacker way is the way to do it. And the thing that kills businesses
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   is when they get entrenched and get middle management to manage hackers.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And that's antithetical to the hacker way. I thought that was fascinating.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yeah, it was such a great point. I was just talking to the CEO here at Etsy,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and they were saying that they deploy code several times a day.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And on your first day at work at Etsy, you deploy code.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And it's very much that like it at rapid iteration, you know, break things and fix them later
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   that that holds kind of Zuckerberg philosophy.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yeah, that letter is interesting. It talks about, you know, the open web and the hacker way.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And Facebook is not, I mean, you know, it's an incredible product, right?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   But it's not very open. There's a piece in Wired about this about whether or not Facebook is a monopoly.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And if they've, you know, are closed the web more.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   But yeah, Facebook, that letter also was really just interesting that it was piled up in all
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   the financial statements during their IPO tour.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   The weird document amongst the rest.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   He writes, hackers try to build the best services over the long term by quickly releasing
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and learning from smaller iterations rather than trying to get everything right all at once.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Done is better than perfect. We have the words painted on our walls.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Done is better than perfect.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   That was kind of like Steve Jobs who said, "Great Artist Ship."
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yes.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It's meaningless if you make something perfect that you never ship.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   He also says to encourage this approach every few months, we have a hackathon, which is what's going on at Etsy right now,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   where everyone builds prototypes for new ideas.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   They have in fact, they had a hack, all night hackathon, the night of the IPO.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   To make sure all our engineers share this approach,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   we require all new engineers, even managers whose primary job will not be to write code to go through a program
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   called Bootcamp where they learn our code base, our tools, and our approach.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It really is almost anti-middle management.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It's almost pro like the kind of sophisticated form.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Company of plus?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yes.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   It's use your API, build on your own API.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It's the other thing that we keep on hearing.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Let me ask you both.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   All of you, in the news business, it's hot to have hacks and hackers hackathons because journalists are called hacks.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   But they don't often put out anything that's terribly useful.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Then people get together and say, "Oh, I touched a code this weekend and we made something."
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And then nothing comes out of it.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Does a hackathon need to be in a context like a company?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   You mean a hackathon?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So there's a hacks hackers group out in Rochester that actually took the local election website, which was totally
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   non-verified, non-searchable and stackable data and turned it into an API.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So on election night, instead of having to hit refresh and load scripts that automatically refresh the page,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   they could actually pull numbers as they appear on the website without having to get a government grant or anything.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And did that code get implemented?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Did it get put in the site?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I'm seeing it every year, I'm pretty sure.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I'm hacks hackers, Rochester.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Let's start.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   But that's a small bore target.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   It's not like they're reinventing some part of journalism.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It's just there's a problem with something we want to write.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Let's fix it.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Yeah, I probably shouldn't say this because I'm here and I love Etsy and I think it's great.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   They're doing Hack Week.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   But I've always been a little skeptical about hack days and startup weekends and Hack Week because it's this idea that
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   you're going to go in and you're going to launch a company or create a product.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And they're really just, you don't hear about many products that were born out of hack days.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   It's not unheard of.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   But features, you often hear features that are born out of hacking, don't you?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Right.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   You often hear that engineers at a company during the Hack Week end when they have freedom to do what they want, take up a kind of a passion project,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   ship a feature.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Right.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   But I think the purpose of these things is more about social coding, meaning being in a room with a bunch of other people who are
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   wrangling with the same API and getting questions, answers and just getting used to interacting with the tools.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And so maybe a product doesn't launch, but you have, the company comes out with a bunch of developers who now have very intimate knowledge
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   of their API and that gets kind of get stored in the back of their heads and any things that they go forward and thinking
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   about in terms of apps they want to build or things that they can do, they then have that knowledge.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Getting coders in a room to all look at the documentation together and hack together is very, very powerful rather than
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   having a bunch of coders just kind of alone in their basements, you know, reading the documentation.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I think that might be a lot of the point of that, right, is the social aspect of it.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Absolutely.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   I also find it interesting that Etsy sees itself very clearly as a technology company, not as an auction site or whatever it is,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   not auction a craft platform.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   But I mean, obviously they're focused on crafts.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I mean, you were saying you're sitting in a room where even the ducts are wrapped in knitted products.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And it's carbs.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   So they're very aware of that, but it's interesting.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   See, we have that, this is, I'm thinking about this in terms of Twiit because we can't decide, are we a media company?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Well, we are a media company.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   We are in many ways a traditional media company except that we are delivered just as Etsy is in many ways a traditional
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   e-commerce site or a commerce site.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Boy, we're hearing that debate all over.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   So it was Marissa Meyer and Yahoo! is it a technology company, is a media company?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Then Twitter, Dick Costolo was answering that question just last week.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Now you know, I mean, I'm starting to think as mean, that's because the problem is that what's a media company?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Well, I guess the question is, our product is content, yes?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   But unfortunately, in this modern age, we have to pay attention to delivery because we're inventing in some way.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   You know, if you're, if you want to do a television or radio station, it's such a well-known thing that you don't have, you have an engineer, you have a staff,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   but they know what to do. It's kind of a well-known, but here we're kind of making up how it's still too, so early in the technology phase,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   we spent a lot of time with technology still.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I would say your product is not content.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   What is it? Content is a tool that your product, your value, for this way, your value is the relationships you have.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Well, I agree with that, but we do, but the sugar is...
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And so the sugar is...
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And so the content is a tool that comes in to do that, but it's the relationship you have with people that really matters.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And I think it's really important...
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   But that's true of any business.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Every business, it's about your relationship with the customers, not the product.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   But that's just the problem.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I spoke to 50 CEOs, international CEOs from Big Magazine Company on Monday, and I gave their same spiel,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   and somebody could say, "Oh, it's just another Jarvis tweet."
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   But I mean it.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Content is a tool that goes to the relationship, and Facebook and Google and you and others are at sea,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   are built on finding and extracting the value out of those relationships.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Whereas media companies think their entire value is in the content, and that's why they want to sell their content,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   and they're done with the business.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   We're right, I have no desire to sell our content.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Every once in a while, in fact, had a conversation with a Hollywood producer on Monday saying,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   "G4 would buy your content. If we could take it and we could massage it."
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And I said, "Under no circumstances are you to pitch G4 anything."
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   But I don't see ourselves as a content company.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   He said, "You got all this great content, and you're right."
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I couldn't figure out why that didn't feel right.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Because your relationship...
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I don't want somebody to buy the content like apples and resell it.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   We're not about apples.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   We're about our relationship with our audience.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Truly have a community here.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And that's why you've said before that you don't want more than 100,000 people because or they're abouts.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I don't know what twig and twit are, but you want it to be focused in a community and workable.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I won't put a limit on the numbers, but we don't focus on the numbers.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Right.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   You don't make it, you don't say that the goal is billions, because when you do, that's the whole problem with page views and media.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It corrupted the business all across.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   That's interesting.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Media and made...
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   That's more and more and more and more.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And what I say to media companies now is you should make your new metric.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Who do we know?
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   What do we know about them in ways that we can give them value back because of that?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Well, then get ready for this because Twitter and Hollywood are working on an in-stream video series.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   This is from adweek.com.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Forget the debate over whether Twitter wants to get in the media business.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Twitter wants to be a media player.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   The San Francisco company along with multiple Hollywood producers and network execs are in serious talks about the possibility of launching.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   I don't even understand how this would work.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Several original video series via Twitter.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Talk about a company that's confused about their business.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   What the hell does that mean?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   One project in particular could debut this year, potentially as early as in the fall.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   They've been pitching this to a select group of advertisers, a video series that would live on Twitter and enable users to participate in real time in some fashion.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   The series has been described by sources as similar to MTV reality shows, The Real World and The Hills.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   In fact, one of the producers behind The Hills is said to be behind the project.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   The show could live on a standalone Twitter page, similar to the events page Twitter launched with NASCAR in June.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Or maybe the series would be distributed within tweets.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   [laughter]
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Because tweets become rich so you can watch the little segment.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   They hired a friend of mine named Fred Graver.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Fred, I bow to him because he was a writer on both Letterman and Cheers.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   He started Best Week Ever for VH1.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Isn't this somebody saying, "I know how to do this, so let's shoehorn my style of content into your
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   140 character blog, mini blog?"
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   It's like me eating you head with Hollywood.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Yeah, I think it could be.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Unless you rethink why should Twitter create that?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   If Twitter is of course is Twitter platform.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Dick Costamolo told The Wall Street Journal this week, "Twitter is right germane to this conversation, a technology company in the media business."
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But then it's trying to become to make media.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   The next story in the rundown is Twitter did a deal with SiriusXM to make a show about politics based on tweets, talking about soundlights.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Yeah, it's in this schizo world of...
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   I think it's leaving the idea of being a platform.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   That's why it's changed the relationship with the developers.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   That's why it's trying to own more things.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   It's trying to own more things.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   They think they're a content company.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Are they...is this smart?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Is this right?
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Is this a last ditch effort to monetize or a clever move, a visionary move understanding better than anyone with their businesses?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   I underestimate Twitter at my peril.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I mean, I don't think it's a last ditch effort.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I think it's a very strategic decision.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It remains to be seen whether or not it'll work out.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Clearly, Twitter cares about right now making tweets more than just 140 characters.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   The embeddable rich media, they want eyeballs on the site where they can show you ads, where they can show you promoted tweets, where they can show you promoted accounts.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   That's where they get paid.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And they want tweets to be richer than just 140 characters, which is a little sad to me because the kind of thing I love about Twitter is that it's 140 characters of text and that's its roots.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   But you know...
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   ...and the pandemic pentameter, yeah.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   You know, it started a company...look, to me, stupidity in the nth degree.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   You started a company doing a microblog, 140 characters.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   You built it up for people like me and Gina who loved that idea and Jeff, and then you say, "Oh no, a new idea."
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   We're a media content company. We're gonna distribute media.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   That's just stupid.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   They would say that they're a media platform, right? They're trying to be Facebook in a way. They want to create a platform where you can plug content into their web interface seamlessly to bring more people to the website.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   But isn't that...I mean, Facebook, you could do that. But Twitter seems like that's a stretch.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   To me, it's not the 140 character limit. It's the fact that my relationship with Twitter is such that I know that Twitter is the thing I go to when I have something to say or something to say.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Or when I want to see what's going on. And I don't think a politics series or a...gill shutter, hills-like show.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   That kind of breaks everything I know about Twitter, and I'm not trying to sound like I'm from the 1920s. I just...I won't think of Twitter that way.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   But that's the point. You cannot just decide, "Oh, hey, remember we are the one thing now or something else."
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   But every other media uses Twitter as a place to have conversations. I mean, every TV show, prime time TV shows have hashtags on the bottom of the screen, right?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   So people are watching TV online and talking about on Twitter. Twitter wants a piece of that. They want to run their own. They want people to have common experiences and talk about them on Twitter.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   And they want them to get that media to begin with from Twitter.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Stupid.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   I mean, I appreciate...I think that...I don't really know how I feel about it. I don't feel like it's a last-ditch effort at revenue. I think this is a very strategic decision for them.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   They've decided to be more than just a communications platform. And I'm interested to see where it goes. I'm personally not so like...I'm not on fire about the idea of watching a reality show on Twitter.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   But I am interested to see how they do it because Twitter's got some pretty great product folks there.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   By the way, a pivot is a well-accepted thing in this industry and it works often for many companies. But you only pivot when you have failed the first thing.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And Twitter has clearly not failed at the first thing. So what they're showing to me is ADD. They're showing to me an inability to focus, "Oh, let's do that!"
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Well, or it's not...Pivot isn't just failure. I think pivot is also building on success. Two examples, right? One is Amazon.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   It starts as bookstore, becomes general retailer, becomes content distributor, becomes...
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Right. That's not a pivot. That's expanding. That's building.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   It's an enhancement.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   It's enhancing.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Well, same with Google. So is Google pivoting by starting as a search company, becoming an ad company, becoming a services company, becoming a mobile company?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Is that a pivot or is that a...
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   No, that's a good question. That's a judgment calling that one.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   So if you build on Twitter, I think Twitter, if Twitter's users started just on their own, using Twitter in neat ways to start to distribute video in ways we never thought of, then I'd probably say, "Cool."
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   That's organic.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   That's organic.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Your happy here is that instead Twitter says, "Let's force this through the sieve and let's turn ourselves and let's demonstrate how we are a TV company."
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Right.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   So you look at the difference in YouTube.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   They wanted to do this before, remember. I mean, this is not the first time.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Yeah. And the other problem is, and this is where they really realized that they went off the mark, but I think they were on the mark and they're wrong about the decision that was off the mark, is that by having developers create clients, that's what made Twitter explode.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   That's how I experience Twitter.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   But I can't experience the tweets the way Twitter wants me to experience them now because they're out of control. That's what an API does to you.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   You lose control.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   That's exactly the point.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And either you build the company around losing control as a benefit, which I think is the Internet way to do it, or you build the company around holding on to control.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   But when you do that, you limit yourself.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   And I think that that's the danger that Twitter is in right now.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   It built as being an API and giving control to developers and others.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And now to try to do these new things, you've got to bring back control.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   And as my friend, long ago, I had to talk to her and she was a friend of mine, said to her famous celebrity lesbian mate who then tried to recant this.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   She said, "You can't go back in the closet."
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I hate that the truth.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And so I think that that's the essence what Twitter is trying to do, is they're trying to go back into the closet of becoming a controlling, centralizing media company.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   But again, I've been wrong about them before, and I'm not condemning it.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   I'm just always befuddled by them.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   But this isn't too, doesn't feel like too much of a pivot to me.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   I think because I went to the Twitter dev conference, I think it was called Chirp, like in 2010.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   And they announced this thing that never came to fruition called Twitter annotations.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Do you guys remember that?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Yeah. And I remember how excited we all were about it.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Yeah, we were pretty excited.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   It was a way to attach any random metadata, arbitrary metadata to any tweet to add to the payload.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   And the idea was that your app could display, could attach data to tweet, store it in Twitter's data store, and render it in your app.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   And it was really exciting to me because I was like, wow, the possibilities seem endless.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   You could attach a tweet to anything.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And they never shipped it.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   I never heard anything about it after that.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   But this feels like an iteration of that with just a lot more control, right?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   So we're going to embed this media content into tweets, and we're going to put it out through Twitter and have our users' resources.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And have our users interact around it.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   So I'm waiting to pass judgment.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   I'm interested to see what the API is going to look like.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Once they start launching this embedded media, do developers have access to that metadata?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Can they render it in their apps? Can they add to it?
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Is it just partners? They can do this, or can anyone do this? I'm interested to see.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   You compare this to stuff this week from YouTube, if I may lay out.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And I think ties in directly.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   What YouTube is doing at the same time, they had two big announcements.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   I think big announcements today.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   The lesser of the two is that they've opened a creative studio for their people in London, which is very much like Etsy.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   When they want people to make stuff, help them make it.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   So Etsy's creating workspaces and creative spaces.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And the second thing they're doing, they did a big deal with Creative Commons to bring forward just tons of video for remixing.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   And so then you're enabling, you're truly acting like a platform of all cases.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   And we're saying, we're here to help you create. We're a distributor. We're going to get it around for you.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   You go make the cool stuff.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And we'll invest in it, and we'll create stuff to help you do it.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   But we don't create, you create.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   I just feel like otherwise, in a channel conflict, I think.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   I think YouTube should announce 140 character blogging, micro-blogging site.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And then everything would all be right with the world.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   I don't know. Why do I want to put somebody in a box?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   I want to do whatever it wants to do.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   But it's interesting that companies, as companies, are fleeing the idea of being media companies.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Exactly. It's a rotten business.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And that was when this discussion was on Twitter today, without video, no reality show.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   People were talking, and I was saying, the response back was, "But everybody at Media Company, is that what we say?"
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Yeah, nobody is a media company, because everybody else.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Right. There's no distinction.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   I'll do it now.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   I mean, if you think about how Google+ uses Hangouts, you could do a show in Google+.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   It's got embedded in it.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   You've already doing it.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   We're talking. Kevin Purdy is here.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Completeandroidguide.com.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Should say everything you need in three words.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Completeandroidguide.com.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   It's the Shazazzle.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   [laughter]
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Etsy lady is here. She's not with Etsy, but she's handmade.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Ms. Jim Drapani.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   I'm wearing something her medsie today.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Oh, that's cute. Let me see. What is that?
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It's the serotonin molecule.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Wow, that's cool. I know I see people with caffeine molecule t-shirts,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   but a serotonin molecule necklace.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Now, that is cool.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   What does that mean?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   If you look at that, do you go into ecstasy?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Yeah, I'm just happy all the time.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Where do you think this smile comes from?
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   That is a neat necklace. I like that.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   A molecular structure. Thank you.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   You know who was here who was a block away yesterday, Chris Colfer.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   What?
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   I go out the door.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   My boyfriend.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   I know. I go out the door.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   There are hundreds of teenage girls.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Screaming for the gay kid?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   I love you, Chris. I want to hold your hand.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   There's a bookstore across the street.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   The last bookstore in the United States of America is across the street.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   We're in Petaluma. It's a town of 55,000 people.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Book signing, Chris has a new book, I guess.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Wow.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And he's doing a book signing.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   I know. He's doing a book signing.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And the line literally goes down around the block, around that block, around that block.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   I mean, it went on for hours.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Teenage girls.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And there's like two guys in the entire line.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Right.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And their dads embarrassed.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And the rest is preteen girls.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   You know why? Because he's not threatening.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   He's like the perfect boyfriend.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   He won't lay a hand on you.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   And he's cute.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And he can sing.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Yes, he can start.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Exactly.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I think it's a children's book.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Oh, is it?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   I think he went it on that.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Anyway, what's thick?
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   It's like it might be a young adult.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   It's not like a picture book.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   I, I, I, it's a retelling of children's stories.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And Chris Coulter, for those who don't know, and I don't know how you could not know if you
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   listened to this show, he's the founder of Chipotle.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Is that right?
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   [laughter]
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I believe Gutenberg is scholar, Dan.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   He's a Gutenberg scholar, founder of Chipotle.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And, and the best singer on Glee.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Glee?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I guess she's, she's, she's glee-king right now.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   And as we speak, glee-glee-glee-g.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   The show brought to you today.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   It's called the Land Stories Wishing Spell.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Is that what it's called?
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   No, I meant, let me, the chat room has given me a link to the Amazon.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   It has a nice cover.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   The Land of Stories, the Wishing Spell.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   That's kind of neat.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Do you think he really wrote it?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Or they're capitalizing on his fame?
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Looks kind of neat.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Interesting.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Maybe both?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   The children's book, huh?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I wouldn't have, I would have assumed it would be a YA novel, but, hey, eight, eight, eight,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   eight, eight, nine, I'm good for that.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Let me read, let me read a little bit from the prologue.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   The dungeon was a miserable place.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Light was scarce and flicked from the torches bolted to the stone walls.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Fowls smelling water dripped inside from the moat circling the palace above.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Large, oh, the Chris Coulter fan club's going crazy.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   This is, the large rats chased each other across the floor searching for food.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   This was no place for a queen.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   How many times have I heard that?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   [laughter]
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   That's kind of sci-fi fantasy.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   He's a little bit of a geek.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Snow white.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Snow whites in it.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   He's a little bit of a geek.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Okay, he's a geek.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Cakey.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   He's Prince geek.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   And then there's a sixth grade class.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   So, yeah, it's kind of, it's not young adult.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   It's, uh, eight, eight, no, that's about right.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Eight, no, yeah.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   That's good for him.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I'm sure he wrote this.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Why wouldn't he?
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   You know what, Chris, you need a Squarespace site to go.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Squarespace has a big announcement, by the way, brand new service.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   You know what, I'm calling it the new Squarespace.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   You might have heard me talk about it as version six.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Let's just talk at the new Squarespace.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Oh, my golly gosh.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   If you tried Squarespace before, you got to try it now.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Completely new set of code.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Completely new.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   50 plus newer improved features.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Uh, the pricing the same, but boy, you get a whole lot more of these beautiful template
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   designs are just, and they're, by the way, the latest thing, responsive design.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   So when you drag an image in, uh, to your Squarespace gallery, it automatically sizes the image
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   into, I don't know, half a dozen different sizes so that your site looks great on any device.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   So, and it's automatic.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   So if you're on a big screen, you'll get the big picture.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   If you're on a mobile device, like an iPhone, you'll get the little picture.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   They call this in the world of the internet responsive design, and it works so beautifully
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   from PC to tablet to smartphone.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Uh, this incredible layout engine.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   You just slide and push and pull, and you make it exactly yours without any code, without
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   any JavaScript or CSS.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Although if you know JavaScript and CSS, it couldn't be easier.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   They will import all your existing content to saving all the SEO, all the links, all the
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   images, everything, even the comments are preserved.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   And of course, if you have a social media account, it's very easy to incorporate your
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Flickr, your four square, your LinkedIn, your Twitter into this and your Google Maps.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   It is so nice what they've done.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   They, this is, it's interesting.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   This is not a content company.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   It's a content enabling company.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   A company that uses great technology to do hosting, plus the best software in the world
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   to give you the best website you've ever seen.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And it's yours free for two weeks when you visit squarespace.com.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Just click the "Try it" free link.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Actually, it says "get started now."
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Click the "get started" link.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   In fact, they're so anxious to get you to try it.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   When you click the "get started now," it says, "Well, choose a template first."
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Like, you don't even give them any information at first.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   This is just to get you to wet your whistle, so to speak.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Look at that.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   There's a kind of a Pinteresty template called Flatiron.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   So you pick your template.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   This is all before you give it a site name.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Maybe, well, what did I do?
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   And then, then you don't even need a credit card.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   You've got two weeks free to try it, to play with it, to use all the features, get an idea
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   of what squarespace could do for you.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   If you decide to buy, "Oh, you're going to love this part," squarespace has not changed the pricing.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   It's still very affordable.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Now, I'm going to recommend an annual plan.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   I'll tell you why in just a second.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Let me give you the pricing first.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   So it's $8 a month for the basic, the standard.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   $16 a month for unlimited.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Boy, when I say unlimited, $16 a month and you get unlimited bandwidth, unlimited pages,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   galleries and blogs, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   So you can do a blog with a dozen contributors as well.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Really get in the publishing business.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   The best hosting, the best software, $16 a month for unlimited everything.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   And when you use the offer code TWIG 7, you get 10% off your first purchase.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   So make that first purchase a big one that way.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   So make sure your savings.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Really incredible.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Squarespace.com.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Go there.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Give it a shot.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Try it.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Play with it.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   You get to see everything.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   And then if it makes sense to you, and I know it will, use the offer code TWIG 7 when you sign up and you'll save 10%.

[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.360]   it's called who's hard for me to imagine
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.960]   at all it's called politics powered by twitter a new radio format diving in
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.040]   the politics from every angle
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   driven by twitter
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.640]   i used to be the blog guy unpaid i miss n_b_c_s
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.160]   coast to coast with uh... uh...
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.000]   maha krauley and run reagan
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.560]   and i was on regularly all the time and you know they did they do this news
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.360]   they turn and say well jeff
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.480]   what's the blog world saying about this
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.920]   dot com
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.600]   here are three districts
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.280]   and quotes out of context that we absolutely nothing in isolation but
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.720]   we're gonna act hip like we have the blog world
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.800]   and and and and
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.680]   that's the problem with all of this is the way it's the same stuff we see on
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.120]   on t_b_ news with a civil what's twitter saying well twitter is saying
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.040]   this ridiculous thing that makes no sense outside the context of a hundred
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.520]   forty characters i know i'm wondering i mean it what it is sounds like to me
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.680]   is they have an answer is reading tweets
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.720]   but i
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.840]   that can't be sure that discussing them to or something but but she went
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.160]   how much
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:37.320]   you read a treat you said what was jee your army's trending today yes he is
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.680]   is he trying to do as much as he was yesterday i don't know let's try
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.320]   it's a brand new radio format the reports to listeners exclusively what
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.360]   politics are being talked about on twitter including trends and tweets from
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.880]   politics journalists celebrities who have active voices on the key political
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.840]   issues electrical races
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.560]   electrical i'm sorry electoral races and breaking news
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.280]   specifically designed as a daily digest
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.560]   for serious listeners driving home from work
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.640]   politics powered by twitter
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.680]   how do you digest twitter that's like digesting the conversation it's pre-chute
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.960]   it's pre-chute charlie's it's already digested
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.520]   yeah
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.120]   and hard
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.000]   right
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.560]   and it is it is interesting how often you see like on local local news or new
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.200]   stories just being a series of tweets i mean the colorado shooting out that's
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:28.880]   right
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.640]   news was just reading tweets
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.520]   and it was and what frustrated me is that there was one particular that they
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.440]   kept screen-shotting the one from uh... just a redfield saying you know the
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.200]   movie doesn't start for twenty minutes
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.480]   she had replied to a friend who said well why are you know why are you tweeting
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.720]   why are you at the movie
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.480]   but they but the obviously like the news people didn't know how twitter works
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.880]   and didn't acknowledge that she was actually
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.120]   she keeps waiting this she keeps waiting this
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.480]   it is a star for twenty minutes
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.280]   but yeah i don't know if i can handle a whole show
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.160]   just get it's just gonna be kind of the best sound bites from what i don't know
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:06.200]   it's an hour long imagine the poor schmuck's doing it
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.280]   you know i i thought that's why this is the only people like you jeff
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.080]   who got roped into it and they know better
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.920]   they can't go for god for you to read them all
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.520]   on twitter somebody writes
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.520]   british ronnie
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.760]   oh god
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.960]   oh god
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.760]   you want to see a nexus seven commercial
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.760]   do they need to advertise they've are they've already sold out they can't make
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.560]   anymore i'm so happy i have mine
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:42.680]   i have not used my my i've had a week i guess they have the uh...
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.240]   eight
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.080]   eight gig version
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   and frankly i think that's fine if you really want that's a two hundred dollar
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.400]   version but they sold out of the sixteen gig the two hundred fifty to his dick
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.080]   obviously did not predict that the demand which also probably tells me the
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.480]   sixteen is too small self
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.520]   i don't think so i think people assume that it could be such a cloud device i
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.160]   didn't i don't find that
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.720]   here you go i think it's i think it will go ahead
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.520]   go ahead kim
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.800]   no i just in google's mind i feel like it is the way that they pitched it i_o_
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.920]   and and the way that they've pitched in general to them it is a great way to get
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.160]   stuff in the place or but most people are looking at it as like
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.600]   you know a great
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.040]   tablet to throw their music in their own movies on in their own stuff on and so
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.240]   the first time for the sixteen gig because it's a ridiculous why not
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.240]   nearly subsidized price right for a sixteen gig tablet and i bought the
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.200]   sixteen
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.600]   but but yeah let me just check and see
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   i'm curious what the uh... how much of it i've used i don't think i i've got
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.000]   fifty three apps on here i don't think i've
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.560]   and i don't have a whole year of the plane ride yet i think i've been
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.000]   the key to this is a plane ride
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.440]   yeah i got a smaller i've had and i ran out of space on that real fast
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.080]   i have used uh...
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.240]   uh... i have eleven gigs available
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.160]   so you did you you put me on yours for your plane flight
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.320]   you know i don't look a couple of kim the books but i didn't i didn't have a
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.960]   big enough to see
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.600]   and i'm using google music so you i guess you'd want to cash a playlist or two
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.160]   right
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.240]   yet that doesn't use it to smart caching like it's
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.800]   tries to be like a start to listen stream of playlists did it caches ahead
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.240]   right that's nice to grab the rest of it i watched four episodes of the walking
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.920]   dead on a plane ride with the eight gig it
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.440]   there's space left over
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.080]   i mean you you can't put your entire video collection on it
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.680]   but you can judiciously loaded up with enough to to satisfy you
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.520]   uh... yeah i mean i've got two hundred k of audio
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.280]   two hundred fifty seven megabytes of pictures and videos seven sixty seven
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.120]   megabytes of apps
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.320]   total space thirteen point two four gigs available eleven point six two gigs i
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.240]   got tons of space left
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.680]   and i'm using a lot of love this thing
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.420]   i'm just thrilled that google finally has a hit on its hands and i'd like always
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.000]   felt like the nexus was the best and right experience and i wish that google
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.200]   would market
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.840]   the nexus as
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.000]   the google device
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.840]   they don't do it i'm not sure why they don't do it i don't know if they don't
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.360]   want to scare a lot of the else i don't i don't know what but
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.320]   the next experience i love it i love that thing i haven't been able to take my
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.360]   hands off it to i've had it with me
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.440]   back on it
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.040]   if it weren't for the show i i thought maybe trying to do the show on the
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.360]   next is not
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.360]   maybe you have to have to but the rest of the week i'm just traveling with the
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.720]   with the nexus in a keyboard
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.360]   well uh... here's the ad
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.600]   not that they need one
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.400]   but uh... what i think is really most telling is people like m_g_c_ where
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.600]   people who are normally at any knockover normally i've had fanatics and say
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.400]   all there's nothing close
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.560]   at or all you almost to a man saying and a woman saying
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.120]   this is actually really good
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.080]   and
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:47.080]   you can take a camping
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:54.480]   wait a minute
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.520]   hold on there
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.360]   they have wifi at the campsite
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.920]   he waited here

[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.680]   and uh... i guess they're gonna set up a private uh... glass explorer edition
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.960]   on google circle google plus circle with a post update and then
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.520]   yay
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.680]   and jason is our is our glasses are they are attached to your email probably
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.360]   huh
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.320]   so look for an email from google's inviting you to join a fabulous new
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.120]   group
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.880]   for stuff that you can't really use because you won't have the glasses for
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.480]   another year
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.560]   so when apparently this update
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.840]   warning OT update for the galaxy has three disables local search
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:11.200]   is this is some lawsuit crap
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.320]   champs
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.280]   they can see the little android gut spinning you're doing it you can you
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:20.080]   stop the update yet my peril
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.120]   yeah i don't want to know if they have a little tesser act in the androids
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.360]   tummy
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.240]   and it rotates
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.360]   as you say
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.600]   wallets updating
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.040]   uh... well whatever it is i've done it now
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.640]   so that's the that's the lawsuit that for those who don't know it's the
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:41.520]   lawsuit stemming from serie and local search and that kind of thing yeah
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.840]   well that's sucks
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.120]   so you mean what happened there is apple uh...
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.360]   sued
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.520]   and so as a result they're just
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.520]   taking this is the international version by the way so that's why i'm
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.760]   getting this if you have a galaxy s three from verizon or sprint maybe you
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.000]   i don't know why you want but you won't
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.640]   but uh... so uh... the latest OT update
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.960]   does away with you the universal search function which brows is your phone's
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.360]   contact and apps results
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.440]   apple says
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.800]   no you can't do that
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:20.280]   so stupid twenty seven megabytes
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.400]   apple just reached into my phone
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.240]   and squeezed my testicles
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.760]   it
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.680]   uh...
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.400]   that's the i told you i would say the wrong thing today i told you
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.240]   that's me
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.200]   all over
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:37.280]   this is where i say my sex is make my sex is comment it feels like that though
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.480]   it feels like they're just they got me
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.120]   and they're slowly
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.080]   tightening
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:43.920]   uh...
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.840]   sons of beaches
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:52.720]   somebody said sam's on did it not apple i know samsa did it because of apple
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.840]   sam's on did it
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.720]   you know apple did it by proxy
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.560]   i'm moving on that was really depressing what just happened
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.440]   that should not be allowed to happen
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.240]   i guess i could turn it down if i knew what i was doing all the way to me
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:11.480]   was called says no samsa did it because they stole apples technology
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.560]   and it was they had to do that because they were bad
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.040]   people
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:21.680]   the darlach said said would you like to downgrade your phone yeah
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.120]   would you like special steve jobs addition
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.640]   androids operating
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.760]   in less you up unless you download that you can't get jelly bean in the future
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.400]   right now you have to do it
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.560]   now you have to do it understand
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.280]   and this won't happen again this is the european unlocked version that's why
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.600]   happened to me and not you
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:43.080]   i have to be an early adopter and all that
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.760]   the the pc world magazine already with google glass is not even like it's not
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.880]   it's not even a demo
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.920]   and already pc world
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.760]   has an article google glass horror stories
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:59.400]   from your t_v_'s privacy free future
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.160]   uh... obvious crap
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.720]   hahahahahaha
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:08.200]   mark Sullivan writing in pc world calmy paranoid but i think google glass
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.640]   is scary
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.200]   well it uh... is scary are you scared of airplanes airplane are very scary
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.040]   scary
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.920]   yeah
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.760]   google has a man's and mince power
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.320]   mmm just all that standard clap crap
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.920]   a marketer's dream a consumers nightmare
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.960]   you know the device itself is more conservative the most people realize to
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.400]   because in order to take a picture you actually have to press a button
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.400]   right on the top right advisor it's not like you can just look at people go
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.720]   mmm hmm
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.240]   and i think it's really
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.400]   linked
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.800]   yeah i mean it's just as it's just as uh... you know awkward or as uh...
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.440]   interfering as uh... you know japanese camera phone
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.480]   and you know the the device itself what it's showing you is such a small little
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.680]   piece of glass
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:58.160]   in the upper right corner it's it's really not the
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.440]   uh...
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.440]   it's not the like the the altered augmented reality that everyone thinks it
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.080]   is yet it's really like a first step towards that but
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.600]   the device that you know they the designer herself told me that
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.440]   you know they designed these so that people know you're wearing them because
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.120]   it takes a while for society to get used to these new kinds of technologies so
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.440]   i think google more than anybody's aware of the pat the pitfalls of doing this
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.120]   surreptitiously
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.160]   right at his
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.040]   not that people don't give google credit all the time in this case i really
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.600]   feel like people don't give them a little credit for understanding what it's
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.640]   like to put cameras in
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:33.200]   you know everyone's hands and everyone's on everyone's face
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.400]   charge me a little nuts
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.960]   google is seeking campaign money
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.680]   this is there's always crazy money in election years who who how much did so
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.960]   romney's got hundreds of millions of bombers
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.280]   uh... hundreds of millions
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.560]   we're going to be a billion dollar campaign for both probably it's why the
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.400]   country's so screwed up yeah billion dollars
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.600]   and uh...
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.680]   and of course google one of the little bit of that
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.200]   you live in that
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.520]   so they're touting the net as a
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.960]   prime information source forget your
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.760]   television
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:09.920]   this is a google infographic called four screens to victory
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.640]   what they did is for sales it is google dot com slash elections
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.800]   slash ads
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.480]   sure you can have your t_v_ add
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:22.080]   but what about mobile devices other three are and personal computers
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.840]   if you really want to be big this year
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.400]   if you want to be you're the next
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.000]   member of congress
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.800]   uh... i can't quite read it but you get the idea i'm so sick and for graphics but
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.040]   you get the idea i have to i'd say that it's just that it could be said in a
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.320]   paragraph is now said in an acre
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.640]   i saw them for graphic this morning
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:47.040]   since something like if you converted every tweet into pennies
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.040]   it would reach to the moon back it's like what does that mean it means nothing
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.400]   they're not pennies
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.560]   they're not going to the moon
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.680]   what does that mean
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.000]   and it was a picture of earth and the man has nice
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   it was so stupid
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.360]   and it was a five-meg jpeg file it was huge
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.840]   if you converted this jpeg to dollar bills
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.360]   that
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.240]   just to come to your side for the mutation
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.320]   oh my god and that's all my flip-board so of course it's
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.480]   taking over my phone
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.000]   four screens here it is bigger access to political information no longer comes
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.880]   from one place or one screen
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.600]   in just four years since the last presidential election
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.680]   the continued growth of the web and proliferation of smartphone and tablet
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.600]   have radically changed when where and how voters access political news and
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.560]   information
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.360]   tablet ownership has doubled over the last holiday season
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:41.920]   eighty percent of smartphone owners actively use their device while watching
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.520]   television
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.480]   it's because television is so crappy
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.360]   we need something to start with this board
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.920]   oh yeah yeah okay
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.360]   uh... people are so bored by your political ads this fall all of another
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.240]   place to reach them as well exactly
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.400]   exactly they're looking at their phone while your ads going on eighty three
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.840]   percent of mobile phone you were this is interesting
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:09.160]   that this is this is a fact according to the
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:15.400]   eighty three percent of mobile phone owners are registered voters
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.160]   twenty four percent of campaign donors rely on mobile electric and election
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.560]   election information
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:28.560]   adults spend more media time on mobile than newspapers and magazines combined
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.320]   i think this is a pretty compelling case i'm gonna buy some ads
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.960]   they'll be no we want to run for we want to run for president
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.920]   on a no no no we don't want you to run for school board

[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:27.160]   uh... robert luellin
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:31.360]   luellin if i were bobby luellin i'd be pissed i would sue i would say you need
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.820]   to downgrade your show
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:35.400]   because this is exactly what he does he gets people well and now

[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.720]   anyway here's the sign for the parallons of folks wagon and i didn't even know
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.440]   that
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.880]   but i think you see the three cameras paster the windshield yeah i think the
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.760]   dub paid for this
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.320]   what do you think
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.720]   this is nineteen fifty two v_w_ bug
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.120]   in azure blue pretty
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:57.840]   look at that
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.240]   that's the trancy i know and they don't have a uh...
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.520]   cylinder twenty five horsepower and gas meter they have a reserved
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.800]   takwondo because the rear window was made in two pieces to save money
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:12.360]   and it's like me you feel that true humility is always in short supply
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.720]   look at that is the car for you it's hysterical that's our in signal
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:19.720]   it just is a car collector he just got to be able to write it off
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.680]   and go
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.600]   what is that
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.360]   really free
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.480]   c_t_ three cameras and the shield car
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.840]   but yeah i think that the uh...
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:34.960]   gocams where they are the echo can't get a certain and this is completely
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.280]   exactly a popular well and that's it
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.320]   you know he's it's different he has coffee and all
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:46.000]   and i'm bored already this is another show about nothing

[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.760]   he doesn't need the money
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.520]   so why is he doing it
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.960]   and he's a lot of good there's a preview of the next episode there i think yeah
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.840]   Ricky Gervais will be in the next was your base that should be cut yeah
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.200]   always can be hysterical
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.840]   right now
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.760]   where there are a few moments in this world
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:13.360]   always a different car in each one so basically is getting to write off each
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.400]   his entire collection
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.880]   hahahaha
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.360]   uh... says a nice that's a nice twist

[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:40.720]   hahahaha

[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.040]   you probably are not you know maybe you should maybe he will do it
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.360]   2012

[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.760]   should build things out of sugar cubes massive
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.440]   things and then bring them to uh burning man and burn them
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.120]   oh no i may have to start knitting after us but it's a time of this there you go
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:07.200]   knitting yeah somebody else don't you want jina to make
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:11.040]   to make them sweaters for us all yes absolutely
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.200]   here you go the chatroom's got it osmet says knit a banjo then play it
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.960]   there you go perfect multi-talented
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.040]   visio has uh got its pre-order up for the
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.960]   google tv set top box it's cute this is a better than the cue look at this
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.880]   it's called the visio co-star a hundred dollars that's a good price
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.240]   oh
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:36.720]   uh and it's the new google tv experience it's you know it's another one of these
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.640]   set top boxes you do get a remote a little bit more complicated than the apple
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.960]   remote
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:49.680]   it has a but the cue is not a google tv boxes no i know isn't that the i-review
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.880]   no it's not three hundred dollars and and you don't get google tv
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.440]   yeah this uh blue dot that stares at you though
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.440]   yeah i know i know blue dot that constantly judges you while you watch
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.840]   tv
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.440]   for penniless and a benjamin can you tell it's in gadget writing it adds the new
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.240]   google tv experience to your existing setup and brings along its remote with a
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.080]   courty keyboard on the underside integrated IR blaster
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:20.160]   it's a marvel arm processor ready for apps like on live oh that's interesting
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.880]   so you could game with it as well
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.240]   oh this is very tempting this competes directly against the apple tv in the
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.080]   roku
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.920]   august 14th current ship date
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:38.640]   but you can uh you can uh order uh now i'm gonna order one right now
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.720]   i was convinced that my tivo was busted last weekend because i was getting
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.400]   like stuttering every 30 seconds 30 to 60 seconds yeah
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.280]   and uh i mean i tried everything i downloaded something from
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.160]   amazon to check i checked my cable signal everything seemed fine
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:56.000]   i was just about to buy a brand new tivo and i posted a google plus about it
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.360]   and someone said hmm do you have a google tv hooked up to that
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.160]   tivo because that can cause that problem oh no i am
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.960]   plugged the google tv and everything was fine oh that's depressing
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.800]   well it was great that you know the people in my google plus
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.760]   comments saved me a couple hundred bucks yeah yeah okay
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.200]   but and you know once i reset the google tv it was fine i just
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.520]   oh okay so it works now it works now it just was one of those things
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.680]   that i was just like you know i i really i like having a browser on my tv
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.400]   but not if you know not if it's gonna cause
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.080]   well if you can't watch glee right uninterrupted they're gonna do a
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.720]   project they're gonna do a project butter for google tv yeah
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.920]   they need a project butter smooth smooth out all the kinks
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.040]   according to itunar 99 in our chatroom uh the uh
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.000]   sony google tv second generation will be available at 4 p.m. today
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.880]   didn't even know that oh so this is cool the visio co-star they
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.080]   showed it at google i.o i did not get a chance to see it but it looks pretty
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:01.360]   cool uh you could pre-order visio.com/co-star
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.720]   and they've got a pre-order button right on there
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.240]   what did the new google tv look like jina have you i mean it's it's not something
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.480]   we have right the new sony unit well just the new
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.480]   ui oh the new ui yeah i'm not sure i don't think that
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.120]   we've got it i don't think the review you have a review right
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.440]   yeah logitech i don't think that i have a review yeah like you
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:30.560]   hmm 1080p full hd 3d support y5
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.640]   i like how i like how it looks now here's the new google tv experience
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.320]   it looks kind of similar you know i have to say uh given the choice between how
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.400]   apple does netflix and how the logitech review does it i far prefer the
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.640]   logitech review uh the apple the apple's got a brain dead
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.360]   interface they really didn't do a good job
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.720]   it's it's a lot of clicks to get around this
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.960]   look they kind of control the uh remote control has a trackpad on the uh
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:01.840]   visio device holy cow what would you do
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.120]   why do i get this quite a remote control it's a little much and then on the other
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:09.040]   side you got a pretty cute oh there you go
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.000]   so you're guaranteed to push a wrong button no matter where you hold it
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.800]   that is not the most spouse-friendly remote i've ever seen
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:22.240]   there's no such thing well in particular a trackpad and a keyboard on
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:26.240]   oh it's kind of intimidating well this is interesting
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.200]   uh no this is the same as the review it's got
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.160]   hmmi this is one of the things i think i don't know if people understand
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.960]   what's unique about a google tv it's a pass-through device
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:39.680]   so it's an overlay on top of your cable television or your satellite
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.280]   television which i really like so you can get a menu bar your tv continues
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.560]   playing the show you can have a you can do stuff with the tv in the
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.000]   background um picture in picture yeah much nicer than the
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.120]   roku which you know you're either watching the roku or your cable
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.720]   it's a separate device this this is kind of an overlay and so it has the pass
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.200]   through uh to dual hdmi pass through
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:07.920]   802.11 ny5 bluetooth bluetooth hmm and usb ports
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.200]   not sure what you could do with that
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.200]   well they're coming i i don't imagine a remote control that has the old thick
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.760]   pad nipple on it it's only a matter of time
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.560]   nobody uses it but then ten people use it and they always tell you about how
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.040]   great it is yeah we got one here it works here
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.280]   it has to have the nipple without the nipple yeah right there look he's gonna
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:33.280]   pop his head up in a second there he is did you hear him say it's great there
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:37.040]   right there oh they got two of them two hands
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.840]   okay how can we get a straight line i'm gonna get in trouble for it this is my
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.960]   i'm gonna get in trouble now for this week but howard's turn wouldn't go to
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.320]   go to a mac because he liked the nipple too much but of course he did
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.920]   yeah of course he did right of course he did
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.840]   good news sorry i said that right it was the fed of the sorry i apologize good
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:01.600]   news gina maybe for you twitter says we're going to be able to
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:07.440]   uh get your old tweets back someday right now there's a limit of how many
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:12.720]   five thousand tweets back 3200 3200 tweets back
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:18.160]   um so a full history download
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:23.040]   uh such a long time in coming costolo uh decastolo told the new york times
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.000]   the company's building a tool that would let twitter users
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.160]   download their own tweets he says well it's complicated
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.960]   um it's a hard thing to do
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.640]   yeah it's kind of there's a cold storage hot storage issue there i mean they
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.240]   they just offload old tweets onto different storage and in europe right
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.640]   now you can send twitter a letter requesting your archives
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.080]   and after a certain amount of days they'll send them to you in a file
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.840]   uh but um so it sounds like this tool is gonna let you just do that just
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.360]   export your tweets and it's a good step in the right direction
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:59.280]   feature zero something had to do for regulatory reasons
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.360]   i i'm not sure i mean you know this also we've had this conversation like
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.720]   anil and i were joking that we both celebrate you know the yearly holiday
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.400]   when like twitter says they're gonna let you get to your old
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.440]   speech
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:17.200]   belief when we see it but the truth is like this date that this is a data
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.520]   liberation problem it's like okay so i click on an export button and i get
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:26.720]   an XML file or an html file and like what okay like how useful is that to me
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.640]   i can feel good about doing that but you can't search that stuff you can't say
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.520]   hey can you know show me kevin responded to something
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.280]   witty you know in 2009 can i find that you know it's just your old old stuff out
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.240]   of context of the system and it's not search enabled so
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:46.160]   i mean it's it's the first step uh to i think what i think there's a lot of
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.440]   twitter it's concentrates on being what's in the moment right that's always
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.480]   what they've what they've done and and uh so i don't know how
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.200]   if we're ever going to see the ability to be able to search through your archive
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.320]   or search through replies to you on twitter dot go ahead so much functionality
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:02.160]   i mean because because i i my old blog have a pretty
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.120]   things on the blog to save it and delicious that put things into the
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.080]   work but if i knew it were in twitter if i didn't get to it i would use it even
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.440]   more well that's uh good argument for installing
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.640]   think up yes it is one of the reasons i did because you
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.520]   mine all the tweets and all the replies which is great
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:21.040]   other applies all the links all the favorites all your friends
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:25.600]   um you can't go back in time but but from the moment you're running it
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.960]   going forward you're going to have an archive of that right it goes as far
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.880]   back as it can so you start with the 3200 right yeah 3200 tweets
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.000]   and when they do this if they do this you know it
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.560]   sounds like it may be fairly trivial to then just add
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.680]   or added archive back into what you got you may not get the depth that you
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.280]   provide but you get something yeah exactly i mean it's great for it's
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:48.320]   great for us because it means that you hey you can import your tweet and to
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.040]   think up and you know we can maybe do further analytics
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.360]   on it that would be nice yeah yeah that would be really nice
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.080]   yeah that would be great for us i mean we're you know this is this is
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.440]   huge i'm not i'm i'm excited i want twitter to build that
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.920]   functionality and because honestly you know the archiving bit and the
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.120]   capture bit of of think up like that's that was part of my original
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.560]   motivation but i'm ready to we're ready to move it to the next level
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.920]   and and see what interesting things you can do with your data
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.960]   uh central we're working on right now so it's it's for me
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.960]   uh i'm thrilled that we'll be able to get people's whole archive so we can do
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.720]   more interesting things the data rather than just get a csv file out of it
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.040]   and i have for a long time also been running a plug-in on my blog that
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.720]   just makes a blog weekly blog post of my tweets of the week
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.640]   mm-hmm yeah that they're pretty primitive but at least i have it
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.760]   yeah that's a fine way to do it then you have it in more press search or
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.560]   your cms search right um yeah
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:49.360]   and then also it's fun and i have this is something i've had a long time on my
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.240]   blog on this date uh in past years so i you know if there's a
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:58.320]   you know i i can go back to my my tweets from 2008
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:02.080]   yeah that's really fun isn't it on this day in 2008
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:08.320]   i was having a carneas super burrito i just finished Neil Stevenson's anapham

[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.200]   well speaking of psychosis and twitter did you see the story here that there's
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:41.520]   going to be a study out under twitter the old last one in there that um
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.360]   uh is going to they analyze three million tweets
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:50.960]   to try to predict and then they gave psychological test to the tweeters
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.600]   involved and they're going to try to predict psychosis
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.080]   you think if somebody's really crazy that the first thing they're doing is
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.040]   getting on twitter you know in some cases it seems like that
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:05.600]   really they're crazy people on twitter well they're on facebook i know there are
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.840]   crazy people on twitter but i'm just if you're in the throws of
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.760]   psychosis uh yeah i i know this the psychosis is a bit of a
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.400]   joke but it could from your tweets can it
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:23.360]   predict things about your psychology so this is interesting so uh they're
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.560]   going to share this information on uh Defcon on July 29th on sunday
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:34.160]   so we'll find out what they found um should be interesting
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.720]   since the beginning of the year we've been investigating what someone's twitter
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.480]   activity might reveal about their personality
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.560]   oh so they're they're the headline is not exactly what they're up to
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.360]   yeah uh after tweets from celebrities such as
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.360]   steven fry and tony hawk we had over three thousand people take park in our
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.480]   study this is basically what them can't get us doing though
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.760]   i mean you're they only have two thousand nine hundred twenty seven tweeters
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.080]   three million tweets the difference is they gave us a psychological test
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.520]   oh yeah i mean think i was not really trying to
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.160]   suss out your psychology um but we're we're we're working towards sort of
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.440]   this is this opportunity yeah yeah this is the opportunity
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.800]   it is an analysis of your activity but in a
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.400]   the purpose is to kind of help you be a better participant on the network and
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.200]   give you hints about what works and what doesn't and that kind of thing and
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.240]   about relationships that you have you may not have known of
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.400]   um i do think that you that one's tweets to say a lot about that person though
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.160]   so i'm interested to hear what they find out great
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.600]   i thought i thought i was being sneaky and coy
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.520]   [laughs]
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.520]   this is uh caggle.com florida at lantic university
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.280]   and a handful of curious data science well we'll find it on sunday
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.680]   they're going to be looking at psychopathy
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.920]   narcissism and i i'd never heard this term in uh
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:03.600]   psychology for maki avelianism i don't think that's a scientific term
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:09.040]   huh all right something to look forward to on sunday
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:13.680]   youtube and creative commons in bed with one another i think this is a great
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.400]   thing yeah
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.480]   remix the four million creative commons licensed videos on youtube
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.600]   is this what you were talking about
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:29.600]   oh you're you're bandwidth just went all the way
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.840]   he got him all the way back he just sounded like charlie brown's teacher and
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:36.960]   now he's gone i'm sorry oh no no no no i'm coming back
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:40.240]   oh he's coming back there he is oh you fixed it well i don't know did i
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.720]   yeah yeah how'd you do that i turned the video off and on
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:50.080]   amazing amazing amazing so facebook's first
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:55.840]   earning call yay is it has it been three months already
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.920]   um we're going to find out is it today the first earnings call for facebook
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:05.200]   tomorrow what what to look for stocks gone up and down it hasn't
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.480]   gotten past its original thirty eight dollars per share
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:13.360]   um i think we'll be watching ad revenue right to see how they're doing there
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:17.680]   yep some concerned that ad revenue had been bad this year last year and perhaps
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.480]   even going farther back than you know going down every year
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.400]   and of course will zuck appear
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:30.480]   someone who has not been appearing lately in fact he did not appear on the
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:34.960]   recent internet's call for google is larry page he has no voice
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:38.800]   and and and after what steve jobs went through and all the speculation and all
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.680]   the concern and all the news coverage of it i'm surprised there hasn't been more
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.080]   about page he's been it's been very quiet so to speak
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:50.880]   he's he's six and say oh yeah before i owe he lost his voice before i owe and
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:54.800]   they've if not you do the sorry does that have anything to do with the
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.400]   nature of the two illnesses jeff that um people thought that steves was life
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.840]   threatening whereas they just thought that maybe larry's just having a
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.000]   you know extended voice thing but he lives in email and so it's okay
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.960]   uh yeah but isn't i mean i i'm forgetting that was it larry or
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.280]   sarah gay who's doing the genetic research on
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.800]   hereditary you know what it is sarah is in it anyway it's sarah okay i think it is
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:19.040]   yeah right with Parkinson's and all that yeah that's sarah gay right yeah i i
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:23.840]   don't know it's just it's mysterious and and the argument with jobs was also that
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:28.720]   there was a need for transparency um so we don't know what it is
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.960]   oh yeah i don't yeah i mean it could be i mean you could be very very serious
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.360]   it just depends why he lost his voice yeah or whether he's going to get it back
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.000]   it's got to be a problem if you can't be being a CEO if you cannot speak
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.600]   yeah unfortunately the ada does not apply to the stock market
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:50.320]   yeah and i and i i just think that uh after the jobs thing that people are a
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.280]   very a stock look it's a public company uh
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:57.040]   it's it's absolutely germane to the value of the company whether you might
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.560]   want to invest in it if the ceo is ill or not
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.840]   well of course dr mom says in the chat room that she's very concerned about this
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:06.960]   prolonged absence there are no causes of laren jay this would take this
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.240]   long to recover friday it sounds like something much more
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.440]   serious than laren jaynes yeah and maybe i mean i'm i'm concerned too i
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.080]   mean just it's not just about you know the greed of the stock it's it's
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.800]   concerned maybe i have a lot of respect for him and i know it's
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.880]   bad timing i mean he really was on a roll he
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.480]   things were really going and now according to uh
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:32.320]   was it nikesh or uh or or uh he's still running the company larry page is
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.560]   still running the company yeah so you know it is true in this email area you
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.840]   don't have to speak well soon see the google plots as a
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:44.240]   management tool uh senior vice president chief business
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:50.640]   officer google nikesh or rora said during the uh analyst call larry has
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.320]   lost his voice but continues to run the company
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:58.080]   this it does you know what if if the steve jobs thing hadn't happened
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:03.040]   it probably would not be a story but because of that i think this well
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.840]   that's a little odd
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:13.120]   facebook's zuckerberg wins privacy patent
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:16.480]   in great irony
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:21.520]   everyone has to chuckle about it uh it's a patent application from 2006
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:28.880]   governing privacy settings uh patent number 8,225,376
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.680]   a system and method for dynamically creating a privacy summary
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:38.800]   hmm yeah yeah patents are not a measure of
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.240]   quality no and i've been told time and time again
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.360]   you can't read the abstract and have any idea what the patents really for so i
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.400]   won't read anymore
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.880]   you anti-trust case google wants to settle it
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.640]   google bought sparrow i'm pissed off did you
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:01.920]   does anybody use a mac anybody uses sparrow love sparrow i'm sorry to
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:04.720]   priority a box could you use priority boxes well
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.240]   what's nice about sparrow yeah it's kind of a gmail but it's a uh
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:12.400]   desktop and iphone interface to gmail it's better than gmail which is why google
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.160]   bought it uh because they want to i'm sure incorporate
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.760]   those features into gmail
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.960]   all right we're gonna let's see uh yeah i think we could take one more
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:27.040]   issue here one if i may go ahead uh gordon crowwitz at the wall's
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.160]   regernal uh in his last column and gordon's a very nice guy by the way i know
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:34.000]   him wrote a uh a column that should have gotten some editing man
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.800]   arguing that the government had nothing to do with the creation of the internet
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.960]   and there are three or four great corrections out uh right now one of the
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.680]   la times uh and some others and then vince surf moments ago uh it was
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:50.080]   interviewed at cnet and came out and said this is uh a bunch of hooey
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:53.840]   because guess what he should know i was there
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:57.920]   he said quote finthrop said i i would happily fertilize my tomatoes
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.200]   with crowwitz's assertion
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:05.920]   basically said that the invention of ethernet was the invention of the
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.360]   internet yeah well that's completely wrong by mexcath
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.080]   yes uh yeah okay so all you had to do if you wanted to bunk this is re katie
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.080]   haffner's incredible book where wizards stay up late that talks about
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:23.280]   uh DARPA and uh and james lick lighter who was a federal
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.440]   government employee who said hmm we want these two computers to talk together
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:33.520]   went to bbn which was a private business and said figure this out
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.360]   but it was funded by the government it was primarily used by the government
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:42.400]   and the nsf and anybody who's less than 12 years old may remember
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.480]   when the nsf finally said and i think it was 94
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.960]   that you could have commercial traffic on the internet and everything changed
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:55.120]   it's crazy to say that it wasn't i don't know where this
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:59.440]   that's talked about revisionist history you can revise history but not something
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:03.840]   that happened in our lifetime it's it's arguing against big government
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:08.320]   i think the government is not an an an obama yeah it's it's like the the guy who's
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:11.120]   doing the ads for mit romney uh the self-made
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:14.720]   guy who they just really recently realized that he in fact took a million
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.800]   dollars in government loans to self-made
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:21.200]   businessman yeah show the plumber moments yeah
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:25.680]   twitter uh i got one more twitter twitter's because the olympics
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.480]   yeah this is cool we're excited we're going to watch the opening ceremonies
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:32.080]   on friday right i'll be watching non-stop tv with my
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:36.720]   cell phone and my nexa seven in hand in case i get bored
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.600]   glee with sweat
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:44.560]   uh they're going to light up the london i
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.080]   and twitter this video is no longer available because the youtube account
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:51.360]   has been terminated due to multiple third party notifications of copyright
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:59.360]   infringement
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.240]   it seems to be having a lot lately
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.640]   okay so the sentiment as in it's just going to be a different color
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:12.880]   it's going to be a giant mood ring off twitter of twitter oh me
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.360]   so kara swisher tweeted that during the week and she said what
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.720]   other you know monuments could you imagine with this and so i imagine
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:21.760]   waking up every day to see the empire state voting and saying oh
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.200]   new york's in a bad mood today i understand it
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.040]   so i i should we should explain that london i is a giant ferris wheel that
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:32.640]   dominates the skyline of london
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.960]   what i really like to see is uh big bend tweet like have like you know like
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.600]   have the l_a_d_ if the long long long long
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:47.040]   yeah so i don't know exactly i mean what is the what is the mood going to be
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:52.000]   angry i know well but but but twitter does have
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.280]   moods that's that's the i've talked about the story on on the show before
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.120]   the um the university of indiana thai this who found that they could predict
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.760]   the daily ups and downs of the dow jones with more than 90
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:06.240]   accuracy through six moods in their opposites on twitter
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:10.640]   and and jonathan harris magnificent magnificent artist and programmer and
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.800]   developer is something called we feel fine which was with blog mentions before
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:19.760]   twitter was there and he tracked moods on on on blogs
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.800]   and statements i feel good i feel bad uh through uh times of the year times of
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.800]   day age geography all kinds of things so yeah there actually is kind of an
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:32.480]   aggregate mood that moves on twitter which is
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.560]   pretty darn cool i joked to that that you could probably do it to the gold
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:39.920]   estate bridge in san francisco but of course that would always be happy
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:46.080]   actually i talked to somebody who's uh uh local person who's doing a
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:51.360]   led 20 000 led light show on the bay bridge in san francisco
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.840]   it's gonna be six month temporary installation i don't know if it'll be
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.960]   tied to twitter but it's going to be doing stuff
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:00.080]   so that's kind of we feel fine that wasn't that the one that uh
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.600]   yes we've defined uh it's um yeah it was real
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.840]   and and by the way big ben does have a twitter feed did you see that oh yeah
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:12.640]   yeah bong bong bong bong bong bong it's hilarious
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.240]   bong bong bong bong so the london i sentiment thing is
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:19.840]   uk based tweets so every time england loses we can watch it
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:25.360]   you know turn the throttle for sad oh well what did it here so here's a deal
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:29.600]   every night there's a 30-minute light show just so you know here's the code the
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:34.000]   i will glow yellow if england is in a good mood
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.640]   purple if it's in a bad mood and green if it couldn't care less
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:43.600]   huh those are not very intuitive colors okay no
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:48.480]   they was really cheap LEDs i'm gonna do a few colors yellow
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:53.680]   for happy all right bong bong bong bong
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.760]   we'll be back with our tool our tip and our number of the week
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:03.200]   kevin perdy from complete android guide dot com
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.200]   kev jeff jarvis from buzz machine dot com and smarter word dot orgs
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:12.160]   jeanor to panny are here but first a word from carbonite the best way to back up
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:16.560]   if you if you had a design uh a backup
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.200]   strategy you would be looking for something that was automatic so you didn't
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.800]   have to remember it would be continuous so anytime you make a change it'd be
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.640]   backed up you wouldn't have to think about it
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:28.000]   and here's the cool part it would be online
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.320]   off-site so if the worst happened and everything got you know fell apart you
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.800]   always have a copy in the cloud cop uh secure copy by the way you could in
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.600]   fact use strong encryption on it and only you have the key
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:45.360]   uses ssl this is carbonite carbonite is automatic continuous online backup
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:49.040]   for fifty nine dollars a year per computer that's less than five bucks a
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.080]   month for everything on your computer you got more than one computer got
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.280]   external drives you got plans for that small businesses they have a plan for
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:59.840]   that you've got to visit carbonite dot com this is the way to back up once you
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:03.600]   put it on your machine you just forget it mac or pc just forget it
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.720]   it's backing up and you always can get your data in fact you can check your
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.120]   data and this is something i actually add as a
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.000]   additional criteria and i don't trust a backup where i can't see
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.640]   what was backed up you can log on to your carbon account anytime on any computer
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.760]   even on their free smartphone and tablet apps and there's your stuff
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.600]   and you can open it and download it just like it it's cloud storage
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:27.600]   so i love that carbonite dot com steve gibson said it does
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:33.200]   conform to his trust no one criteria for security for safety i just think it's
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.000]   fantastic you don't need a credit card for the free trial you just need our

[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:54.800]   great peace of mind thing especially for a laptop especially for a kid going

[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:02.800]   i got a laptop and then put carbonite on carbonite dot com use our offer code
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:06.480]   would you twig oh somebody gave me the london i video
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.840]   yeah i just wanted to let me just let's just see what this looks like
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:13.920]   the london thank you london bob for that london bob this account has not yet
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.680]   been shut down although our show probably will
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.880]   so that's what it that's the light show it does every night
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.680]   and if it's yellow then london is happy i'm amazed that they put
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:31.600]   allowed that in london to be honest it doesn't it seem kind of cheesy
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:36.000]   when you're there no one's kind of it's okay yeah they got one in paris to it
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.640]   in the you know in the i've ridden the eye and it's a really it's a really neat
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:44.160]   ride it does seem disproportionately large it's huge
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:47.120]   from yeah from the ground but it's a really cool thing to ride
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.520]   i hate hi is it's your chuff?
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.400]   second well the one the one in new york was going to be at this white elephant
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.080]   mall we have a new jersey called zenadu good i was one of i was one of the
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.640]   bidders to to uh take over and change that whole mall but we lost for political
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:04.640]   reasons but yes there was a spot outside for a gigantic thing like that
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:08.560]   you're trying to buy a mall i was involved in the team
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:13.520]   that was trying to get them all to change the entire concept of retail
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.760]   you're such a mover and shaker it's it's what we google do
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:21.440]   somebody came to me and said uh this is exactly compatible with my idea
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:25.040]   how to how to revolutionize retail and turn it into something entirely
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:28.480]   different and i love disruption so i got involved so
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:31.040]   probably don't somewhere else i'll tell you about it when that day comes
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.800]   the the um what do you call it gondola over the Thames
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.080]   broke that just makes my palm sweat i just hate heights
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:41.440]   wings like what do you mean broke did people fall tumble into the water
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:43.200]   they were stuck up there i would be i would be i would
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.600]   stuck so that said my heart medication up
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:49.200]   [laughter]
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:53.520]   uh jina trapani let's start with you your tool and you have many i'm sorry
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:56.640]   i do the tools you do the tips your tip of the week
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:00.400]   tip of the week is uh duck duck goog.com
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:05.440]   wait a minute duck duck goog. Kevin's happy because
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.640]   Kevin loves duck duck go so we've talked about duck duck go here
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.200]   on site right it's kind of an alternative search engine
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:15.760]   it's kind of a nerdy search engine it's got this um this bang syntax and by
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:20.480]   bang i mean um exclamation point so if you if you go to duck duck go and you
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:24.560]   search say exclamation point i am db and put in a search term
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.800]   it'll automatically redirect your search directly to i am db and that works for
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:33.040]   dictionaries and wikipedia and flicker and life hacker
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:37.200]   and their users submitted shortcuts duck duck goog
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:41.120]   mashes up the two so you can bang you can bang search through duck duck goog
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:44.000]   and if you don't bang search then it just shows you regular google search
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.800]   results so is this from duck duck goog duck duck duck
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:51.440]   duck duck goog. So duck duck goog is basically an
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:55.440]   interface that mixes it either goes to google search results or duck duck go
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:59.120]   results depending on how you search whether you bang it cool yeah yeah you get
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:04.080]   all the cool search shortcuts the bang shortcuts of ddg or duck duck go
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:07.120]   but also the regular google search results depending on how you search
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:10.560]   and but is it the same company or is it just some guy who wrote an interface
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.280]   uh i think it's just some guy huh i think it's something i think yeah
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:19.280]   and uh and there's a link on the front page to add it to your browser tell your
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:22.240]   browser oh yeah so if you've sort of taught yourself
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:25.040]   those bang searches which i have because i've been using duck duck go pretty
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.560]   religiously um it's it's nice because you can
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:33.520]   you know bang search anything but then also just get google search results
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:40.000]   it's a little nerdy but so bang the duck slowly
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.520]   i think you might have a show title
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:52.640]   searches google and bangs duck duck go bang the duck slowly
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.840]   kevin do you i could give you a chance if you have a tip you would like to
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:00.400]   share maybe an android tip i i do um leo do you have a
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.000]   galaxy nexus or your nexus seven handy i do
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.680]   all right um so normally you would turn it off by holding down the power button
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:11.360]   yes that's what i do unlock it yes and then you'll see the
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:14.320]   options to turn off yeah oh if you keep holding it down you get
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:18.080]   additional options right wait a minute well yeah so let's do that
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:21.920]   again so you're saying if i hold it now i can airplane motor silent mode you
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:24.960]   mean that right but instead of tapping power off
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:30.640]   hold down on power off okay that's what i'm getting i'm getting this special
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.000]   menu right okay yeah if you hit you hold down on power off you hold your
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.040]   finger down i'm still holding it like tap and hold like the
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:43.280]   the screen not the oh oh this okay oh reboot to safe mode
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:48.880]   yep so safe mode in android 4.1 so all 12 of us can use this
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:52.720]   um so if you you can reboot into safe mode and that is
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:56.480]   i'm almost ashamed to say it's kind of like windows safe mode um
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:01.680]   all simple mac mac windows slash android ios comparisons
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:04.720]   aside um safe mode literally just reboots your phone
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.120]   with only the core services running so instead of so if you think something
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:12.640]   slowing down your phone or you want to like you know kind of get rid of the
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:15.280]   app that's you feel is taking over your android
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.760]   which hopefully should happen less for the newer versions but
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.040]   anyways you can reboot your phone in safe mode and it literally just you know
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:24.240]   calling texting and the core google services
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:27.760]   and it's a really great way to just like see what your phone could run like
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:31.920]   without any third party apps going so you know a little bit of self-shod
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.640]   and Freud but also um you know troubleshoot stuff that uh you think is going
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.400]   wrong i'm a good thing to see how your battery life is running a day without
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.880]   anything installed on it or whatever you know or as you run
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.640]   short battery i think it would be a good way to to
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:48.640]   conserve yeah maybe conserve yeah so so i just did that now i'm in safe mode it
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.760]   says safe mode in the lower left of the screen so i know
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:55.840]   and the ever no widget has stopped that's right because i but now the apps
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.680]   aren't gone i could still run third party apps but the widgets are gone
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.600]   right well and in the background there's nothing running that is nothing running
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:07.040]   core phone you know in your case tablet phone got it so and the next time you
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:11.680]   reboot it goes back to normal but cool that's very handy so when i'm gonna
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:15.440]   hold the on off button press and hold power off and you'll get the option for
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:19.040]   the safe mode yep it's a safe mode cool and that's
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:24.000]   nexus only uh it's 4.1 only 4.1 only okay whenever
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.600]   phones get 4.1 they'll get that option okay so i'm gonna shut down and turn it
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:32.000]   back on jeff Jarvis your number of the week uh well i could do the fact that
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.520]   zinga's stock is down to three dollars but i was gonna show one got zinga
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:38.960]   zinga's in note wow so instead i'll say that a facebook
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.600]   now has 50 million users in india alone up from 8 million in 2010
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.920]   but there's but there's a billion people in india right there's a ton it's
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.320]   getting there fast the interesting thing to me is that the
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:54.480]   as majority of them come on through mobile and so the international usage is
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:57.680]   really gonna push facebook to get its mobile act together
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:03.520]   mmm very interesting my tip is uh my tool is
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.640]   something i saw in life hacker this week and jeff you tried it and you weren't
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:10.160]   able to get it to work i got no i worked it's working now it's called friday and
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:14.000]   i think this is i think that this there's a lot of stuff that's kind of
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.960]   we're gonna see that it's kind of google now ish
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:20.160]   um so i don't have google now on this phone because i don't have jelly bean
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:26.000]   on their google now uh kind of collects a bunch of cards from a variety of
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.240]   different sources and makes a single page with some interesting information on
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:35.120]   your search page this is called friday by dextritts called forget
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.800]   to remember and what you do is you hook it up to
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:42.400]   everything like your email your facebook your twitter and all that stuff
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:46.560]   and uh and it gets information and creates these pages of all the stuff
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:50.640]   that you've done so now here's the deal i can now search it now i've only just
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:54.320]   started using it but if i could say oh i remember i had a call a couple of days
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.600]   ago with this person or that person i could search through the friday
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:02.560]   database that has been created and find i can also post
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.240]   uh little notes in here and you see it's kind of four-squareish
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.960]   have different activities maybe more gawala ish tv watching music listening
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.000]   reading i have a great idea i could post that
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.360]   that will become part of the database i continue to share that
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.120]   twitter facebook and uh four-square i think this is kind of an interesting
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.720]   idea it would be a lot more useful it was integrated into the phone as opposed to
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:27.600]   a separate stand-alone app but it does run apparently all the time
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.640]   i can even warp back in time we were talking about time hop
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.840]   uh to a previous date that i have been using this
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:37.280]   and since it's gone through my database of tweets and so forth
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:42.240]   i might be able to go pretty far back uh no results found i guess not so
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.400]   you know it's going to get more useful as you use it
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:48.480]   and kevin pretty was saying oh this is a typical of a whole bunch of a whole
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:52.720]   category of apps where a guy don't follow me right the app to collect the
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:57.120]   data and says don't worry we'll figure out what to do with the data afterwards
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:00.560]   uh i just like the idea that i can go back and search that and that's the idea
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.960]   and if it makes you uncomfortable at all i think it's one of the best
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:06.400]   their their policy privacy statement is very very good and also leo if you click
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:10.160]   on the little three three dots in the app you'll see one option there to just
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:13.680]   wipe user they make it incredibly easy that's right
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.640]   to just right never mind you can also do some filtration so i can say what shows
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:23.680]   here you got everything and uh i can see what filters i've got
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:27.040]   i think they've done a very interesting job
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:30.880]   friday a personal assistant they say that learns all about you
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:33.680]   and could tell you anything you need to remember it i think we're getting very
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:37.200]   close to the idea of and it was gordon bell i think
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:40.720]   uh with his met what he called his memo box where he had a camera around his
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.440]   neck all the time was just recording everything he did
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:47.840]   and uh and that data and it's it's what you said kevin
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.160]   we'll just collect it because you'll find a use for it
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:54.880]   later it's same idea in some ways as uh as a jina's app you know
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:00.960]   so it says journal answers analytics self discovery friday for androids
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:04.800]   only for right now very interesting app certainly worth
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:08.480]   taking a look at so why is it called friday because it's
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:13.760]   forget to no friday remember is it's your man friday it's your girl friday
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:18.880]   it's your assistant in a box i get it get it
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:22.800]   now i see they have other apps too that they uh
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.680]   they do there's one called trails i guess remembers what trail you've been on
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:32.320]   all right we're out of time but i thank you all for joining us uh kevin perdy
