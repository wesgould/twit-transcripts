[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Stacey Higginbotham is here, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   So is Kevin Marks visiting us.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We're going to talk about the latest craze with all the cool kids.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Mastodon Kevin will explain what it means and why it's not a Twitter killer.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Why is Jeff Bezos cashing in all of that Amazon stock?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I'll give you a hint. It involves...no bathrooms.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   [Laughs]
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Is that a hint?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And why is Google buying a billion dollars worth of LG OLED displaces all coming up next on Twig?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   [Music]
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Netcast you love.

[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google at the show.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Wow, we got a good show today for you.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We talk about Google, the Googleverse, Facebook, Twitter, what's going on in the world around us.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And the birthday girl is here, Stacey Higginbotham, working with us on her 30th birthday,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   and I'm really honored Stacey that you would be here.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Okay, I'll fess up. It's actually my 39th birthday.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   No, really?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Oh, really?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   You really actually look much younger. I would not have guessed that.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   You look fabulous and happy birthday to you.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And I told Karsten, you know, give her the day off, but you thank you for being here.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I know you're going to a nice dinner with your family. You've already had cake.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   A lot of cake. And I am hoping to get you guys to sing Happy Birthday to me because I think it'll be awesome.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Well, definitely happen. And now that we can without paying license fees.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Right.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   We don't have to sing that fake Happy Birthday song they do at the restaurants.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Also with us, Jeff Jarvis, he's in town.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Nice.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Great to see you, JJ. We missed you.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Did you have a nice trip to where were you, Germany?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   LaRougeau.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Oh, yeah, you went to Italy?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   The International Journal of College.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Stacey and I were so jealous. Matthew Ingram was there too.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Good bye.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Beautiful little town, Parisia.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   It is.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   You been there?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   No, but that's where they send my sister went there.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   That's where they send the exchange students to get educated into the ways of the Italian culture before they let them loosen this in the country.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   They have a very good language school there.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And also great to have Kevin Marks, who has relocated to a comfy couch.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   In the United Kingdom.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Somewhere in the north of England.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Wow.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   North Yorkshire.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Yes.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   That is nice.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   So you don't get to see the outside here in my face.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's too late.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   You don't have to run the show like five hours earlier.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So it can be light outside.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Yes.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Like 10 p.m.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It's 10 or 11.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I apologize.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   We had no idea.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   No, I thought you were just boy.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   This is a trip going on forever.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I'm going to take the hat.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I left a hat on Jeff.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   That's really not.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I'll wear it.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   This is my Westworld man in black hat.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Oh, that is nice.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   That's because it's raining here in Northern California.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   So how far are you from what will soon be the border wall to Scotland?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It's about 150 miles to Scotland.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   But yeah, there's an audio ball there that was put up by Hadrian.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Stay on the Romans.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   If you'd only kept it.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   That was the perfect Kevin slap.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Oh, you mean Hadrian's wall?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So, so much to talk about.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   We have one priority before anything else.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Yes.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   We have to say happy birthday.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Don't we?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Should we do that now?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Well, I think Stacy should show her videos.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I think Google won unquestionably over Amazon.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   What videos are we talking about?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You would have to go to Twitter to see them.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And I'm not sure if you're prepared for this Leo.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I don't use Twitter.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   You know that I'm a Mastodon man.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   You're all in on Mastodon.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I wouldn't be able to post this to Mastodon.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   But I did a comparison of the Amazon Echo seeing Happy Birthday to me and Google Home.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And they're somewhat different.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Let's try it.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Let's see.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Here you go.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Let me turn on the audio though.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Happy birthday.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   If you'd like, I can sing to you.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Just ask me to sing Happy Birthday and we can celebrate this special day with song.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Sing Happy Birthday.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   She has quite a nice voice.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Oh, just wait till Google gets.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I see a cheater.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Would have been really impressive.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Are those all recently happy birthday Stacy?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   No, those are pretty acorns that my daughter collected in this night.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   A lovely crystal bowl.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You know, well, here in Petaluma, the Indians, the locals used to, they lived on acorns.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   They would grind them up and we have lots of acorn.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   It's my birthday.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Pestles, pestles, mortars and pestles.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   You can dig them up and that's what they lived on.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   So grind it up.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   It's delicious.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Oh, it's my birthday.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Well, Happy Birthday.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I hope you have an amazing day.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Oh, thank you.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Sing Happy Birthday.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Happy Birthday to you.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Happy Birthday to you.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Wow.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Yeah, that one was amazing.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Yeah, that one was amazing.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Yeah, that one was amazing.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Wow.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I also enjoyed the most amazing person in the universe, because I never do that.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   That's pretty nice.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Is that when you told it to go?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   No, I was hoping it would say, because I've taught it how to say my name, but it doesn't
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   matter.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Tom, I don't know if it's Simonite, Simonite over at MIT Tech Review.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   He's an editor over there.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   He told Google Assistant, it was his birthday, and he got an anchorman poster that said Happy
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Birthday, Tom, you beautiful bastard or something like that.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It mailed it to him?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Whatever.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I did it.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Let's see if it'll show you what it gave me.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.600]   That's also on Twitter, but it gave me Happy Birthday Stacey, and it has this super purple
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.000]   pink flower cake thing.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Oh, because it knows you're a woman.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.600]   I think it just found a Stacey, Happy Birthday, but Google normally thinks I'm a man, because
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.000]   of the types of sites I go to.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And Stacey could be either, right?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   You can't tell.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Or you could be both.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   There would be nothing wrong with that.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I, for one, celebrate gender dysphoria.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Where is it?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I shouldn't have said that, should I?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   I shouldn't have said that.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I don't see this reputed tweets, because I've been searching Twitter.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   So I don't see this picture.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.040]   But I do see an article you wrote for the technology review that I think is quite interesting.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.280]   So one of the big stories this week is that Plume is raising money.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280]   A lot of money.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.000]   This is one of the mesh Wi-Fi players, $27 million at least.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I think it might have been $37, wasn't it?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.400]   It was going up.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.000]   And interestingly, that the lead investor turns out to be guests.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Comcast.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Comcast.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Now, I happen to like the Plume.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   In fact, that's what we use at home now.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.040]   And it made sense for me because at $79 each, it can add up quite quickly to a very expensive
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.000]   Wi-Fi, but it works so it's like, OK.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   It's $49 each.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   It seems like I paid more than that.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Anyway.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Yeah, the three pack originally was more, I think.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.400]   But, yes, the thing they're doing that's interesting, so there's like the traditional mesh Wi-Fi action
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.000]   that's happening and everybody's doing TP-Link just actually introduced some today.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Yeah, everybody.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Links is TP-Link, of course, there's Eero, which kicked the things off.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Luma.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.200]   Luma, Luma, Luma, did ever come out?
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.720]   It did come out.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   It exists.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   Linksys has Velop.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.720]   Velop.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.160]   The Orbi, which isn't technically mesh.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.120]   The Amplify, which from Ubiquity, the company that really invented this way back when for
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   Enterprise.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.800]   But after trying a bunch of them, and I don't know if the wire cutters yet made their pick,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.880]   but I just kind of know.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.880]   They picked the Orbi.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.080]   Okay, as the fastest.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.520]   And that was my experience as well.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.520]   It was really fast.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.440]   But it's not a mesh.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.440]   But it's not a mesh.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.920]   So they call it the best Wi-Fi mesh networking kit for most people.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   Yes.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.160]   The Anet gear Orbi, which is interesting.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:17.520]   I got great results from the Orbi, but I like the idea of the plume being in every room.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.880]   And they manage everything in the cloud.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.840]   So what's happening there is it's, they're really going to be trying to give you Wi-Fi
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.640]   as a service and have it truly adapt to your home in ways that the Eero might do with over
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.800]   the air software updates every now and then.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   But they're going to be doing it.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.720]   The plume is going to be trying to do it on the fly.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.200]   So it's a slightly different kind of model.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.040]   They're also cuter and you plug them into the wall.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.960]   So you have less choice about what the Google one did.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.320]   And that's why it fell over when some site with Google went down.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.320]   It fell over?
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.320]   Do you remember?
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.960]   You talk about the on upper the Google mesh.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:02.200]   Yeah, the Google the Google the Google on hub where it managed to to brick itself and
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.680]   you had to restart it and we log in because it got a configuration from the net.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   Two months ago.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.680]   Oh, yeah, I do.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.480]   I know now when you said fell over, I pictured it falling off a desk.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.480]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.440]   I'm like, I got you now.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.920]   I do remember, I don't remember the cause.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.520]   But I bet you're right.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.840]   So Jim Salter, who you actually had on the new screensavers to talk about the various
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.080]   ones was test testing network engineers.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.640]   He really tested these and he has the same conclusion I do, which is there isn't one
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   perfect one.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   It really depends a lot on your house.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:42.720]   For instance, he says for a bigger house, the earows better because it's satellites could
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.480]   talk to one another instead of having to talk to the base and you can add units.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.080]   But it didn't have the raw signal strength of the Orbi, which I experienced or the amplify
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.600]   HD.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.840]   On the other hand, he thought the amplify HD was the slowest of the bunch.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.560]   So it's really kind of a confusing space.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.480]   But you have an interesting theory about why Comcast is putting so much money into plume.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:11.360]   Well, when I talked to plume CEO, I met him here in Austin before they launched.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.960]   So a while back, very smart man.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:22.520]   But he talked about is he wanted to be able to eventually charge people for SLAs on their
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.080]   Wi-Fi essentially.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.800]   And the hope was that ISPs would pay plume for this to manage all the Wi-Fi networks
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.720]   for them, or they would pass that on to their subscribers.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.760]   SLAs stands for service level agreement.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.720]   You're seeing a guaranteed level of service quality of service.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   Right.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.560]   Because they can do all that in the cloud, they can actually, it's software defined.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.120]   So they can partition out enough bandwidth for your television, for example.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.600]   And that's really a compelling offering for service providers because a, you know, when
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:02.320]   you pay for broadband and cable from Comcast, you certainly want it to work on your television.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.720]   But it also, as they're bringing in all these devices in the home, they want to be able to,
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.440]   if they sell you a doorbell, they want to guarantee Wi-Fi getting all the way out to
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440]   your doorbell.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   And this is a good one to do it.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.520]   It's one of the reasons I end up using mesh because I want my ring to be accessible out
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.720]   of the doorbell.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:25.400]   But I like the idea of small pools of Wi-Fi per room pools because if I look at my, you
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.160]   know, when I use insider or some other tool to look at my Wi-Fi, the 2.4 gigahertz band,
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.560]   I'm seeing somebody's printer.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.000]   We live, we don't live next door to anybody.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.680]   They're at least several hundred feet away.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:42.000]   I see printers, routers, I see all sorts of stuff because everything, all the Wi-Fi gear
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   now has been turned up.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.320]   There's more power.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.080]   So but the 5 gigahertz bandwidth, which doesn't travel as well, doesn't go through walls as
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.360]   well, is clear, is clean.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.240]   So I like the idea of a 5 gigahertz router that automatically picks that channel if it
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.240]   needs to.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.400]   And all of the mesh routers do a good job of that.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   Much better.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.480]   They're all, all at least dual band, some are tri-banded.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.480]   The challenge with...
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.560]   Go ahead, Kevin.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:14.360]   So the 2.4 gigahertz has trouble with microwaves and water and things, whereas the 5 gigahertz
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.320]   is clear enough for that.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.560]   So the travel further thing depends on what else is around.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.200]   Well, the higher frequency though is more hindered by things in a way, right?
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   So, but it depends what they make.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.520]   Because basically the 2.4 gigahertz is a resonance frequency of water molecules.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.280]   So if you're trying to put it for rain or anything that has a high amount of water in
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.280]   it, then...
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.280]   Interesting.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.280]   Interesting.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.880]   There's an issue in San Francisco.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.880]   One of the...
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.720]   I can't remember which one it is, but one of the networking companies there uses Wi-Fi
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.240]   network bridges.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.520]   And when it's foggy, the bandwidth goes down.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.520]   Wow.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.840]   Well, but see, that's why I like the plume model.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:58.480]   As long as they can talk to one another and then create these little pools of Wi-Fi, you're
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   almost always next to the router because there's one in every room.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:06.760]   So you're never more than 10 feet from a router, which works quite well, I think.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:12.480]   So their plan, and I'm sure Comcast plan is to be part of the deal.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:19.360]   Like when you get a Comcast cable modem, you'd get the plume routers.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.360]   That would be good.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.600]   That would be good.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.600]   And they actually Comcast...
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:30.240]   I think it was at CES this year, they introduced a new cloud-based Wi-Fi program that they got
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   when they bought a company.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.480]   I think it was called PowerDog.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:40.200]   A few years back, and PowerDog was actually a really early company doing better Wi-Fi
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.480]   before it year-old, before all these other guys.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.720]   So Comcast has think it hard.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:51.600]   I mean, we can talk about its regulatory positions, but from a technology perspective,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   they have really good engineering staff and they look ahead at CES.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:00.040]   They need to because their business, which was the old ditch-digging business of bringing
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:05.360]   television into people's homes, is faltering in the internet era, right?
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.600]   Well, they charge you for the routers every month.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.760]   I mean, just the whole idea of, "Oh, I get my show time from Comcast.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.720]   That's going away now because of over the top."
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   I'm looking at...
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.480]   I've been playing with YouTube TV, we talked about it last week, but I just love YouTube
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.280]   TV and I can see this being for a lot of people.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.000]   It's got a built-in DVR.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.520]   It doesn't have a huge selection of stations as we mentioned, but it's getting more.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.960]   This is an example of where over the top is going.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.520]   How long before Comcast just gets kicked out of the house except you still need a nice
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.520]   period?
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.520]   Well, they're talking about doing their own.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.720]   I think they have a story on here that I'm doing.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.720]   They are talking about it.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:51.640]   You know why I didn't really highlight this story because they said sometime, maybe next
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.800]   year, I mean, it's like...
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.560]   They own NBCU.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.560]   So they...
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.560]   Well, they have...
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.160]   They're biggest challenges going to be making sure the FCC doesn't, you know, castigate them
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.480]   for it, but this FCC is probably going to be like, "Yeah, go for it."
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.880]   No, the fact they've already telegraphed that, right?
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.600]   Go ahead, zero rate all you want.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.280]   So Comcast is going to do an OTT service over the top service.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.440]   It's kind of weird in competition with itself.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.840]   It's not though because like it's a different...
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.320]   My parents are probably never going to get rid of cable television.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.120]   But my daughter is never going to subscribe to cable television.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.120]   Right.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.720]   That's why I thought YouTube TV was such a good play because that gets the YouTube generation,
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.720]   right?
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.720]   Yes.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.720]   Comcast has...
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.520]   Does have this stream already.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.040]   I have the Comcast stream and like cable box.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.040]   But it...
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   You can't tell us...
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.680]   I mean, how do you know what's the internet?
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   I mean, it's not...
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.560]   It's just in the cable box.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.200]   Most people I would think would like to get rid of Comcast if they had a better choice
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.480]   for Internet service provider they would.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.400]   So that's my point is that Comcast is smart to make itself a better Internet service provider.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.640]   That's clearly what's on the table.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.800]   At least that's my fault.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.400]   Okay, we're boring everybody.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.560]   Interesting story from Forbes, Google apparently.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.360]   Actually, this originally came from South Korea's electronic times.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:28.200]   He's trying to make a massive $880 million mega deal with LG to secure a large supply
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.720]   of what everybody wants these days, flexible OLED displays.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.640]   We know Samsung has a deal with Apple for 93 million displays for new iPhones.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.200]   Samsung kind of has the lock on OLED displays and has for a long time.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:49.360]   But what's interesting is these flexible OLED displays are used in mostly bezel-less phones.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.840]   This is the future of phones.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.640]   The Samsung Galaxy S8, which comes out in a week, week from Friday.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.880]   The rumored iPhone for late this year.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.600]   All bezel-less screens.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:07.200]   So when you look at the current pixel, it's going to look pretty darn antiquated next
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.200]   to these new phones.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:14.880]   So Google's probably smart to say how we get rid of this frame around the screen.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:20.000]   The deal is not done though, but this is something you might expect in a next generation
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.800]   Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.600]   Oh, see, I'm glad I waited to update.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.360]   I'll wait for the fancy non-integrated phone look.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.360]   Yes.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.560]   Actually, I really prefer it.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   Not having a bezel is great.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.520]   LG G6 is like this too.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.000]   It really is great.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.080]   I'm just not sure about the rounded edge and how to hold it.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.800]   Well, when the S8--
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   I'm going to think about it.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:47.080]   I'll have the S8 next week, but they aren't as aggressive, I think, as the S7 was, which
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.400]   really did go all the way around.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.480]   The S8 does give you more of an edge because they realize you need to hold it, right?
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.480]   People need to hold it.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.480]   Quite.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.920]   But it's nice because getting rid of the bezel means you can have a phone doesn't get out
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.320]   of control, but a bigger screen.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.040]   That's, I think, to be desired, right?
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.800]   What are the cases just then cover the bezel, right, or cover the little bit of the edge?
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.960]   Well, this is the S8.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:19.280]   So if you look at the S8, yeah, the edge, they call it the infinity display.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.760]   It practically goes off the edge.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.000]   You can hardly see a frame on the left and right.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.080]   And then they were able to-- Samsung finally got rid of its physical home keys.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.360]   So now they have just very small.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.560]   I mean, they have to have some bezel, but they're very small, you know, for cameras
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.560]   and speakers and microphones.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.160]   But a camera is something of that, yeah.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.360]   But they've gotten pretty darn small.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.360]   I can't wait to get mine.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.360]   And by doing that, they are able to get a 5-point-- what is it?
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.360]   5.7-inch?
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:47.680]   No, I'm sorry, 6.2-inch screen in a phone the size of Apple's iPhone 7 Plus, which is
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.880]   a 5 and 1/2-inch screen.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:55.720]   So a lot more screen without increasing the phone size.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.080]   Well, have you guys seen-- have we talked about the Centio?
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.080]   No, what's that?
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.080]   Superbook.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.080]   Superbook.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.520]   Go to centio, S-E-N-T-I-O.com.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.320]   Transform your smartphone into a laptop.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:15.480]   Oh, well, this-- yeah, so this is very similar to what-- this is what Samsung's doing with
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.480]   what they call DEX for the S-E.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.480]   Right.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.480]   I've ordered one of those.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.480]   I'll get that as well.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.480]   I can show you that in a couple of weeks.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.880]   And then, of course, Microsoft does it with something they call Continuum.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.440]   But remember, it was done first on Android with the Atrix.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.800]   Remember the Motorola Atrix?
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.360]   It was a phone that turned into a laptop.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.080]   So the idea-- this is a shell.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.080]   I don't think this is going to do as well as-- so the DEX and the Continuum are just
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.080]   docks.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.400]   The DEX is funny because you put your phone in it, it charges it, it has a fan in it,
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.960]   because your S-E is going to get really hot when you use it on the desktop.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.480]   And then, I think, what I'm really intrigued in-- Samsung has modified Android so that
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:57.480]   once it says, "Oh, you're on a 27-inch screen," it looks like a desktop operating system
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.480]   with a menu bar and--
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.720]   That's more for a laptop.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.200]   This is a laptop to travel with and get a larger screen.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.040]   The reason I brought this up now is because the effort to get ever more pixels and more
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.480]   space on your screen, but don't make it too big to hold, at some point, the phone is
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.280]   just that device you use here and there, and then you carry something else.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.240]   Why not carry a laptop?
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.240]   That's what I'm wondering.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.240]   I guess-- and by the way, this is a Kickstarter, so don't get--
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.800]   Well, that was my thing.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:32.880]   When I-- I've read all my gigs before I moved here, so I got the 15-inch Mac book.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.040]   I got last year's 15-inch Mac book because I actually like having ports and a pallet
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   one goes with to--
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   Me too.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   --and one to destroy the device with.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.400]   But, you know, that means I do have lots of pixels, and it is usable in that way, whereas
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.840]   everything-- all the other ones that are that bit smaller didn't quite cut it.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.120]   I guess the idea is, if you're carrying around a modern smartphone, you're carrying around
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.840]   desktop quality processors--
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.840]   --and all your data's on here, all your connectivity's on here.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.840]   Right.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.840]   So why bother carrying a second device?
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   Right.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.400]   But that's why I like the dock, because you can bring the dock with you and you get to somewhere
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.280]   else and you-- all you need is a keyboard mouse and a monitor.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.760]   I don't know if hotels are going to start.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.760]   You're sitting on a plane, though.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.760]   Right.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.760]   But this--
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760]   Right.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   --you can store the movie on your phone.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.760]   That's interesting.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.760]   How much is it?
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.760]   A hundred and eighteen bucks.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.440]   Well, that's not bad.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.840]   And it looks actually kind of like a Chromebook, or--
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   And it doesn't tether--
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.840]   --smartphone.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.400]   --because your connectivity is your phone.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.400]   Right.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.680]   That's the beauty of it.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:41.640]   Three million dollars they raised for the Superbook to turn your smartphone into a laptop.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.640]   Huh.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.120]   Well, it does kind of make sense.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.400]   So now they've got backlit keys, extra USB port.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.400]   Oh, this is funny.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.000]   They've got a lot of stretch goals.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   1080p.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.880]   Yeah, for $55 more, you get the 1080p in the backlit keys.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.080]   I would get that, for sure.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.080]   Right.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.880]   Are you getting-- I don't know.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.440]   Something I'll end up complaining about.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.440]   Right.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.720]   One thing that-- besides modifying Android, so it fits better on a screen, it looks better
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   on a desktop.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.440]   They also got Microsoft to provide applications, and Samsung's going to do some applications
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.240]   that do windowing, that do overlapping, that do tiling, to make it--
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   Because that's one.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   You know.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   Anyway.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   Anyway.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.680]   Anyway, let's take a break.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.640]   Come back with more.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.840]   Google Home app is hitting in multi-user support, finally.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.720]   Something that the Alexa's had for a while.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.920]   The Echo's had for a while.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.880]   The Google Book Search.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.480]   Burger King Ads.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.880]   Burger King Ads.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.000]   Facebook F8's coming up, what we might be seeing.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.400]   Oh, and Jeff, we've got to talk about your initiative.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.400]   Well, that's right.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.400]   Yeah, we'll talk about that.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.280]   Craig Newmark has been so long since we talked to you.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.640]   Craig Newmark, Facebook, and Mozilla to bring integrity back to the news biz.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   And Jeff's involved.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.640]   Which we wrote here every week.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.640]   Jeff, you're involved.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.440]   Yeah, well, we do that.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.440]   I did that.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.440]   I didn't want to make $1,000,000 either.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.320]   I'm just kidding.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.840]   Our show today brought to you by Segment.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.760]   Now, this is a little bit data geeky.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.200]   So bear with me if you're not one of those people who's responsible for a website or
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:30.800]   an app or an engineer responsible for collecting analytics segments at data hub.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.520]   A platform really that makes it easy to collect and unify and act on customer data no matter
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:40.120]   where it comes from, your website, your mobile app, your cloud platforms, and then process
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.120]   it.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.720]   It's kind of like plumbing.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:48.280]   So the way we do it, or we did it, and I think a lot of people are you got a website
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:55.680]   you start putting stuff little JavaScript stubs in there for Google Analytics and heat mapping
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.880]   and chart beat and use pretty soon.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.600]   You got 50 different little little stubs in there because you want to know what's going
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.600]   on with your website.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.640]   Well, imagine if instead of that you put one line of code, your segment code, and then
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:15.600]   everything is piped into your segment dashboard where you can graphically say where things
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.880]   go.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.280]   This is the easiest way to do it.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   And man, you're going to save a lot of engineering time.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.960]   Plus, your website will be more reliable.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.680]   It'll be easier to use.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.240]   It's a single API.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.560]   You write code integration just once and it unifies all your data and performing analytics
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.320]   on a platform from market out at MailChimp.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   Atlassian uses it and Tuuit uses it.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.360]   New Relic and Reuters, some of the world's best companies.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:45.080]   You could choose from hundreds of partner integrations, including the most popular apps
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.240]   for advertising, analytics, A/B testing, attribution.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.160]   That's just the A's.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.200]   With segment, one engineer, one guy or gal could quickly integrate a new analytics tool
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.000]   for the data-driven account manager, another for the app happy marketer, another for the
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.400]   data scientist who needs a unified data warehouse.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.880]   And what's nice is if any of the services you're using is offline for a little bit,
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.880]   don't worry.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.000]   Segment will continue to gather the data and then upload it to the service when it
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.680]   comes back online.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.320]   You can bring in your data from any source, import-horse historical data, customize what
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.920]   ends up in your data warehouse of choice.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.360]   It's the customer data platform, both developers and analysts' love.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:29.280]   It's got a great API and extensive partner ecosystem and it's going to save you a lot
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.480]   of time and a lot of money integrating these tools.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.720]   And by the way, your CEO will quickly, will love the quickly deployed integrations with
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.160]   Zendesk and Intercom and Nexus and on and on and on.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.880]   Over 8,000 of the world's best companies use segment.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.560]   I bet you never even heard of it.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.760]   I hadn't to drive growth and revenue.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.560]   That's exactly what you're looking for.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:28:05.920]   Try it free, the team plan for three months when you sign up at segment.com/twitsegment.com/twit.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.760]   So let's talk about this new venture, Jeff.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.720]   The TOW folks are among the contributors.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:19.920]   There's quite a few Craig Newmark, Ford Foundation, Democracy Fund, the Knight Foundation, the TOW
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:25.280]   Foundation, App, Nexus and Baderworks, a total $14 million fund.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.520]   And what are you going to do with it?
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.040]   And our CUNY School of Journalism, Graduate School of Journalism is going to minister
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   it.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   That's you.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.040]   That's us.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   That's us.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.040]   That's me.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.040]   So what are you going to do with this money?
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.560]   So this all started with Craig Newmark, who gave us a challenge and said do something
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.320]   about misinformation and disinformation.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.280]   And Craig, as you know, has been quite generous lately in the support of journalism.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.840]   He's always been generous, but he's really decided to step up and give a lot of money
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.520]   to a lot of players like Greg.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.520]   That's great.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.440]   Mozilla and Pointer and I think First Draft and other places.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.440]   So Craig's been doing great.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.240]   So he put the challenge out to us.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.720]   He came up with something that I'll describe in a second.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.880]   And then out of nowhere, I got a call from Facebook who said, what's up to?
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.520]   We're thinking about looking for kind of a clearing house for doing more things about
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.520]   journals.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.760]   I explained what Craig had started and they said, oh, sounds good.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:20.600]   And then along came Ford and then we ended up with nine funders and $14 million.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.200]   We'll work on trusted news.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.000]   I think that the opportunities we saw were number one.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.160]   I think there's been too much discussion about just the platform as the publishers.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.880]   And we need to really talk about the public conversation that the journalism is about
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.880]   reforming the public conversation.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   We've got to figure that out.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.720]   Number two, I think we need to bring more parties into the discussion, other responsible
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.720]   and affected parties like ad agencies and brands and ad networks and ad tech and P&P
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.480]   and PR and politics and so on.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:52.680]   Number three, we saw the opportunity to convene people and bringing people together so they
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.680]   could collaborate.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.600]   Number four, I see an opportunity for a flight to quality.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:02.560]   I think if you add up the fact that we talked about this two weeks ago, Havas and Guardian
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:08.960]   and BBC and Verizon all dumped out of YouTube advertising, telling Google to get their act
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.960]   together.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:17.120]   And Sleeping Giants has gotten 1,000 some advertisers to drop Breitbart and Bill O'Reilly's advertisers
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.120]   are disappearing like horses over the horizon.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.200]   So is Bill apparently.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.000]   And so is Bill too.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.560]   So you start to add it all together and I think that finally advertisers are saying, well,
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.800]   it does matter where my ad appears.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.840]   It does matter where my money goes.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.920]   And I think there's an opportunity there.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.040]   So we're going to fund much of this, most of this money will leave CUNY and go out and
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.040]   we're going to fund research projects and convenience in New York and around the world.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.720]   There's one project that's already underway that I've written about a little bit, which
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:54.560]   is about trying to gather signals about sites of quality and disrepute to help platforms,
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.600]   advertisers, ad networks and ad agencies decide where to put their money and maybe cut off
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.360]   some of the air supply to the bad guys.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.000]   I want to get some research going on how the conversation operates.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.240]   So it's really quite an opportunity, quite an obligation.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.640]   And let me be clear here that none of the Facebook money goes into my pocket.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:20.920]   And I emailed Leo as soon as this happened and made sure that there wasn't a worry about
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.120]   conflict of interest with the show.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.960]   I'll have to be clear about this as it goes.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.640]   Final thing to say is that I negotiated, we negotiated, my dean Sarah Bartland, I said
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   it was on the show, we negotiated independence.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.440]   Without independence, I wouldn't have done this for a second.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.640]   So there's a governance structure that guarantees us independence and guarantees me independence.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.360]   Otherwise, I wouldn't have done this.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.000]   But nonetheless, I debated about this.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.680]   But when Facebook, when you yell at Facebook for two years and Google it two years, you
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.960]   just say, do something to help journalism and then they come knocking at your door and
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   say, will you help us help journalism?
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.320]   To my mind, how could I say no?
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.760]   So I'm grateful we got these resources.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.120]   I hope I don't squander them.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.040]   I hope we use them really well and focused in targeted ways.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.680]   And what's the example of some of the things you're looking at?
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.120]   I mean, is it?
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.240]   So I think I want to understand better how the conversation occurs.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.320]   I think we've got to do a better job of being transparent about the manipulation that occurs
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.920]   of the platforms than of us.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.000]   There's also talking about news literacy.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.240]   News literacy can be a condescending term.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.880]   Like if you read our news, you're literate if you don't, you're not.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.920]   But news literacy more broadly defined about recognizing that the public is part of the
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.200]   creation, dissemination of information in news matters.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.280]   I also care about making media more public literate about getting journalists to listen
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.360]   better and understand the public better.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.200]   And I've talked about that in the show.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.760]   I really care about new forms of news, bringing journalism to the public conversation where
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:52.280]   it occurs, bringing news to Twitter and the Facebook in the forms that are appropriate
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.280]   for there.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.200]   You know, like a Snapchat forces us to remake our news for Snapchat.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.840]   But otherwise Facebook says, okay, here's a spot for your articles.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.840]   Put your articles in there.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.560]   I don't think that's sufficient.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.120]   So those are the kinds of things that will get going on.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.120]   Sounds very cool.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:12.880]   I hope you'll keep us up to date as you start new initiatives and so forth.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.800]   It's a challenge for the social media.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   It's a big challenge.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   It's a huge challenge.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.600]   And there's a lot of other great organizations that my favorite is an organization called
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.920]   First Draft Coalition, which was funded at the beginning by Google.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.840]   Claire Wardle and her sister Jenny Sargent are brilliant at this.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:35.000]   They did a huge fact checking effort in the French election with newsrooms there.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.440]   They're just amazing.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.360]   The TRUSH Project, which Richard Jinger says help back is about trying to get metadata
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.560]   around sites.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.440]   Dan Gilmore at Arizona State does a lot of work in news literacy.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.800]   So we come to this not competing trying to help, but there's I now have some money and
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.880]   resources to try to help.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:58.200]   So you know, it reminds me that the pollsters came out last week.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.200]   And you've got to be somewhat encouraged by the people who won pollsters.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:10.440]   I mean, pro publica, you know, is it invest is international consortium, investigative
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.920]   journalists from the classic.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.240]   Two of our former students are part of the Bayley News ProPublica Project.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.280]   But the best of all is David Ferrantel.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   Love.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.440]   If he had not won a Pulitzer, there would have been riots in conservatives.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:29.200]   He won for his coverage of Donald Trump's charitable donations.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.440]   New York Times staff.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.080]   I mean, maybe I guess some could say, oh, it's the usual suspects, you know, Peggy Noonan
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.840]   at the journal.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.720]   But I think it's really encouraging when you read this, it's clear a lot of good journalism
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   is being done.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.680]   And I don't mean left wing journalism, but I mean just good investigative journalism.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.960]   And let's be honest, a lot of it is liberal journalism.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:55.160]   I've argued the past on the show that we need more conservative journalism.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:00.640]   We need more journalism from the conservative worldview so that it can gain the trust of
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.320]   that part of America being clear.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.560]   There's plenty of other communities that also are under represented.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:11.840]   African Americans, Latino Americans, LGBT immigrants, women, lots of categories of America
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.640]   are underrepresented.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.000]   And and thus aren't trusted.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   They don't trust the media.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Right.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.320]   Um, Google, remember Google?
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.760]   Remember Google book search?
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.520]   In fact, I think when we started this show, that was kind of a hot topic some years ago.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.240]   Actually, the project started.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.240]   I didn't realize this.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.520]   I'm reading Scott Rosenberg's great article on back channel about this.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.880]   I didn't realize it started 15 years ago.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:40.880]   That's amazing.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.200]   And this was Google saying screw it.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.760]   We're not going to worry about copyright.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.920]   We're not going to worry about what publishers say.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:53.120]   We're just going to stop, start scanning the world's libraries, all the books, because
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.720]   we think that's going to add real value.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.120]   And then of course, publishers sued.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.800]   A lot of famous authors said this is horrible.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.600]   We talked about, I know Jeff, you were on in a lot of these conversations about the
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.600]   authors.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:12.080]   Siva Varynathan was also on the show talking about it at the time.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.680]   Google won its court cases.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.320]   Took them a long time.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.440]   They only won a few years ago.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:23.600]   But the judge in the case ultimately, it was a decade long legal battle that ended last
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   year.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.920]   The Supreme Court turned down an appeal by the authors' guilt.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.480]   And the judge whose opinion it was, not the Supreme Court, but the lower court judge's
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.480]   opinion.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.680]   It was said the public good is served.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.840]   There's more benefit to society than there's a downside for authors.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.600]   And that's clearly the case.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.320]   But it seems like maybe this 10-year battle sapped Google of its initiative on this.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:51.000]   It feels like, well, here's what Rosenberg writes.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.800]   When I started working on this story, I feared at first the books no longer existed as a
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.520]   discreet part of the Google organization.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:02.560]   The Google had actually shut the project down.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.480]   When I started asking questions, it closed up like a startled turtle.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.400]   For weeks, there didn't seem to be anybody around or available who could or would speak
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.360]   to the current state of the book's effort.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.720]   And then he's saying he looks at the Google Books history page.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.800]   That trails off in 2007.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.960]   Blogs stopped updating in 2012.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.960]   So he said, what's going on?
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.600]   There are still, apparently, some Googlers working on book search.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.040]   They're still adding new books, although at a much slower pace, he says, than the peak
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.040]   2010-2011.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.840]   He interviewed a Google engineer who had worked on books for a decade and now leads
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.960]   the team, Stefan Jaskovich.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.400]   They're not focused on shiny features and things that are very visible to users, said
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   Jaskovich.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.720]   It's more like behind the scenes work in perfecting the technology, acquiring content, processing
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:56.400]   it properly so we can view the entire book online and adjusting the search algorithm.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.960]   It seems like it's back-burned a little bit, which is too bad because I think this is amazing.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.960]   Yeah, it is.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.960]   Jaskovich.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:10.920]   It could be a super powerful source of training type data for teaching computers how to interpret
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.920]   all kinds of things.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.760]   I bet you that was one of the goals.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.760]   That's interesting.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.320]   I hadn't thought about that.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.160]   It's like just entering the world's knowledge into a computer and hoping it gets smart.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.640]   Yeah, well, that's how IBM trained Watson.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:28.920]   They send it medical-specific data or lawyer-specific data.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   So imagine literature data and what a computer could tell us based on that.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.720]   It's kind of fun or scary.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.720]   I don't know.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.720]   Depends on the literature.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.880]   Scott Rosenberg quotes Stefan Jaskovich saying, "The scanning stations could take
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.400]   a minute to continue to involve new...these are the book scanning stations.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.960]   New revisions roll on every six months.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.280]   LED lighting not available at the project start his help so as studying more efficient
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.600]   techniques for human operators to flip pages.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.000]   It's almost like finger-picking on a guitar," he says.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.800]   So we find people have great ways of turning pages.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.600]   Where's the thumb and that kind of stuff?
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.240]   What a horrible job.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.440]   Feeding the books into the machine.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.840]   Well, initially they cut the spines off and fed them through them.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.840]   That way.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.840]   Yikes.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:17.160]   It would be worth you just buying a perfect bound thing that works.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.560]   So one of the Google booth is 45, I think, has all the spines stuck on the wall.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.800]   There's a lot of fake bookshelf.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   Oh, funny.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   From when they were doing it that way.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   And they were cutting them up.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   Wow.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   But it depends on the books.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.200]   Obviously, if it's an old book from a classic collection, you have to turn the pages.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.200]   Right.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.960]   But that was a way of taking a lot of stuff and feeding it through quickly.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.400]   But there's two other groups that do this as well.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.480]   Obviously, there's Amazon who have book search and there's the Internet Archive who have
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.280]   been scanning books for a long time and continue to do it and have improving their search of
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.840]   scam material quite a lot recently as well.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:56.000]   I wonder how much of the energy of this was just sapped by the court fight.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.840]   I sense that this happened in the early days of Google's relationship with journalism
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:06.560]   too, where I think that Larry and Sergey and Karat and then everybody started smashing
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.640]   them when they kind of said, "Okay."
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.640]   Enough.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.480]   We got other work to do.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.160]   Rosenberg writes, "You'd think a Supreme Court victory would have meant a renewal of energy
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.480]   for Google Books, rev up the scanners, full speed ahead, but by all evidence, this is
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.480]   not in the case.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.640]   Partly, that's because the database is already so huge."
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.000]   Jessica, which says, "We have a fixed budget that we're spending.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.640]   At the beginning, we were scanning everything on every shelf.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.400]   At some point, we started getting a lot of duplicates.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.080]   Today, Google gives its partner libraries, pick lists, and says, "Well, maybe they got
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.080]   everything."
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.280]   But there are plenty of other explanations for the dampening of Google's ardor, the
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:45.880]   bad taste left from the lawsuits, the rise of shiny and exciting new ventures with more
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.880]   immediate payoffs.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.360]   Ruth, is Ruth Porat one?
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.000]   I think Porat must be one, right?
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.840]   What is this line item?
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.840]   I don't know.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.280]   I always thought this was great.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:02.440]   It was obvious it would not impinge on book sales, but it would make it a contract.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.440]   But the contract would help.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.440]   I find them.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.440]   I've done all the time.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.880]   I have done so many books because they found it on search.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.800]   Then you buy it.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:19.640]   Although I will confess, when I was in maybe high school, and so this was like in 1990—oh,
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:26.720]   hold on, 1995, I remember downloading some book program and getting access to all of
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.160]   these—they were public works.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.160]   So I think I—
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.160]   Well, that's appropriate.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:39.160]   Well, yes, but I spent hours as a kid, basically, or as a cheap student reading all of these
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.160]   books on my desktop.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.040]   That's awesome, right?
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.040]   That's fantastic.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.200]   But if Google Books had been around, I probably would have just gone that way.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.200]   So I can't—
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.200]   Well, you can't—
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.920]   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think in the Google Book Search you can read the
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.720]   entire text of any book.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   I don't think you could either.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.720]   You can read pages.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.520]   You can for the pre-1921s, I think.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.520]   Okay.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.120]   If you search for the orphan works or the non-copyright works.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.120]   But no, the adicopyright ones.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   Adicopyright works.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.320]   Adicopyright, but not—
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.600]   Nobody claims them.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.360]   And that was the author guild's issue was the orphan works.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.240]   Yeah, which is stupid because, you know, you want those back in publication.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.240]   Right.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.240]   One of those.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:21.040]   And yes, the point is the cost of making digital edition should not be high, especially
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.960]   if Google's already scanned the damn thing.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.400]   If they're going to scan OCR for you, then you could make a digital edition from that.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.400]   Put it on Amazon.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.400]   Longtail, remember?
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:35.040]   It's incremental income.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:40.120]   Facebook is facing increased publisher resistance to instant articles.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.000]   I did not know this, Jeff, but—
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.440]   There's been some ardor.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.480]   It's where it went off.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.960]   New York Times has quit.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.280]   Aren't you got the negotiation employees, much as anything?
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   Okay.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.080]   How is AMP doing?
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:01.640]   I mean, AMP is the kind of the open version of instant articles, right?
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.640]   It's funny.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.400]   Each has its adherence.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:10.880]   I think instant articles is trying to increase—because Facebook can control monetization there.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.360]   You can sell your—the publisher can sell their own ads, but Facebook controls the
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.360]   opportunity.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.640]   So they're adding a lot of ad opportunities.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.200]   They're trying to pump up the monetization.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.200]   AMP is a page that's out there.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.160]   The problem with AMP that I still see is the URL.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:30.880]   This was—and I've been told this is a problem of web standards—that to make AMP serve
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.200]   as fast as it does—this is part of your problem, or originally—it does serve from
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.200]   Google CDN.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.840]   It's a content delivery network, but it serves under a Google URL.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:46.800]   Because otherwise, if it tried to mimic the creator's URL, then security would say,
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.160]   "Oh, that looks funny to us."
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.800]   And so there isn't a good way, yep, to fix that.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.120]   So AMP does look like it all comes through Google, even though it's still the publisher's
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.360]   ads and AMP has nothing around that.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.880]   They're both a little creaky.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:05.000]   I think they're both trying to solve problems that should be solved otherwise.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.760]   I mean, just with better websites?
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.360]   Yeah, we just screwed up the web.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.080]   And then in terms of instant articles, I do like it, but I've said to folks at Facebook
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.800]   over the last year or so, don't play to our worst egotistical instincts, which is that
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.480]   everything is an article.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:29.920]   Make us force us like Snapchat to rethink the form of news that's appropriate to the platform.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.560]   I did see, however, I don't know if you saw it today, that there's a—I guess I can
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.560]   saw the rundown.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.120]   There's a new late version of Twitter.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:41.240]   I couldn't get it to work based on progressive web apps, which is AMP plus more functionality,
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.240]   which is really interesting to see.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.440]   That's the first effort I've really seen break out of the Google world.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.440]   I think that's cool.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:55.680]   The light Twitter is just mobile Twitter optimised a bit.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.760]   It was intended for low bandwidth phones.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.400]   Low bandwidth, but it's PWA.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.400]   It's still progressive web apps, which is an ad-all.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.200]   Progressive web app, but it's not AMP.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.800]   But well-known, that's an ad-all, that's an PWA is an ad-all, to AMP.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   PWA is what?
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.800]   No, no, no, no, it isn't.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   Okay.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:20.120]   So, PWA is an initiative to have web apps that behave like mobile apps.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.160]   And it's led by the Chrome team at Google.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.800]   They've pushed it very strongly.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.400]   AMP is a parallel thing, led by a different group of Google.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.800]   And they do interoperate well because they already work.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   But PWA doesn't have anything to do with AMP directly.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.760]   Well, the Washington Post demonstrated PWA.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.920]   It was heavily using AMP.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.560]   Yes, yeah.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.160]   And they've abandoned that one, which is kind of annoying.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.160]   It is annoying because it was a great app.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.160]   So, yeah, I don't know where it goes there.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.160]   I'm not sure.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:54.480]   I think what's happening with the New York Times leaving Instant Articles is they're trying
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.120]   to negotiate for more revenue on the pages.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.760]   The thing I've heard from publishers is some publishers say, this should equal what the
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.840]   web does, my own site does.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:08.960]   And other publishers, smart publishers say, no, it's new traffic and new revenue and it
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:09.960]   beats my programmatic ads.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.960]   And I like that.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.560]   So it depends on your expectations to really study.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:19.160]   I mean, the interesting thing for me has been seeing what AMP has done to encourage newspapers
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.680]   to not be bloated in the first place.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.240]   So they've basically taken, they've built the AMP version and then they go, wait, why
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.880]   is that all made site so bad compared to this?
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:33.640]   And then they're actually able to get executives to listen to, you need to stop injecting,
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:37.080]   you know, gigabytes of junk into the page for advertising.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:41.520]   So the other problem is trying to get the advertisers to clean up their act.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.520]   Yes.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.040]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:51.360]   Okay, I was a fascinating topic.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.360]   Next, Leo.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.440]   No, but the birthday girls board, we got to move on.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.440]   We got to move on.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   Come on.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.920]   No, I just fit a minute on Twitter light.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.480]   So Twitter light is interesting.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.280]   So one of the things when I moved here initially, I didn't have a local SIM.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:13.840]   So I was using the T-Mobile, you know, throttle down to 2G bandwidth and did the thing.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:19.200]   And when I was doing that, I noticed how much better that all these progressive web app
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:23.680]   and AMP related things were than either local apps or the websites.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.640]   They didn't lock the phone up and do a nearest much.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.640]   Really?
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.560]   So even the local apps were slower than the progressive apps.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.520]   Progressive apps are at labs that load in bit by bit from the net.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.520]   Yes.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:39.320]   Because this was true of web apps a lot anyway, because the web is designed to load asynchronously.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:46.600]   Whereas a lot of mobile apps are effectively a browse that only works on one domain.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.320]   But they don't have this sort of subtle asynchrony that web apps do.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.360]   So they assume there's a lot of bandwidth there and they just sit there and lock up and take
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.680]   a long time to load.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.640]   And it's noticeable if I'm on that connection that the mobile Twitter site is way better
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.200]   than the mobile Twitter app.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:06.880]   Like significantly faster and more responsive.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:12.920]   For the first time ever, an advertisement has intentionally triggered a voice assistant.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.280]   Intentionally.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.680]   We do it by accident all the time.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.440]   Now, if you've got a Google Home, go ahead, Jeff.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.640]   Put your Google Home up next to the speaker.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:25.200]   What's funny is this Burger King ad doesn't do what it was trying to do.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.640]   So maybe they didn't expect it to work.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.640]   They just thought it would make everybody laugh.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.440]   You're watching a 15 second Burger King ad, which is unfortunately not enough time to
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.440]   explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.040]   But I got an idea.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.280]   Oh, what is the Whopper Burger?
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.280]   Wow.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.520]   I'm going to look at Pedia.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.840]   The Whopper is a hamburger consisting of a flame grilled porter pound beef patty, sesame
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:56.320]   seed bun, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup and sliced onions.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.120]   Oh, it did work.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.440]   It did work.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:05.200]   Now, I've had Google had, okay, so here's what I hear this story like evolving and I feel
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.240]   like so played by conglomerates here.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:16.080]   They said Wikipedia was edited to change the top section of it, instead of it for a while.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.440]   And they were like, did Burger King do it?
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.440]   Did someone else do it?
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.440]   Okay.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.880]   So was that Prankster or Burger King?
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.600]   The other thing then was that I had seen that Google had stopped that from working, but clearly,
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.600]   Jeff, yours didn't.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   It just weren't.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:36.360]   So it looks like Burger King is behind the Wikipedia edit because the line was added
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:41.520]   by somebody with a username, Fairmachado123.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:48.280]   Burger King's marketing chief is Fernando Machado and he uses Fairmachado123 on Instagram
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.680]   and a very similar name on Twitter.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.600]   So still feel like I'm being played.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:50:01.280]   You are being played, but not by Google, by Burger King.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:06.520]   This is like, okay, so this is why voice authentication needs to come sooner rather
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.520]   than later.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.520]   But also just have it.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   But also just have it.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:15.400]   But by the way, the Verge modified the Wikipedia entry and the Google Home said the new entry.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:20.200]   So, you know, if I were Burger King, I'd be very nervous at this point.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   We should check.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   We should read the other story.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   Yeah, read the other story.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.800]   Oh, yeah, I don't get far worse.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.800]   One right there on the rundown.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:26.800]   Oh, okay.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.800]   So, so this is the.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   So nail flippings.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.160]   The Whopper is made of toenail flippings.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.160]   Oh my God.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:39.680]   Because the Wikipedia was adapted and voice comes from Wikipedia.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.240]   Now they fixed it and I would guess Wikipedia is locked it down.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.520]   Although oddly, they've locked it with the promotional copy.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:49.120]   Well, of course they did.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.600]   Well, but Wikipedia doesn't take ads.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.000]   That's very interesting.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   It's not inaccurate.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.880]   I mean, the Whopper and I mean, I don't know.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.920]   It's not made of nail clippings.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:58.920]   That's inaccurate.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:05.000]   And so I know I yes, like if it's a delicious burger with lightly toasted sesame.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   That's true.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   It is just mere facts.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.200]   But by the way, Burger King got what it really wanted, which is all this social media play.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.200]   You're welcome Burger King.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.200]   Here we are.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.400]   I'm going to be better than Chipotle Burger King.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.240]   You can buy an ad on this very show.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.240]   We'll play your ad.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.840]   Oh, I'll eat burgers if you want during the show.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.040]   Not if it's the wrong of my fast days.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.040]   No, right.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.280]   But isn't that interesting?
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.840]   And I wonder if we'll see more of that.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.600]   That'd be a better commercial Leo.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.400]   You're on your fast day and we start.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.400]   They start.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.920]   Carson runs the Whopper under your nose to torture.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:42.920]   Shaking.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.920]   Isn't that funny?
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.920]   Isn't that funny?
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.320]   It's like it feels like.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:57.060]   But it feels like we're going to be like people were saying apparently when I did my little
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:00.000]   birthday thing, they were like, oh, you triggered my echo.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.640]   You know, and I'm like, oops.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:05.760]   It's a dick move to trigger someone's voice activated speaker.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   Intentionally it is.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.800]   It's easy enough to do accidentally.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.800]   Yes.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.960]   In fact, it goes back to Aaron Paul, what there was an Xbox ad where the actor from
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:21.840]   making bad issued some Xbox commands and quite famously, because many people, not many,
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:28.280]   but probably many relatively, I did had their Xbox hooked up to their television set.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:35.200]   And so when he issued the command in the Xbox ad, it took over the TV and you no longer
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.200]   were watching the ad.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.120]   That was an unintended consequence.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.880]   Like ad advertising.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.200]   I think this is quite clever.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.280]   You know, I wonder what Google will do to keep it from happening again.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.760]   I guess there's nothing they can do.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.760]   You're right.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:52.000]   The one solution Stacey is voice authentication training.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.640]   Or you could do like, didn't we have a whole, I feel it in my hallucinating this conversation,
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.720]   but we had a whole thing about frequencies that you could play underneath.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.880]   Yeah, no, we talked about it.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.480]   And I know everybody by playing a five kilohertz tone.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   Oh, right.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:06.480]   Show and everybody was getting.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.920]   You really pissed off everybody below a certain age.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.920]   I pissed off.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:11.920]   It seems like this is my new thing.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:17.000]   I just thought everybody last week because I was so clueless about the Pepsi commercial.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.320]   Stacey had explained it all to me.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:24.040]   And I was, I was not the best, the best user or best person to explain it.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:28.160]   So I think you did a fine job.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.840]   And I kind of stand by my, well, no, let's not bring it up again.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:39.400]   I was going to say, Hey, Leo just loves to shoot himself in the foot.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:44.120]   So do you see the data also right underneath that as the data on the Pepsi ad turns out
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.120]   it was a pretty effective.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.120]   See, that's the thing.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.920]   I mean, there's no such thing as bad publicity.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.480]   No.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.920]   So where's, where's that?
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.840]   If you go down to the charts, you go down to the charts.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.480]   A lot of people kind of like the Pepsi ad.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:02.400]   So look at this Hispanic Americans, 75% left more favorable than not.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:06.760]   Black Americans, 51% white Americans, 41%.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.960]   Well, more favorable toward Pepsi after watching the video than before.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.960]   Hmm.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.840]   So all that, it's kind of underscores my point, which is all the outrage that you saw on Twitter
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.480]   wasn't universal outrage.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.240]   It was just a, well, nothing on Twitter is universal.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.240]   Well, that's my point.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.840]   And news organizations to stop treating it as anything but just this, you know, tiny
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.760]   little microcosm.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:31.760]   That's so tiny, 310.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.560]   Hey, I said it's pretty big.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:36.360]   310 million monthly active users is pretty big.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.240]   So many people are in the US.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.920]   Yeah, I know.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.920]   I know.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:41.920]   I know.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.600]   So why did, why did they have William sell 30% of his stock?
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.760]   I asked you that.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.760]   The crush.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.960]   But actually a bigger question is why.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:50.960]   Did you get recently?
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:51.960]   Yeah, last week.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.960]   Okay.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.680]   But he says, I just wanted to cash out, but here's the bigger question.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:05.880]   When Adam Bain and Adam Messenger left, they left 35 million in unexerciseed options behind.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:10.080]   Well, were the options above water?
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:14.240]   This, I was questioning the story because I was like, were they worth anything or would
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.600]   they just have to wait for them maybe to be worth something?
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:22.400]   I mean, I've got a bunch of exercise options in technoriety that I've got to.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.400]   That's what I think.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.400]   I'm tired of my package.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.400]   Technoriety is too alive.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.400]   Kind of.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:33.640]   It got sold to someone else this year and they based, hopefully, Meryl Streng said, hi,
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.640]   you get nothing.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:38.200]   It's still sort of a bit twisted.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:44.320]   It still vaguely exists and is still vaguely doing something, but I'm not quite sure what.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   Excellent description.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.520]   No, I mean, I don't know.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:55.280]   I think it's basically coasting on the Google juice it got from when it was actually useful.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:00.160]   But that's probably a little mean to say, but hey, you know, I don't know if anything
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.160]   anymore.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:06.160]   Well, the stock that they left behind obviously hadn't invested or they would have exercised
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.400]   it before they left.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.520]   So they would have had to stay there longer to exercise it.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.160]   I don't know what there's.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.160]   No, no, no.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.160]   If it's vested, you've still got to pay to exercise it.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.160]   So yes.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:23.280]   If they had options that the strike price was above the current price, then of course,
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.280]   the money to get the stock.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   Right.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.280]   I understand that.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.080]   But 75% of them had not vested.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.080]   Yes.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:37.400]   The thing is, if they have vested, you've still got to come up with a big chunk of cash.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.400]   Right.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.400]   The exact point.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.400]   You may have a tax hit that wipes out all your gains and ends up costing you money.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:49.880]   So this is why stock options, like they're not worth anything until they're actually worth
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:54.080]   something and then you better cash in as fast as possible and take your tax it.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.520]   I mean, but that is the right way to do it.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.560]   The stupid thing to do is where you exercise your stock options or the assumption of the
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:04.760]   stock is still going up and then get the tax, realize the liability and then sell them
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:05.760]   and then you're already screwed.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.520]   And a lot of people have thought about that.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:13.280]   Can't you, won't a brokerage loan you the money to exercise if you sell right away?
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.280]   No, if you, yes, you don't have that cash.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.480]   You're, let me write you a check so you can give me a bigger check.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:24.160]   If you exercise and sell right away, yes, then you can do that in one transaction and
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.280]   then sell it and you put some aside for the tax and it works.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.760]   So there's, there's a problem.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:32.240]   As long as you're not underwater, which is far, I mean, I don't know, doesn't say what
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:38.800]   the strike price was on these options, but my sense is it wasn't underwater because they
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.760]   were worth something, 35 million to be exact.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.720]   Well, just had invested.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.640]   Well, they invested, they don't, they don't exist.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.320]   They don't exist unless they stay there.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.000]   That's the point by leaving.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.960]   But that's, that's looking at a sunk.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.960]   That's a potential.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   Right.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   That's not even a sunk.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:00.240]   I mean, maybe, maybe Adam and Adam kind of had an idea that maybe that stock price wasn't
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.240]   going on.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.160]   It could have been, could have been.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:06.240]   The biggest indicator here is they're like, you know what?
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.240]   We don't believe in this company.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.280]   So we're leaving and we don't care that we're walking away from.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.280]   Right.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.920]   A potential, 35 million dollars.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.920]   A possible chunk of.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.280]   Now I should point out they made 14 million dollars between them.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.560]   So they're doing okay.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:27.560]   Your good news is they can have as many whoppers as they want.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:33.760]   U.S. government ceases fire and legal spat with Twitter.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:38.560]   That was a fun one.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:45.920]   So remember the rogue alt USCIS account?
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.080]   This is actually quite funny.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.920]   It was one of the many government alt accounts.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:57.560]   It was U.S. CIS as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:01.880]   And the White House did not like the things they were saying.
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:07.400]   Now I have to admit there's things said all the time on Twitter that I don't like.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:12.320]   But what I don't do is then issue with summons.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:16.840]   The U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a summons and the funniest part is it was
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.960]   such a poorly written summons.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.000]   First of all it was backdated a month.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.720]   Like had the wrong date on it and said they had to respond within a few days but it was
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.200]   last month.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:37.600]   And then apparently they cited U.S. Code Section 1509 which gives them the right to
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:42.720]   issue a subpoena to investigate the taxation of imported goods.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:47.960]   They don't in fact have subpoena power having to do with Twitter and free speech or anything
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.400]   like that.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:54.480]   So it was a completely bogus summons which Twitter quite rightly not only fought but
[00:59:54.480 --> 01:00:00.960]   went to court and sued countersued with the help of the ACLU.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:07.920]   And you know what when I ran local sites the summons as we got more than anything else
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:13.960]   were from police departments police chiefs trying to find out the IP addresses of the
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.000]   cops were complaining about them in our forums.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.960]   Sorry.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.960]   You can't say that about me.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:27.080]   So they were informed.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.840]   summons probably wasn't such a good summons and they probably didn't have the best you
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:38.560]   know optical you know it didn't look good for a federal government to try to get somebody
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.560]   for same bad things about them.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.520]   So they withdrew and Twitter voluntarily dismissed their suit.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.400]   Didn't we have an act on our books the was it treason and sedition act that in 17 something.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.640]   Yeah that's used often against hackers nowadays.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.040]   It's still there.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.080]   It's the reason Edward Snowden can't come home.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:05.800]   One of the one of the features of the sedition and treason act is that it was like you can't
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.160]   testify on your behalf.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.880]   You can't I can't remember the deal but we talked to Edward Snowden's lawyer by the way
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:15.360]   a fine episode of triangulation which is nominated for a webby award and I sure would appreciate
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.880]   if you voted for it.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.280]   So watch that episode but he talked.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.160]   I will now.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:28.800]   So yes Snowden said I can't come back because I wouldn't get a fair trial and the reason
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:37.680]   he wouldn't get a fair trial is because the rules of this act from the 19th century prevent
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.640]   him from mounting of you know a defense.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.000]   Actually I'm sorry it's not the sedition and treason.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.400]   It's the 1917 espionage act.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.680]   Yes sorry I got it wrong.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.680]   It's the same.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:54.440]   So it is but it's the tree I thought the trees should sedition and treason is that gone.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.440]   Thank you.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.240]   I thought that was a very famous act.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.240]   Yes.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:04.320]   In fact it's quoted in Howard Zinn's People's History of the United States as an example
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:09.840]   of how little the first amendment was respected by the founders because right after they created
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.440]   the Bill of Rights they also passed the Sedition and treason act.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.440]   Right okay.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.440]   Yes.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.240]   Boy your history is good Stacy.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.240]   Wow.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.240]   No.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.880]   So I'm just closer to my classes.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.680]   That's right.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.600]   So now you've back handedly said I'm old.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.600]   That's okay.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.600]   Oh.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.040]   But yeah the Sedition and treason act actually was prior restraint right.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.960]   They could throw them in jail if they were going to publish.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960]   Oh yes.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.120]   Yes it was really friendly.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.480]   It kind of I feel like we might be coming back to that given the relationship.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.480]   Oh good.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:51.240]   So the Espionage Act I'm just I'm looking at Glenn Greenwald's article.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:03:00.960]   I guess just it makes the essence of it is that anyway he can't have a fair trial he
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:06.160]   feels because of the rules of the way he'd be prosecuted.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:11.760]   I can't find it here but I will leave that as an exercise for the reader.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:17.440]   Do we want to talk about Amazon streaming 4K video from space because I'm really curious
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440]   about how that's happening.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.440]   Okay.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.440]   That'll be neat.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.320]   If you talk about Bezos and selling stock.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.800]   No let's do that and then we'll do and then do a basis.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.640]   He's selling a lot of stock a billion dollars a year.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.440]   Oh Bezos I just saw his annual letter is hilarious.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.160]   Where does he can afford by the way to sell there is a billion dollars a year of stock.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.760]   I'm not really put a dent in his fortune.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.760]   Yes.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:45.240]   He also told people that it's going to be so fast that there won't be a bathroom on the
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.240]   ship.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.240]   So.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.160]   Oh okay.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.920]   So that's the state cancer.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:56.640]   That's the blue blizzard the blue digital blue blue ocean blue origin.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.640]   Blue origin.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.160]   That's they're going to have in the long run they plan to be doing real space stuff but
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.760]   in the interim they're going to do space tourism where you'll go up and down.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.800]   I would I would totally I would pay a lot of money to go and see the earth from space.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.880]   How much is a lot of money.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.120]   Well I don't have that much money so.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.120]   That's the problem.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.120]   You can say that all you want.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.720]   Well because space X have got people going around the moon which is just as a specter
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.600]   sort of how we can do that you can't do.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:31.760]   Well it's two people and I think it's pretty clear one of them is going to be Elon.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.720]   He won't say it's fair.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.720]   It's fair.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.440]   I mean it can buy it.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.840]   Can you say the one's okay.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.560]   Yeah it's going to be somebody like that.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.880]   I can tell you see sir.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:47.720]   So Bezos was speaking at a conference he said the trip on his company's new shepherds tourist
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:54.280]   spacecraft will be so quick that you better go to the bathroom in advance.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.600]   The whole thing from boarding until you're back in the ground is probably 40 or 41 minutes.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:01.000]   We don't have to put a bathroom in in other words.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.080]   Wow so it's actually less time than you get on the vomit comment.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.240]   Really you get more than 40 minutes.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:18.600]   It takes about 90 minutes but you get a total of exactly how much fee for you get.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.600]   Right.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:25.240]   I wonder he hasn't said how much this will cost right.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.740]   No.
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.800]   It's really an amusement park ride.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.800]   Yeah exactly.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.400]   Here's the let me show you.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.480]   Just be gone mad.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.040]   This is the picture of what you'll be sitting in.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.040]   It's very well.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.040]   It's like a big echo.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.040]   Exactly.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.040]   It's a giant echo.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.400]   It'll take me to the moon.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.120]   Oh I'm sorry you guys.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.120]   That's okay.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.320]   I don't think anybody's going to the moon.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:56.040]   What we don't know he's going to he's taken out a billion dollars every year for the next
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:59.120]   few years to finances and selling his stock.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:06.600]   What we don't know is how much this trip will cost as he six tourists.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:11.640]   No bathroom as you can see Bezos is worth seventy five billion dollars.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.880]   So you know billion here billion there.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.200]   What's the big deal?
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:23.160]   Here he is in front of the vehicle.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:28.720]   They said the flight is so short no one will want to use their valuable time in the bathroom.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.160]   That's probably true.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.280]   But that wasn't the story.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.280]   That's a good story.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.720]   I'm wrong with that story but that's not the four K story.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:43.640]   The NASA and Amazon Web Services on April twenty six.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:47.200]   So Mark your calendar you're going to want to see this John come over to my house.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.720]   I have a four K TV.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.520]   We'll watch it together.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:51.520]   Are going to broadcast.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:57.120]   This is the first time a four K stream stream has been sent from space.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:00.680]   It'll be 10 30 am Pacific on the twenty sixth.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.840]   It's going to be for NAB.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.760]   They're going to show it at NAB.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.760]   Oh wow.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:09.400]   And then you'll be able to watch it as a four K recording after the fact on a NASA's website.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.400]   How are they doing?
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.360]   They're really streaming a four K because getting from I mean the internet in space
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.360]   is terrible.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.520]   It's a high latency low bandwidth.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.520]   It's not good.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:25.240]   Well wait a minute though remember it's a one way it's a one way stream.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.920]   It's not the latency doesn't matter you're sending it down.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920]   Okay.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.720]   And it's going to be a big this for a while.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:35.440]   Sending videos from GSA from orbit is kind of a thing.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:39.920]   You could send as you say microwave you've got good line of sight.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.280]   You send it down and microwave can carry a lot of bandwidth right?
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.280]   Tons of bands.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:47.720]   I mean because they're moving fast right.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:52.760]   Geostation is easy because the station is the aim the microwave being very careful.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:57.400]   Whereas this will involve like a bunch of ground stations handing over which is what
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.400]   makes it difficult.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.720]   Unless they are going to send out to GSA from back down again.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.760]   It's not clear.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.080]   See this was my question.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.280]   I was like this is awesome.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:09.960]   I'm sure it's going to be gorgeous but how the heck are they streaming four K from space?
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.920]   I can't even get four K and I'm on the ground.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.880]   It's a good bit it's a good publicity piece for Amazon Web Services right?
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.240]   So if you're going to NAB the National Association of Broadcast Convention in Las Vegas this
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:28.240]   year you're going to want to go to the reaching for the stars superstession connecting to the
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:34.400]   future with NASA and Hollywood and that's where they're going to show it.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.600]   That's worth going to NAB for actually.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.600]   Let's go.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.600]   NAB is not a bad show.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.600]   Yeah we used to cover it every year.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.600]   How do you cover it?
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.600]   You covered it?
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.040]   Oh yeah we covered it.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.360]   We have a booth there for many years.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:50.320]   Well because a lot of technologies announced there particularly the kinds of technology
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.440]   I'm interested in cameras and microphones.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.440]   Streamings.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.440]   Streamings.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.440]   Television.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.440]   That kind of stuff.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:01.440]   When I was at Apple on Quik Time we used to go every year and they used to send the engineers
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:06.160]   because it was the best opportunity for us to listen to the video professionals and what
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:08.840]   they actually wanted in Quik Time.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.320]   So the entire instrument would man the booth.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.560]   That was how we did it.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:18.800]   So Jeff gave me this link to Jeff Bezos.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.440]   Yearly led it to shareholders.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.360]   Should I read this Jeff?
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.240]   So Jeff what does day two look like?
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:29.120]   The office building he's in is called day one.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.160]   When he moved he moved the name.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.440]   So he's explained day two is stasis followed by irrelevance followed by a squishy, painful
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:42.160]   decline followed by death and that is why it is always day one.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.160]   Wow.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.960]   I love that.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.960]   Wow.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.680]   Ritter Fogle shared that.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.400]   It's a Bayzosian.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.720]   That's a very Bayzosian.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   That's pretty funny.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:06.040]   He's like, he's like he's like he's like he's like he is like he's like he's like he's like,
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.760]   he's like he's like he's like he's like he's like he's like he drags you to the edge of
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.760]   every capability you have.
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:15.520]   And then he comes out with an amazing hyena laugh.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.480]   And then Kevin sent me a YouTube video.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.480]   I really want to go to space.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.000]   So I made my own astronaut training program because nobody else would have me.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.680]   I'm like a pet up for adoption and I just decided to adopt myself.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.560]   I've already made sure that I won't throw up and I won't go crazy.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.040]   So this is the vomit comment she's doing to do.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.040]   He's weighing me down.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.040]   The biggest down here.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.040]   He does the name right?
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.040]   You've seen him before.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.040]   I don't know her.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.040]   Who is this?
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.040]   Oh my.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.040]   She's awesome.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.040]   It's Simone's Earths.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.040]   Yes.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.040]   Shall we rent it?
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.960]   She's the queen of shitty robots.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.520]   She basically made all those right.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.520]   Oh yeah, it's her.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.520]   Oh, we love her.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.520]   Yes.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.520]   She can float in it and experience what it's like to be weightless.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.520]   You ready for this?
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.520]   She's a YouTube star.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.840]   My jumper is like an onion.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.280]   This is like layers upon layers.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:05.240]   So now she's going to the spa for some reason.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.320]   So she ends up going to the, um, the, the right one.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.200]   Oh, oh, this is, oh, I know what this is.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:15.080]   This is, this is the, those, uh, suspension tanks.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.080]   Yeah, I did that.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:19.160]   I did a column in that in San Francisco years and years and years ago.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.480]   Yeah, this is, this is, this is to be all the rage.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.480]   Yeah, altered states.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.200]   Yeah, you get in there and you're floating and then they close the lid and you can't
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.360]   see anything and it's a sensory deprivation tank they call it.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.360]   I like that it has a big on off button right in the front there.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.200]   It looks like a mac and Dutch egg.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.640]   Uh, okay.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   All right.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.640]   I'm bored.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.640]   Okay.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:46.640]   I'm bored to tears.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.840]   This is why I watch YouTube, frankly, I don't always try to.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.000]   I'm sure this is the right one.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.840]   No, cause now she's in the vomit comment later.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.920]   Later she gets to do this.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.640]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:04.680]   And by the way, do you really want to be in a room with 20 people called the vomit comet?
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.680]   Loading.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:07.680]   Really?
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:13.280]   Do they check to see if you're going to vomit before you go up?
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:17.640]   And then how long is it the period of weightlessness is 15 seconds, 20 seconds.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.760]   It's, it's a several 30 second.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.200]   Oh, it's pretty long, but they added it together.
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.720]   So you feel like you're weightless for a long time, but you're not.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.880]   Cause that's something that she shows you, she shows you not the experience of going
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.160]   to the ground and coming up to go.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.880]   If they put a window in that thing, you truly vomit.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:35.880]   So, okay.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:36.880]   Go did it better.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:37.880]   That's all I'm going to say.
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:42.280]   I am going to, you know, it's, I'm doing it right now because you inspired me.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.360]   This is, this is a, okay.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.640]   Go does the best music videos ever.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.400]   You've had them all and actually to talk about some of them.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.880]   This one they did in the vomit comedy.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.880]   It's super insane.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:56.120]   But they, they, they put it for a solid week to do this.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.120]   Oh yeah.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.120]   They had to rehearse and like crazy because well, you'll see why in a second because they
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.800]   can only do it 30 seconds at a time.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:03.800]   Right?
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:09.720]   So this entire video is shot in 30 second increments in, in, in, it doesn't look like
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:14.720]   they're weightless, but they, but they obviously they are.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:16.680]   It's pretty well done.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.000]   I showed it to my daughter and she didn't know what to expect.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.480]   And when he did that, she was just like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:28.040]   But see that, you got to cut against United Airlines.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.360]   Now you got to cut because they have to freeze and then the plane has to go up in the air
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.880]   again to another parabola.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.800]   These guys work so hard in their videos.
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.800]   I don't, I just don't, I just don't.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.040]   I have no sense of how good music is.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.040]   Right.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:49.040]   The music's only mediocre.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.800]   These guys became famous with the treadmill video, which was a very clever video.
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.320]   This was, they were just starting out.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.520]   This was, that was about, gosh, we, I think we showed that on tech TV.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.320]   So 15 years ago, I guess.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:06.760]   Make the candidate that long ago.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:10.320]   So yeah, you're right.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.320]   The music is secondary.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:18.080]   But these guys must, they must have such a hard time because you've got to, got to top
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.680]   themselves every single time.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.840]   It's got to be hard, right?
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:23.320]   It's got to be so hard.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.080]   So I'm going to be able to just pull up.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.280]   I will look now.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:32.920]   I, yeah, we interviewed them on the, this, this two should be this, this, this, not this.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.560]   Oh, what is this now?
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.360]   This is the United Airlines drag defense.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.280]   This is some everybody ought to learn here.
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:45.280]   It's a good instructor.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.280]   You guys know I couldn't make this video without providing some very effective, gracy,
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.280]   drag defenses for men, women and children, whether you're getting dragged off a plane
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.280]   or through a dollar general store.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.280]   The secret is to get your legs between you and the attack.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.280]   If only he had done that.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.280]   He kicks the guy in the face.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.280]   He does a scissor.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.280]   He's out.
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:08.280]   If he's standing a little bit taller, place both feet on the hips, elevate, rotate, drop
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.280]   and lock helicopter.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.280]   Actually for all we know he did because didn't he escape from the police officers and right
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.280]   back onto the plane.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.120]   Last but not least, if you have a change of heart during your drag defense and you actually
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.240]   want to give your seat to the United employee, simply put them to sleep, tuck them in and
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.720]   get off the plane before they reach out.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.720]   Wow.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:32.400]   You know the airlines drag defense by printer and Ryan and Gracie.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.480]   If we talk about this, this, this goes back.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.480]   I read this, I put a link in the show notes.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:44.400]   This was a very nice and it'll fit with Leo, your hatred of all things Twitter and kind
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.880]   of idea of lazy journalism.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.720]   But and I did notice this too.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.560]   When I was reading the United coverage, people couldn't decide if the plane was overbooked
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:16:00.000]   or if it was, you know, they wanted the employees to take the ride or what was going on.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.120]   And so this person broke it down talking to some aviation lawyers about what happened
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:09.920]   and really kind of excorciated the media for their coverage.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.320]   I don't think them.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.480]   No, I don't.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.080]   It's been hot and cold.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.160]   It has been really.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.720]   You don't you don't drag people out of a plane like that.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.040]   There were there has to be a better way.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.040]   There had to be a better way than doing that.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.880]   Nobody denies that United had the right to do that.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:31.160]   So the point though is if you're a journalist, you have to like I totally believe you have
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160]   to get beyond.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.400]   Hey, this terrible thing.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.400]   Yes, no, I agree.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.400]   Yes, you're right.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:40.360]   And that's that's that's fine for your first take on the PBS NewsHour.
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:45.320]   They that it was it was a very surface, you know, it was the headlines.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.320]   Yeah, and a man was dragged off United Airlines plane.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.760]   They even mentioned that it was Republic that it was a United Express plane.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:56.440]   And anyway, we'll be fun to watch the lawsuit to develop.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.960]   Yeah, but your state so you're right.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:16:59.960]   There were issues there.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.400]   There was another plane on the other end that wouldn't have taken off and all those
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.400]   people would have been inconvenienced.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.800]   If that they got there.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.480]   Yeah, all of that's true, but there had to be a better way that was there had to be
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.480]   a better way.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.360]   Now, at some point, going to pay a huge price.
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.280]   They're very lost several hundred million dollars in their stock price.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.640]   This is not how a company operates.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.640]   It's terrible.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.640]   It's a very much a new news.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.040]   No, we don't treat our people that way.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:23.600]   The CEO finally after three days, he said, you know, I'm sorry.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.600]   Well, it took Sean Spicer more times to apologize for the
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.600]   following.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.000]   So I figured the new standard.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.400]   No, but okay.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:37.760]   So is it just coincidence or I think we've reached critical mass of Twitter outrage,
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.240]   because we got the Pepsi thing.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:42.520]   We got the Sean Spicer thing and we got the United thing.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.640]   It's this is this is those are all happened in space of a few days.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:48.120]   Is this not going to happen now from now on like every week?
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.480]   There'll be a new outrage.
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:53.680]   Yeah, this is I don't I still like Twitter.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.480]   I still get a lot of great stuff on it.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:59.760]   I'm not going to be switching to Mastodon anytime soon because I'm not technically
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.880]   well, I wouldn't switch to Mastodon.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.000]   All right, let's talk about Mastodon Kevin Marks it apparently, which I didn't realize
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.840]   had introduced Mastodon in October on this show.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.040]   I actually went back and watched the tape.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.880]   It November.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:20.600]   So this is a simply a Ruby on rails interface to something called O status.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:24.920]   And you probably you all know O status because we had an O status.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:32.000]   I identical serve with the Twit Army in 2008, which I set up taking great pains with Evan
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.920]   Prodrom with a guy who wrote identical.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.600]   Identica became and correct me when I go wrong on this Kevin because it's it's identical
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.280]   became status.net.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.160]   I think Evan sold it and then he still owns that sonnet.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.360]   He just changed the name.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.960]   Okay, he changed the name.
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:49.960]   Go ahead.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.960]   Carry on.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:57.520]   So, so, so status net was was the company was trying to commercialize it with he was
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.800]   trying to make another Twitter.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.480]   He literally was trying to make another Twitter.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.640]   Well, he made another Twitter.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.760]   He made, you know, he made a thing that worked, but he built it on top of open source in the
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.600]   silence, which was interesting.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.440]   Yeah, interesting good work.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:17.320]   So, so O status was his name for the collection of specs that he used in it, which are at
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:24.440]   them for the feeds pub sub hub, which is now called web sub and went to kind of recommendation
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:29.640]   into a three C this week, which is the way you notify people as soon as you've updated.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.640]   So that's the push.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.640]   The push technology.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.960]   Yes, effectively, that's the push technology.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:40.280]   And then the two other components to other components to other components that were incorporated
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:47.040]   were web finger, which was a, it's a slightly over complicated way of looking up username
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.120]   at domain.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.400]   And there was a protocol that was put together to let you look up these names and domains
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:57.760]   that involves doing a fetch of doing three or four fetches from the site and doing a bunch
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.400]   of stuff to look it up and then deciding where the domain is.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:06.240]   Whereas actually just saying domain at username works on these instances just easily.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.200]   But this was a, there's a protocol for doing that.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.720]   And it lets you get a bunch of endpoints without fetching the page.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:16.120]   So it makes us it's one of these protocols where we built this complicated thing and then
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.600]   we went, that's more complicated than we need it to be.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.840]   And it's sort of mostly rotted, but it.
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.640]   But you never replaced it or did anything else with it.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.720]   You just, you let it lie.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:26.720]   Oh, no.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.960]   Well, this is the thing about standard open source.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.040]   You make a standard people can still implement it.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.320]   You create an open source implementation to conceal bills on that.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.320]   So, so sorry.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:44.000]   So status net at our became GNU social, which has been, you know, has been maintaining people
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.760]   of running instances of that for a long time.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.480]   You told us about that maybe a year or two ago.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.640]   In fact, because of you, I signed up for one of the GNU social instances, quitter.no,
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.400]   which looks just like Twitter.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.840]   So, so this is it.
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:02.560]   So GNU social, like call GNU social looks more like a blogging system.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:06.040]   And the quitter thing, quitter.se was the first one.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:11.760]   They gave it this, this Twitter like skin, which was built, this was built four years
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.760]   ago, maybe.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.000]   And it looks like old Twitter.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   It doesn't look like current Twitter.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.920]   But it looks like Twitter looked like 2000.
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:18.920]   Which a lot of people like.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:19.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:24.440]   No, but also it, it means that people who are used to Twitter, like spacey doesn't want
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.600]   to do with this stuff can go, oh, I know how to use this.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.360]   It looks familiar and it kind of works.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.600]   And then you go, but it does quite well at the same as Twitter.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.600]   What's going on?
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.600]   There's some other pieces.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.000]   And the big problem with it, of course, is as you can see, I'm following three people
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.240]   four people, one of them is Kevin Marks.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.520]   The other one's Corey Doctorow.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:44.920]   I mean, it's a very, it never really kind of, I mean, it's, it's very geeky and it was
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:45.920]   cool though.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.240]   I like it and I've maintained my account.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.640]   And then you told us about a Gargron.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:55.080]   Who, yes, not his real name, by the way.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.240]   That's his handle.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.240]   His name is Eugene.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:05.280]   But he's, so he built, he re-printed it from scratch in a different, you know, he put it,
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.800]   the classic ones in PHP and runs the lamp stack.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.720]   He re-built it in Ruby on Rails using a React front end.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.000]   And his front end looks more like Tweetback.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.840]   So the Mastin front end has this multi-column thing going on.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.440]   So you've got, you know, you've got four columns.
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.280]   You can see it here.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.640]   And by the way, it has a limit of 500 characters.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:29.640]   So you stretch this to show how you can, you can make a long post.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.640]   You can also put in images.
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.000]   It has some nice features.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.800]   You can choose per post privacy, kind of like Facebook, unlike Twitter, direct private
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:43.920]   to followers only, unlisted does not show public timelines.
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:48.240]   You can also put in, you can also put in this content warning.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:53.520]   So don't look at this and then put something in there.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.880]   And then, so this is really handy.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:01.040]   In fact, people have used it, interestingly, for political posts, like you type politics
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.200]   and then say something political.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.840]   And people who didn't want to see it wouldn't have to see it.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:08.840]   So I'll toot that.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:09.840]   It's called a toot, not a tweet.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:14.440]   And you see that the tweet, the toot here says politics and then show, as a show more
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.440]   button.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.440]   I like that.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.440]   The columns are home.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.920]   This is, this is the people I follow.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.880]   This is like the Twitter home column.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.880]   Notifications also very much like Twitter with some of the same kind of controls.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.080]   You can choose what you see in the notifications column.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.960]   It's where you get interesting is in this third column, Kevin.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:36.160]   It's the, it could either be the local timeline or the federated timeline.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.160]   Tell us about that.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.160]   Okay.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:44.560]   So, so the way this works is, so the first column is the people you've chosen to follow.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.440]   The local timeline is everyone who's on the same instance as you are.
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.400]   So we better explain Federation and instances then.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.400]   Yes.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:59.720]   So in a way, it's like an old group blog from 2002 or so where we would all sign into the
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:03.080]   same blog and have a conversation on that blog because communication between blog was
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.080]   awkward.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:09.120]   So you can, you, when you sign into a master instance, you, anyone you refer to with an
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.800]   app will be on the same instance as you and you can have a conversations between them.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:16.680]   And it feels like a, it's Twitter.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.600]   If there was only one, there's only one Twitter.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:19.600]   That's it.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.600]   You're in that silo, right?
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:24.440]   But it's also, you're like, you know, a lot of known runs this way as well.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:29.560]   So one of the things that known as built with, with, with, with with known is doing this
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.920]   kind of site for education where you will set up a site for your whole class and they'll
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.560]   have a conversation within the site, even though they connect outside the site as well.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:41.880]   So it's a similar idea of giving you a sort of peer group to connect to.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:46.360]   So the local, the local timeline is the set of people who are on the same server as you
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.960]   who signed up for the same one.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:53.040]   So the, the master and social was the, was the initial one that you gen set up, but there's
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:56.720]   a bunch of other ones that may set up over the last couple of weeks that have different
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.720]   themes and different people.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.920]   Think of it like email.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.480]   So you could be on Yahoo mail and you'd, I'd be Leo at Yahoo mail.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:06.600]   I could also have Leo at Gmail and, and, and they're federated.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.440]   So I can send a message from Gmail to Yahoo mail.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.640]   So it's kind of like that.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640]   Right.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.640]   So I'm, so if I were just, this is like local timelines, just people on Yahoo mail and the
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:20.400]   federated timeline is other massive instances.
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.000]   How many, there are thousand now, a couple of thousand now, right?
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.880]   Um, I'm not sure is that how many though?
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.280]   It's growing like Topsy.
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.280]   It became very popular.
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.080]   There's a few hundred master ones.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:33.120]   There's a few hundred, um, convolution social ones and they, they interoperate as well.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.120]   They're going to operate between them.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.120]   Not fast.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.800]   So the local timeline is everyone who's on, who's on the same server as you and what
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.080]   they're saying.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:46.080]   And then the federated timeline is, um, everyone who's on the same server as you plus all the
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.560]   people they follow from other servers.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.760]   So it's not the total universe, but just people follow that on your server.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:53.760]   Yes.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.080]   So it's like one degree of a friend of a friend.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.080]   Right.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.080]   Um, there's no way to follow the total timeline.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.080]   No.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.080]   Okay.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.080]   Well, not without running a crawler.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.080]   Okay.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.680]   You could you get the whole fire hose?
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.440]   Could you get the whole fire hose?
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:13.480]   Um, you'd have to, if theoretically you'd have to subscribe to every user in every instance.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.520]   Some instances are trying to do this.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:19.840]   They're creating follow bots, uh, which go out and try to follow it.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.840]   It's almost like crawling mastodon.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.040]   They try to follow everything they can find.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:28.640]   And then that way you would your federated timeline, if you're on that particular instance,
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:32.440]   would, would be approximation of the total, uh, universe.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.440]   Yes.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.000]   And, you know, you could run it, you know, I built the technology thing that did this
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000]   for blogs.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   You can write a crawler that, that crawls everything and tries to collect it all, but
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.720]   it'd be, you know, you're going to be investing a lot of money on servers to do that.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.680]   Um, but the point of this is you can.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:53.440]   So the way to think about this is you don't, nobody can read the whole of Twitter either.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.080]   That, that, that's an impossibility.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:01.160]   Now in, in 2007 you could, 2007 Twitter had a public timeline that was everything that
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.160]   everyone posted ever.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.040]   And it was just, it was one of the choices on the front page.
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:09.240]   Um, and they turned that off after a while because it would go past so fast you couldn't
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.240]   read it.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.040]   Um, and it became unusable.
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:18.200]   And so what, what the goal of the local timeline is to give you a subset of that.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.120]   And then the, and also it's relatively cheap to produce because they're all on the same
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.120]   machine.
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:27.440]   And then the, um, the federated timeline here or the whole network as they call it in, in
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.280]   GNU social is one step beyond that a step further.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:36.440]   But if you go to a different instance, you will see a different, you know, um, federated
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:41.160]   timeline because it depends on who's people on that instance are followed as well.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.960]   So you know, you're, you're on two instances.
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.720]   So you can, you can switch between it and see different things on, on those two.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:54.080]   Why has, I mean, I guess there were a number of articles in the last couple of weeks, uh,
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.200]   Lance Ewanoff wrote one saying forget it.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.200]   This thing's going to die.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:01.960]   In fact, that's the obvious thing to say is, oh, we've seen this all before, uh, which
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.720]   we have, uh, behalf.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.400]   I mean, so so what?
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:09.840]   And then, and then another kind of straw man raised is, well, it's not going to replace
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.120]   Twitter, but I don't think that's the intent.
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.840]   In fact, one of the reasons I use it does, it has kind of replaced Twitter for me because
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:19.960]   the conversations are very nice and pleasant and geeky and I have a great time talking
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:20.960]   to people.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.640]   Um, you're talking to what?
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.640]   Five, six people?
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:27.360]   Oh no, it's more than that, but it's, you know, it's, it's not, well, it's not you, Jeff.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.720]   And it's not Stacy.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.720]   Kevin's there.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:30.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.080]   There are a hundred, a hundred, some thousand people.
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.080]   So, right.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.080]   So here's the thing.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.920]   So I saw, I saw Dave Weiner at the conference.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.320]   I was on this week and I said, Dave, what happened to blogging at the early, early days
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.960]   of blogging, it really was wonderful.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:45.320]   I met all these people who thought differently from me and from around the world.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.400]   We all saw our differences and we all got along and yeah, we disagreed, but it was basically
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:52.800]   civil and Dave said everything is nice at the most arts.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:53.800]   Right.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:54.960]   That's why I like it.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.960]   Right.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:57.960]   Fresh shiny new.
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:04.240]   So, now there is, it does have some features that might help with abuse.
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:10.200]   For one thing, it's not, it's not some faceless person at Twitter that's deciding what's abuse,
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.200]   right?
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.200]   It's the person who runs the instance.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:13.200]   Mm.
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:14.200]   That's interesting.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:19.440]   So, you've got some separate, so you can set up a CUNY instance and make it about what
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.920]   you're talking about, what your conversation is and you can decide who you federate with
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:25.880]   and who you show on the public, it's timeline, who you brought completely.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:30.800]   So apparently there are some nasty, uh, mastodon, you know, white, white supremacist
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:34.480]   gnats, mastodontist, but nobody federates with them.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:38.440]   So in effect, they have a nice local thing and you don't see it.
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.040]   They plot revolution on their own.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:41.040]   Right.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.840]   Well, this is, this is what happened with quitter in the first place.
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:53.640]   If you remember, quitter.se got a huge influx of users for one Twitter, a few already, whatever.
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:59.120]   At some point, Twitter banned somebody and the sort of alt-right types said, "We need
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:00.120]   something better than this."
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:06.320]   They turned up a quitter.se and the Swedish guy who ran it was like, "No, actually, I'm
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:10.440]   a communist," and he put the communist manifesto on the front page.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:14.400]   So if you want to set up your own alt-right instance, I'll show you how to do that, but
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:18.240]   you really shouldn't be on this one because you won't fit in.
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:24.080]   And there was, you know, Instapund it went there for a bit and there was a sort of little
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.520]   rebellion thing going on there.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.840]   And then they set up, what's that thing?
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:35.520]   Or there's some annoying like frog themed, Twitter-alike thing that isn't, doesn't federate properly
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.480]   in it, is trying to be its own thing.
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:39.520]   So that they ended up there instead.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:51.120]   And there are other social instances that have a strong, what they call, their point
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:57.760]   of view is we are strongly free speech and that they don't take into account that speech
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:01.920]   can hurt people and so that they're sort of anti-censorship in that sense.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:08.000]   So they're in the sort of ACLU at Skokie School of Free Speech as opposed to the, that actually
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.120]   suppresses certain kinds of speech things.
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:13.360]   So there are instances that have different moderation policies and then there are rules
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:16.040]   about who federates with whom and debates about what's going on there.
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:21.800]   So there is a lot of that kind of who federates with whom drama going on as well.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:27.880]   The interesting thing that, sadly, most on social is that the people who turned up there
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:32.840]   and there's been inflexive different groups of people have spent a bunch of time saying,
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.680]   well, what would it be like, the reason it's got these kinds of features of being able
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:41.800]   to put content, one of the things like that was that you should listen to the people who
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:44.400]   turned up and said, wouldn't it be nice if we had this?
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.600]   And he said, well, we could do that.
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.560]   And let me try that and just see if that works.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:50.720]   And he spent a lot of time doing that kind of community management stuff and listening
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:51.720]   to what people have built.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:57.200]   And I think I linked an article about this that was, where did I put this, somewhere
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.440]   in the, it's in the master's perspective.
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:02.800]   So we're thinking of doing, for instance, no agenda's already done one, Adam, Kerry,
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.400]   and John de Vorex show.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:07.200]   We were thinking of doing a Twitch instance.
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:12.120]   So the local Twitch instance would be people like you see in the chatroom, our hosts and
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:14.200]   so forth, communicating.
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.320]   And if you didn't want to see anything but that, you would never look at the federated
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.320]   timeline.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.240]   You would never follow anybody outside the timeline.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:23.280]   And you would just be in that little tight little community.
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.560]   You could peek out if you want.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:29.400]   And so it's kind of a nice mixture of private and public.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:33.560]   I'm fascinated by it mostly because it's not siloed.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.840]   There's lots of other issues.
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:39.800]   For instance, you don't own your name in any respect, which has actually been a good
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:40.800]   thing.
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:41.800]   It's kept most of the brands out.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:45.800]   So the Verge can register as they have an account on one instance, but there could be
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:50.720]   a Verge on every single instance because the namespace is the instance name.
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:55.680]   So I'm at Leo@masterdont.network, but I'm also at Leo@masterdont.social.
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:59.480]   And I'm also at Leo, actually Leo LePort at Twitter.no.
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:01.040]   I only use one of those.
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:05.680]   But if I start a Twitter instance, I could also be at Leo@toot.toot.tot.tv.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.220]   And somebody else could be at Leo@masterdont.
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:12.880]   No, you post the one and you say, on all the other ones, you say, "Follow me."
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.880]   This is my canonical one.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:18.440]   You at least have multiple email addresses, right?
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:22.320]   And you tell people which email address works, but there's a positive.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.720]   Yes, but I don't know that I know what it is.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.120]   There's no verification system.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:36.120]   OK, so you can verify this stuff.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:37.120]   I've built this.
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.640]   You can do it as a verification.
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:42.600]   You link to between them with Realmees and you can see which one is connected to the
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:43.600]   other ones.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:46.320]   And that's actually better than a verification that depends on the site, only the site.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.320]   You can verify yourself.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.120]   There's also an ad hoc verification system.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:55.840]   A number of us on Keybase have used things to ad hoc verifiers.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.480]   So you can verify that's Leo because it's on his Keybase page.
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:05.560]   But the point is that you have a username added domain, which is like having a blog
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:11.680]   and a domain or having a Tumblr thing with a username or it's like having an email address.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.520]   What you don't have is a global name space because the global name space would imply
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:17.000]   there's only one instance.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000]   Which I like.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000]   This is what was the naive about Lance.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.800]   You can't have a global name space.
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:23.800]   This would die.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:26.960]   Actually, the things that don't have global name space and things that don't die.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:29.960]   The ones that have a single name space are the ones that die.
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:38.840]   And if you don't believe me, I've got a page full of them at indiewoven/sitedads.
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:43.000]   So you know the idea of antifragility?
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.640]   Antifragility says if you build something that can cope with bad things happening to
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.000]   it, it gets stronger over time and it becomes antifragile.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.520]   And the web is antifragile.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.320]   The linking is this antifragile thing.
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:57.000]   Yes, a lot of links break, but overall the web retains itself.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.520]   People who have worked around into it.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:05.080]   If you build something that tries to protect you from that fragility of the web and of links
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:09.440]   and everything is only on one instance, then what happens one day when that site goes down,
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.440]   you lose a huge chunk of the web in one go.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.080]   And we've seen that happen over and over again.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:18.000]   We've had sites that people build their lives on and they get bought by a big company
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.640]   and then they're getting old and they die.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:26.000]   If you want a nice example of that upcoming, upcoming was this site where you posted events
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000]   that were happening.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000]   It was a community site.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.200]   It got bought by Yahoo, they ran it for a while, they got fed up and bought and it died.
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:37.360]   And then Scott Payo, Scott Payo, Andy Payo, Scott Payo is another guy.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.440]   Andy Payo bought it back.
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:42.280]   And he's really long shit.
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.680]   It's actually up and running now.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:46.280]   What's beautiful is apparently he had the old databases.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:47.960]   So he's imported all the old databases.
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.120]   So you can go back in time and look at events in the past.
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:52.760]   That was kind of weird.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:56.920]   Because I made an event on upcoming for like when Back to the Future happened and now it's
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:00.200]   in the past, which is like, that's kind of freaky.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:06.200]   No, so the point is that actually what happens when you say, okay, I'm going to build a site
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:13.800]   that does everything, you're creating fragility debt because it's only one site and it lasts
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:18.560]   only as long as you have funding, you have interest and you don't get bought by somebody
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:20.080]   who then shuts it down.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:23.160]   Whereas if you build something out of protocols, the protocols can last longer than the thing
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.160]   itself.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:28.480]   And Mastin has a good example of that in that.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:36.800]   Evan built, you know, identical status net and both the protocol suite and then decided
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.520]   he was going to do something else and he's built pump.io, which is a new protocol and
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.240]   is a pretty better design protocol.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.520]   There's a bunch of standardization work that he's been working on for updating this stuff.
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.160]   But the sort of protocol suite and the code suite that he had has been sitting out there
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:53.360]   and has implementations running and has just got picked up by somebody else.
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.680]   So we have this thing that is these systems have been running for a while and suddenly
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.640]   it got popped through in the last two weeks.
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.280]   It's kind of fun to have a community.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.920]   I mean, you wander into a community.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:03.920]   It's like a party.
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:08.400]   And so I think the concern about is this going to last or not last is really misguided.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.920]   If it's fun now, do it.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:13.000]   I've spent a lot of time over the last week because it's fun.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000]   It's great.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000]   It's a nice group of people.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.760]   I mean, you know, there are people who still use NNTP, you know, these protocols don't
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.760]   actually die.
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.760]   No.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.160]   How about Manton Reese and micro dot blog?
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.160]   Where's this?
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:31.280]   Because I paid I paid into that and I guess we're waiting for our invites to that.
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:33.360]   That's a kind of similar idea, right?
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.360]   Yes.
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:38.760]   Well, that's that's built on the more of the indie web protocols as well.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:44.160]   So that's built on microparbund and web mention, whereas which is the sort of the new generation
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:45.160]   of these protocols.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:49.680]   And it's also built on web servers as well to give you the real time part.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.160]   So there's some overlap between them.
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.120]   And part of what we're trying to do, what I would be trying to do.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:58.440]   That would be almost like having your own blog be your mastodon site.
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.080]   You microblog there.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.080]   It goes to your blog.
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.080]   It can be federated.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:03.080]   Others can see it.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.080]   So it's a little more personal.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.720]   I mean, almost like running your own personal instance that you're the only member of.
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:08.720]   Yes.
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:14.720]   The interesting thing here is this thing of running an instance for a set of other people
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.200]   and giving them a place to converse.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.200]   Yeah, like Twitter.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.200]   But you can do that.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:21.200]   You can do that with blogs too.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.800]   This was the thing that you did with blogs.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.000]   There was if you remember.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.320]   It was in scale well though because you can't have a thousand people in a group blog.
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:33.960]   But these things fall over a few thousand two.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.720]   One of the reasons people have been selling new instances is because they've hit flat.
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:45.080]   Part of this, and I linked an article by Lexi that describes some of these problems, but
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:51.440]   there's a problem is that my SQL databases aren't designed to deal with networks.
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:55.320]   And so you get this sort of order and square thing that happens is you try and scale them
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.320]   up.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.320]   That makes it quite hard to do.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:58.320]   And Twitter started somewhere.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.720]   Twitter started out with a Rails app that was using a MySQL database and it worked for
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:03.720]   a while.
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:05.040]   Well, you all remember the fail well.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.480]   By the way, Mastodon has its own fail Mastodon, I believe.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:10.240]   Yes, it's apparently the fail well.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.240]   It's the Mastodon.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.240]   It's the best of a big time.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:17.680]   But it's, but you know, eventually you have to restructure things and build it differently
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:22.520]   when you're trying to scale to millions of users rather than thousands of users.
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:27.680]   And so if you want them all to be in one site and want to be fast, you have to do a bunch
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:30.640]   of massive retorning and that's that's quite hard to do.
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:36.400]   Whereas what this says is we'll build up so it works for a few, you know, a few hundred
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.040]   or a few thousand users and then we'll federate between them and we've got some protocols
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.040]   that make that work.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.360]   Does the federation pretty efficient?
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.160]   I mean, it can handle a lot more traffic.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.960]   There's, you know, there's ways to optimize all of it.
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:55.520]   The reason the web sub was invented was to sort of the classic blogging thing was I publish
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:56.520]   my blog.
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:59.960]   I'm going to read there and you check my feed every hour and see if I've posted something
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:00.960]   new.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:03.640]   And that works if there's like a few of you doing that.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.480]   But if I've got a thousand people who would check me once an hour, then my site's going
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.200]   to be in pain from that.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:13.080]   And so what web sub does is reverse that and say, okay, you registered with the web
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.280]   sub server.
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:18.320]   When I post something, I tell the web sub server and then it calls all the people who've subscribed
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.760]   to me and says, hey, Kevin's written something new.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.120]   You take that now.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:26.120]   And so rather than you all going to my site saying, don't think yet, don't think yet,
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.160]   at the point when I post, it then calls you and says, Kevin's post is something and then
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.600]   you can update your thing quickly.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:34.360]   So that's how you get a response to the back loop.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:38.880]   And you said this was a version of, oh, I screw this up.
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:39.880]   Pub Pub Sub Pub.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:41.880]   It's my favorite name.
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.640]   It's called web sub now, unfortunately.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:44.640]   It is.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.640]   Okay.
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:46.640]   Pub sub Pub was much better.
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:47.640]   Okay.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.440]   I was like, this sounds like that.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:51.000]   I can never remember the right order.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.200]   It uses Pub sub Pub but it uses some other stuff too.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:57.520]   So Pub Pub, it's designed to solve that problem.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:06.440]   It was written by Brett and Brad probably 10 years ago now, which was the problem was
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:10.800]   as your blog gets popular, it's hard to keep it up because everyone's pulling you all
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.560]   the time to get your feed.
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.880]   And so they said, well, let's reverse this.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:15.880]   You don't post that often.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:19.600]   When you do post, we'll have a server and it calls the people to do that.
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:23.280]   And they have to re-register with the server every day to make sure they're still interested.
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.840]   And so there's a protocol for doing that that means you can actually distribute any
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:33.280]   of your updates in almost real time and be, you can cope with a lot of people relatively
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:35.840]   easily compared to them all trying to pull an original block.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.240]   So that was the Pub sub Pub model.
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:43.400]   And so that's now called web sub.
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.080]   We've been taking it through W3C.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:50.360]   It's now a candidate recommendation, which is the last thing before becoming an actual
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:52.480]   official W3C standard.
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.880]   So if you're interested in this stuff, go and look up that and test against it.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:02.680]   There's a site called web sub.rocks, which lets you test your stuff against it.
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:07.000]   And Mastod impasses most of the tests, which is a fun part about this.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.160]   So there's that protocol that's there.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:13.280]   The other two protocols that Mastodn uses, I mentioned web finger, which is the way of
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:17.280]   looking at addresses, which is, it works, is a bit too complicated.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:20.680]   And at one point, the big site seems to mention it and they're backed away from it,
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:22.520]   now, so we have to do something else.
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:28.800]   The other one it uses, I think, is salmon, which is a protocol for sending comments upstream
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:33.240]   so that when I comment on something, you find out about it.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:37.680]   Now, this is a protocol that is particularly over engineered because it was designed for
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:41.080]   you to be able to post comments without actually posting on your own site.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:44.920]   So they had to only exist on the web, which there's this whole back and forth about signing
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:48.080]   it and basically following it and wrapping an XML.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:51.480]   So basically the process is very complicated.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:57.240]   We have web mentioned now, which does the same thing in a much simpler way, but Mastodn
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:00.800]   and Gnew Social are built on this older protocol called salmon.
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:06.440]   And at some point, we may help them transition to something that's smoother, but that's
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:07.440]   what works out.
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:11.360]   And it does work, but it was always quite hard to implement and if you actually sort of walk
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.240]   through it, it's like, that's way more complicated than it needs to be.
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:17.400]   But you can make it work, which means that's how you get to send the replies back more
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:20.560]   quickly because you're notifying people that the replies are happening.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:25.160]   It kind of makes sense that you would have a global thing like Twitter that everybody
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:26.880]   can go to.
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.800]   It's like a news feed.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:33.440]   And but you also want, I think it's nice to have a local, a pub you can go to where you
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:37.640]   hang out with people and you meet new people and you talk and you have a little bit more
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:39.720]   elaborate conversations.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:43.280]   So I don't think it's to replace Twitter, but it's kind of cool.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:47.240]   And Garth Rahn is actually using Patreon to raise funds for it.
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:52.000]   And he's actually, I'm happy to say he's got up to like $3,000 a month now on Patreon.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.520]   So he's, he's able to make a living doing this, which is nice.
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:58.760]   I mean, he's done, he's done a really good job of running an open source project and
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:01.240]   listening to people and implementing the things that they say.
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:02.400]   It's been going on for a long time.
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:07.360]   I didn't realize, you know, that's a surprise me when you said on Mastodon, oh yeah, I showed
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.880]   you this in November.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:11.360]   I went, Oh, I must have signed up for an account.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:13.840]   Sure enough, I had and then never used it.
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:16.240]   Sure, but he'd be building it for a while before that.
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:18.240]   But the, but this.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:22.000]   Yeah, you could see this is clearly a fairly mature project.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.280]   You can install it by a Docker.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:27.960]   The hard thing for the end user is under kind of you in our standing federation.
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:32.400]   And the first thing you have to do is figure out which instance you're going to join.
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:34.120]   And there are all kinds of instances.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:36.160]   There are lists of instances.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.160]   So you can kind of, some of them have a.
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:40.120]   I was looking at those and I was like, blah.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.720]   I think you should join the witches instance.
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:43.720]   Which is sadly.
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:47.480]   Can you get that a certain size of night that they're only open to you?
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:51.480]   They're only over the APM British time, I think.
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:52.960]   Oh, excellent.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.960]   For half an hour.
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:55.360]   So you have to really jump right in.
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:56.520]   A lot of close ones.
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:57.520]   No, you have to.
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:01.640]   Yeah, a lot of, a lot of closed ones because they're so busy.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.040]   But they, there are instances with unique designs, unique flavors.
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:10.600]   But I haven't, you know, I joined a very neutral one by accident because I didn't know what
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:11.600]   to join.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:12.600]   I accident.
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.120]   Well, you know, it's, I wasn't immediately obvious.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:16.560]   I just don't join when I get, you know how I joined it?
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:20.920]   I looked at what is he had to like, he had to see on servers and he looked like he had
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:24.200]   enough horsepower not to go down every five seconds.
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:25.200]   There you go.
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:26.200]   That was it.
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:28.000]   But it's a gigahertz.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.760]   It's kind of fun.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:34.320]   I mean, I don't know how important it is, but it's kind of fun.
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:37.120]   I'm really looking forward to Manton's micro blog.
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:38.120]   I want to use that.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.480]   So now I have a WordPress blog and I will interact.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.960]   It'll work with my WordPress blog.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:44.120]   So I want to, I kind of want to use that.
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:45.640]   I'm interested in that.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.040]   So, so the way to think about this, and I, you know, I've given you the sort of the
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:53.840]   big public's hand way of thing before, but the way about this is thinking about what
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.840]   public actually means.
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:01.280]   And in the literary theory world, they talk about every piece, every work that's published
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:03.920]   has a public, which the people who read that work.
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:07.680]   And that's a better way of thinking about this saying things are either public or private.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:11.560]   And the, you know, there is a public sphere, which just meant there's a very small subset
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:14.360]   of people who read the newspapers and they're the public sphere and everyone else doesn't
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:15.360]   count.
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:19.560]   And what we have now is lots of publics that overlap to different degrees.
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:24.320]   So we have the public of people who watch, watch twig.
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.960]   And then that we have the public of people who read Jeff's blog and they intersect to
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:31.120]   a certain extent, but they're different publics.
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:36.400]   And the interesting thing about this model is that you're actually constructing layered
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:37.400]   public.
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.120]   So you're building a public, which is all the people in one instance, and then you're
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:45.340]   building a slightly bigger public, which is the people who, the people in that instance
[01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:46.400]   follows.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:51.320]   So it's made manifest this kind of sort of soft overlapping products, which is what we
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:53.440]   action actually the way we use Twitter.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:56.920]   With Twitter, we all choose to follow a set of people.
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:00.960]   And then we also get a feed of the things that they retweet, which is like the, which
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:04.240]   is like the next degree out from that.
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:08.760]   But it's, it's not, it doesn't have as hard an age as this because it's not chosen by
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:11.680]   instance, it's just, it has a softer boundary.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:17.600]   So part of what this is doing is making manifest the way that we use the web anyway.
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.880]   So I think that's a very interesting way to think about this.
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:26.280]   So, you know, obviously we want to be able to move between instances and, and this delegate
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:28.760]   stuff in more than one place.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:32.600]   But part of the interesting part that I've, I've got back from people has been, no, I
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:33.800]   don't want to connect this to Twitter.
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:35.680]   I like this being a separate thing.
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.080]   It's being different public.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:41.040]   And because Twitter is now so searchable, that means that people can come and invade
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.880]   your privacy directly by searching for things you're talking about and budding into you.
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:49.960]   Because Twitter made the replies into this sort of sticky thing that you can't get rid
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:55.440]   of because every time you reply, everyone you've ever talked to is included in reply.
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:00.960]   That is one of the reasons this has taken off in the last couple of weeks has been reaction
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:05.160]   to that, that sort of replyable feature of Twitter.
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:09.880]   So a big catalyst for this with Sarah Young writing about this and saying, I'm taking
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:12.800]   a week off Twitter, I'm going to try something else instead and going to this and then running
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:17.040]   a very good article that explained a lot of this and brought a lot of people in.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.280]   I'm having fun.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:21.720]   I'm having fun.
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:27.640]   It strikes me that if you look at Twitter as broken, there's two ways to fix it.
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:34.240]   One way is to go more open, which this did, but give you more control.
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.080]   But yet in the totality of a less control, the other way is to come up with a controlled
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:42.880]   Twitter, which I kind of dread, but kind of want at the same time.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:45.280]   And I don't know which way to go.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:47.320]   Well, you can have both.
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:51.840]   That's one that's mutually exclusive.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.640]   Or many accounts.
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:54.520]   Well, you wouldn't want it.
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:55.680]   You probably wouldn't want it.
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:56.680]   Well, you might.
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:57.680]   Okay.
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.680]   You might want it.
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:01.520]   Like for instance, I probably would keep an account on a Twitter instance and then maybe
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:02.520]   a more public account.
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:03.520]   But that's the point.
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:04.520]   It's flexible.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:05.520]   You could do.
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:06.520]   You could do both.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:07.520]   I don't know.
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:08.520]   It's fun.
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:09.520]   You should try it.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:10.520]   Yeah.
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:11.520]   Jeff and she did.
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:12.520]   So he's Stacy Carol.
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:13.520]   No, I was just, I was saying Jeff.
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.520]   We should do it.
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:21.520]   What's funny is there's a lot of people with old habits like people say like Scoble says,
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:25.120]   well, I got on and reserve my name like you could reserve your name.
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:26.120]   You can't.
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:27.120]   That's so scoble.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.120]   So scoble.
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.720]   He says, I'll see in a year if it's still around.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.560]   So there's a kind of a deep misunderstanding of what this is.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.800]   It's not it's not Twitter.
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:37.800]   It really isn't.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:38.800]   And it's not a Twitter killer.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.800]   That's nobody's proposing that.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:42.600]   Except for those dumb journalists.
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:43.600]   Okay.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:47.760]   You guys have 12 minutes before I'm going to leave and I have not heard you saying happy
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:49.640]   birthday to me yet.
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.600]   How quickly you forget?
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:52.600]   Did we not?
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:53.600]   Did we?
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:54.600]   No, we didn't.
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:55.600]   We did.
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.600]   No, no, no.
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:57.600]   We did it.
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:58.600]   It's robots.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:49:59.600]   We let the robots do it.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:00.600]   All right.
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.600]   After this break, we're going to sing happy birthday.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:02.600]   Gargle, get it, get ready.
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:06.280]   And then we'll do the pics and then we'll let Stacy go and we'll let you go to our show
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:09.880]   today brought to you by rocket mortgage from quick and loans.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:14.400]   If you are buying a new home or you're ready to refi, you've got to go to a mortgage lender
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:17.200]   you can trust who has a transparent operation.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.400]   And as far as I'm concerned, I want somebody who's going to fast and do it online.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:22.840]   I don't want to have to go in.
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:26.280]   And that's what cooking loans is doing with rocket mortgage, an entirely online mortgage
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:28.960]   approval process, everything they need.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:34.000]   You can submit with a touch of a button on your phone, on your tablet, on your laptop.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.280]   You can even do it in an open house.
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:38.200]   Check statements, pay stubs, whatever.
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.560]   Just press that button.
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:44.000]   You can even play with the rate and length of your loan in real time to make sure you
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.800]   get exactly the solution that's right for you.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.880]   And you'll get approved in minutes.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:53.080]   They turn around in minutes, not days or weeks or, in my case, the last time I bought
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:55.240]   a house, it took a month.
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:59.600]   Skip the bank, skip the waiting, go completely online.
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:00.600]   Rocket mortgage.
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:01.600]   It comes from quick and loans.
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:03.960]   Go to quickandloans.com/twig.
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:10.280]   Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:14.360]   Number 30, 30s for the geek in us all.
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:18.720]   The shy folks who don't want to go in and talk to a banker.
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:20.240]   Quickandloans.com/twig.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:23.320]   Are you ready, gentlemen?
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:24.320]   Wait, wait.
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:26.160]   Scooter X says it's his birthday, too.
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:27.160]   So we should include it.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:29.160]   Oh, Scooter X, one of our chat mods.
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:30.160]   Okay.
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:31.160]   So we got to do two.
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:32.160]   So we'll do both.
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:33.800]   We want to sing along with Google or?
[01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:36.040]   Yeah, maybe because she does a good job.
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.840]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:39.840]   Oh, we got the talent, man.
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:40.840]   Okay, ready?
[01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:41.840]   One, two, three.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.840]   Happy birthday to you.
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:44.840]   Happy birthday to you.
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:46.840]   Happy birthday to you.
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:47.840]   Happy birthday to you.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:52.680]   Happy birthday to you, the most amazing one in the whole world.
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:52:00.280]   Happy birthday to you.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:03.720]   How about that?
[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:06.800]   That was terribly awesome.
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:12.760]   I hope Scooter X feels just as loved as I do.
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:14.240]   Oh, Lardy, Lardy.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:18.480]   All right, let's do some picks and get the heck out of Dodge here.
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:20.240]   Thank you for explaining Mastodon to me.
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:23.080]   I knew Kevin would be able to do a good job of that.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:24.080]   I appreciate that.
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:25.080]   I can keep trying.
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:26.440]   Well, I get it now.
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:30.800]   I get it now, and I like it well enough.
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:32.720]   Stacy, you got a good pick for you.
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:34.080]   This, by the way, episode 400.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:36.760]   So happy birthday to Twig to 400 episodes.
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:37.760]   Wow.
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:39.760]   I'm feeling very old.
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:41.480]   Why don't you take the audience?
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:43.240]   How many hours have you wasted with those audience?
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:44.240]   How many hours?
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:45.760]   I'll get them thinking about that.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.760]   We wasted.
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:47.760]   It's not wasted.
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:49.560]   We're with friends.
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:55.880]   If this were a full-time job and you're getting paid $10 an hour, you'd have $8,000 now.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:56.880]   Mm.
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:59.960]   How about that?
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:00.960]   That's pretty good.
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.640]   I'll use some money, I think.
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:05.480]   Stacy, you're pick of the week.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:06.480]   It's a good invoice.
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:07.480]   Okay.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.480]   It's a good invoice.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:12.920]   My pick of the week is to address everybody out there who's asking me about light switches
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:16.320]   that are Wi-Fi and dimmable.
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.320]   So this is hard.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:18.320]   What about that?
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:19.320]   Lutron won.
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:21.080]   Whatever that you told me to get.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:22.080]   Okay, so Lutron is not Wi-Fi.
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:24.880]   You have to buy the hub to get it on your Wi-Fi.
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:26.480]   So this is a standalone for $50.
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:29.240]   Let me put it the right way.
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:33.640]   This is the Leviton Decora 5 Wi-Fi switch.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:34.640]   There it is.
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:36.520]   It's $50 on Amazon.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.320]   And again, it's a switch.
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:42.320]   You have to install the Leviton app on your phone.
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:48.600]   But from there, you can look it to your Echo account and then you can use voice to turn
[01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:51.120]   this on or off.
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:52.120]   So that is--
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:53.520]   Including Amazon Echo.
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:55.520]   Nice.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.520]   It doesn't come with an Amazon Echo.
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.520]   No.
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:53:59.520]   It's separately.
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:02.640]   And it also has, I should say, a double faceplate.
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:07.920]   So it's white or almond comes in the box if you have a preference.
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:14.960]   It sets back to a neutral, which is good because if you have connected bulbs, it's
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:18.440]   not going to break your bulbs when you turn it on and off.
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:19.440]   So that's good.
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:22.280]   The dimmer function doesn't go all the way down to dim.
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:23.280]   It doesn't go-- oh, sorry.
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:24.280]   It doesn't go to off.
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:26.120]   So you have to hit the button.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:28.800]   So that's kind of a downside.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:33.680]   And it also has these words on it, which I'm kind of like, guys, we don't have to brand
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:34.680]   everything.
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:35.680]   Oh, man.
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:37.680]   That's on the faceplate, the visible faceplate.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:39.680]   Oh, that's a bummer.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:41.320]   That is a bummer.
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:44.320]   So that is my pick for you all.
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:45.320]   Thank you.
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:48.320]   And you're going to have a wonderful-- what's your favorite sushi?
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:50.160]   You're going to sushi tonight.
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:51.160]   OK.
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:52.320]   I like the sea urchin sushi.
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.320]   Oh, that's good.
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:54.320]   But only when it's fresh.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.320]   So the uni--
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:56.320]   Is that uni?
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:58.320]   OK.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:54:59.320]   Yeah, it's baby diaper.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:00.320]   No.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:01.320]   That's good.
[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:02.320]   It's delicious.
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:03.320]   I like the ebbie, the ama, ebbie.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:06.920]   I like the spicy tuna.
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:09.520]   I know that's a tourist sushi.
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:10.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:13.520]   I like the spider roll with a soft shell crab.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:14.520]   I like that too.
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.520]   Now a hungry sushi.
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:16.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:17.520]   Now a hungry--
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:18.520]   I ate tourist sushi.
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:20.320]   I don't eat sushi with big hunks of raw meat on it.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:21.320]   Raw fish on it.
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:22.320]   I don't know what that is.
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:23.320]   I do.
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:24.320]   I love it.
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:28.840]   Well, my sushi tip is, read the things on the rolls and order the one that is mostly
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:34.040]   fish and doesn't have crab or tam, tempura, cream cheese.
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:35.040]   Cream cheese.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.040]   Cream cheese is sacrilege.
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:37.320]   I don't know why they put cream cheese.
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:38.320]   That's disgusting.
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:39.520]   Philadelphia roll, disgusting.
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:43.960]   But basically, there's one side of the menu that is like crispy, random crab.
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:47.040]   And then there's another piece of the menu that is, we put these bits of fish together
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:48.040]   because they taste good together.
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:50.440]   And you order from that piece and that's when you get the good sushi.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:51.440]   Right.
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:54.120]   I usually do ama kasi if I can.
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:55.120]   Oh, you're a pro.
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:56.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:57.320]   Are you doing that tonight?
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:00.840]   That's the plan by my daughter who's 10.
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:02.000]   She's like, can I bring a book?
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:05.160]   Because it's going to be one of those long fancy dinners, isn't it?
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:06.160]   Oh, my cousin in the show.
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:08.160]   When the chef picks it.
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:09.160]   This is great.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:13.000]   Calvin Trillen wrote The New Yorker about taking his kids along on these food tours.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.360]   And he would say that his daughter would always bring an in-case bagel.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:21.080]   So this is-- my kids grew up in California.
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:25.320]   So for them, tuna was this red thing that you eat in sushi place.
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:26.320]   Right.
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.320]   They didn't understand tuna fish.
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:28.320]   I gave them canned tuna.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:30.080]   They were like, what is this gray nonsense?
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:31.080]   This is not too fun.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:32.400]   What is this cat food?
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.400]   It's cat food.
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:37.960]   Yeah, it's like-- Kevin, you're picking the week.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:39.560]   Your stuff this week.
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:41.400]   I've given you some bunch of stuff already.
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:44.920]   Yeah, we did upcoming.org and Andy Bios brought it back.
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:46.400]   It's wonderful, thrilled.
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:47.400]   Yes.
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:50.080]   If you want to organize events, go there, do it, try it out.
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:51.080]   It's great.
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:52.080]   It's independent.
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:53.080]   It's not going away again.
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:55.160]   He's not going to sell it again.
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:57.160]   It's just nice.
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:01.640]   Again, another nice community of people building things for each other.
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:04.640]   Web server I mentioned.
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:07.160]   There are some indie webcams coming up, indieweb.org.
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:08.160]   There's--
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:10.160]   Oh, I just booted Windows 3.
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:13.960]   Oh, I'm just going to say that one for last.
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:14.960]   Okay.
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:15.960]   Go ahead.
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:16.960]   No, go ahead.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.960]   I was just getting it started up.
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:18.960]   Wait, wait.
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:19.960]   Go on, Kevin.
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:20.960]   Sorry.
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:29.320]   So indiewebcamp.org, we have-- there's a bunch of indie webcams coming up in Europe in the
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:30.320]   next month.
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:35.200]   And there's the indieweb summit in Portland, June 24, 25, which is like the big, everyone
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:37.200]   comes together one.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:43.040]   And a lot of the indieweb work connects to these other protocols I've been talking about,
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:44.920]   and it connects to Manton's project as well.
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:47.440]   I think he's hoping to bring some of that to the summit.
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:48.880]   This is so important.
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:54.600]   And it's just-- you're doing really important work to make the web accessible and open to
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:56.920]   all and to have it all work together.
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.200]   And I'm really glad you're doing this.
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:01.000]   And indieweb.org is the website.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.760]   And a lot of this is trying to build these kind of protocols that people can then build
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:10.000]   on and surprises with interesting things like Manton and so on.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:16.400]   And one of the things we got going this week was making sure that Manton has the microformat
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:22.040]   stuff on certain interval rate with the indiewebnet when you post the link to it and so on.
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:28.160]   And I was saying this about Yuzhen being very good at listening to community and taking
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:30.200]   pull requests and following these bugs.
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:32.480]   And he has been extremely good about that.
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:35.760]   That is the reason this thing has succeeded has been that he's been listening to people
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:37.320]   and saying, oh, yeah, that would work.
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:38.320]   Oh, we should do that.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.320]   We should do that too.
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:43.240]   Yeah, I think better than Keybase, a rel.me would be fantastic.
[01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:44.240]   That would really be nice.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:45.240]   That would be good.
[01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:49.040]   I'm going to come to start with what happened to.
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:56.160]   But then the fun one and this came from Andy Bower as well is Windows 3.1 in WebVR.
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:58.160]   So go on.
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:58:59.480]   I'm going to do it now.
[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:03.600]   I did it because I thought, well, this will take a while to load as Windows 3 is wants
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.240]   to do.
[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:06.800]   Here we go.
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:11.680]   Windows for Workgroups 3.1.1 in VR.
[01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:13.360]   Well, look, Trumpet wins.
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:15.960]   Wingstock is loading.
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:19.400]   So now I can actually use this?
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:21.040]   Yes.
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:23.040]   And what does it mean that it's in WebVR?
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:24.040]   Can I?
[01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:28.360]   You can turn your head if you don't want the phone.
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:29.360]   Oh my God.
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:32.360]   You can look around.
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:33.360]   Holy cow.
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:34.760]   This is a lot of work.
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:37.760]   Somebody put a lot of work into this.
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:38.920]   What did I dial into?
[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:39.920]   CompuServe?
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:40.920]   Genie?
[01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:41.920]   Prodigy.
[01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:42.920]   Prodigy?
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:44.080]   Oh my.
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:45.800]   It runs even on a phone.
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:46.800]   Oh, I see.
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:48.720]   So as you move the phone around, I get it.
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:50.440]   They turn it round and you get the back of it.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:51.440]   I can't see it right.
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:52.440]   You get the back of it.
[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:53.440]   Oh, nice.
[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:55.840]   And it's just as slow as Windows 3.1.1 was.
[01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:57.000]   So show your kids.
[01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.800]   This is what it used to be.
[01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:00.280]   Now you're running back.
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:03.000]   I'm running back, man, which I deeply regret.
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.200]   What is it?
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:06.200]   Function all F4.
[02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:08.200]   I can't even remember.
[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:09.200]   Yep.
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:10.200]   Nope.
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:12.720]   That closed the browser.
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:14.040]   Oh, well, never mind.
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:16.080]   Thank you, Kevin Marks.
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:17.160]   Always a pleasure.
[02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:19.720]   And I'm sorry we lost you to Yorkshire.
[02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:21.920]   Oh, yeah, I'm not lost it.
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:27.240]   So there was an article in the Guardian that I'm trying to remember the name of the guy
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:28.720]   who wrote it.
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:30.080]   David Goodhart.
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:32.680]   And he said it's a different way of thinking about politics.
[02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:36.600]   He says, there are some where people and anywhere people.
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:39.520]   And the anywhere people don't really care where they are because they're connected to
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:43.000]   the world and they can relocate around the world and get stuff working.
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.760]   And I've kind of been that.
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:47.080]   But then there are some where people are saying, no, I'm in this place.
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:48.400]   This place makes sense to be.
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:49.400]   I want to live here.
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:51.560]   I want to continue in this place.
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:55.640]   And coming back to Yorkshire has been an exercise in having us somewhere again.
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:57.120]   That's where you're from originally.
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:59.040]   Well, it's where Rose is from.
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:03.840]   For me, it's for me, it's the UK as a whole, but it's definitely been connected back to
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:06.160]   family and being in a place again.
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:08.760]   I'm a somewhere person who wants to be an anywhere person.
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:11.400]   You're an anywhere person who's now somewhere.
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:12.400]   That's about right.
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:13.400]   It's nice Kevin.
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:14.400]   I'm glad to hear it.
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.120]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:17.120]   So I'll make this quickest.
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:21.560]   Stacy has a bracket her, her, her sushi waiting and it gets, you don't want stale sushi.
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:22.800]   Oh, my cause he awaits.
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:24.800]   No, no, you don't want that.
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:31.120]   So as I climb up a piece on, on box today about a study done by Levi Boxell, Matthew
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:36.680]   Grens cow and Jesse Shapiro that found that yes, American politics are broken.
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:40.800]   Yes, we're more polarized, but they found that polarization is greater among those who
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:46.280]   use the internet least, which is primarily to say older people.
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:48.280]   What media do older people use?
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:51.200]   Fox TV and talk radio.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:52.200]   Yeah, right.
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:53.200]   Yeah.
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:54.200]   It's my own dear parents.
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:57.480]   So does not to say that there isn't also polarization.
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:01.080]   It's among the young, not to say that the social media don't roll there.
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:03.120]   But the, I think that that's, that's astute.
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:04.120]   I think that's accurate.
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:06.160]   Yeah, it is, I think.
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:11.360]   And social media always gets the blame and you know, full disclosure here as I just, our
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:13.240]   university just took some money from Facebook.
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:15.240]   So I'm not doing this as a defensive case.
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:16.840]   But at least we're in a conversation.
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:17.840]   Yes, exactly.
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:20.480]   You have a sense that there's another side and you have a sense that it's there and you
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:21.480]   have to argue with it.
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:28.640]   Whereas on, on Fox News and on talk radio, all you get is the, is the one sided, proper
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:29.640]   end of you.
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:34.080]   And so they, it's really interesting research and that's my numbers.
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:36.680]   And somebody who works for years in talk radio.
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:40.480]   Of course, the real number of the week is 39.
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:41.480]   39.
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:42.480]   It's a good number.
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:45.400]   God, I've given anything to be 39 again.
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:49.040]   Oh, I was like, what, why is that the number of the week?
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:50.440]   Oh, give me a break.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:51.440]   Yeah.
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:52.440]   A little tribute.
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:57.440]   I was like, I was like, I guess I should save this because running out of time, but
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:02.000]   I Google announced a very interesting new website.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.600]   We played with a little bit yesterday called auto drive.
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:05.600]   You seen this?
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:06.600]   Yeah.
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:07.600]   I love this.
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:11.560]   So was this built on the thing they built before that was like the picture and you
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:12.560]   game?
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:13.560]   Is that, was that training this?
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:20.320]   Oh, I don't, I, you know, they don't really say exactly where it came from.
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:23.640]   It's, it's an AI experiment.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:28.120]   It uses the same, if you're learning more about magic behind auto draw, check out quick
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:30.520]   draw one of our AI experiments.
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:33.920]   It's auto draw suggestion tool uses the same technology as quick.
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:34.920]   Yeah, that was the one.
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:35.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:36.920]   Okay.
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:37.920]   So it is.
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:38.920]   So watch what's happened.
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:39.920]   So, and by the way, it's terrible.
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:40.920]   It's stick figures.
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:42.360]   So stick figures are the wrong thing.
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:48.120]   But if I draw a car, okay, it's not a very good car.
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:49.120]   I understand.
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:54.040]   But you know what auto draw knows, it's a car and says, do you mean that kind of car
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:55.520]   or that kind of car?
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:56.640]   Maybe you mean a Volkswagen van?
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:57.640]   I know it had wheels.
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:00.240]   So was it a skateboard?
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:02.160]   This is so much fun.
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:04.320]   Should we start over, do another one?
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:07.440]   How about I do a very poor happy face?
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:08.440]   I could do better.
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:10.520]   I have a pen.
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:14.960]   And then it says, oh, you meant, yeah, that's exactly what I meant or that.
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:16.920]   What if you try to draw like a group of buildings?
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:17.920]   Sure.
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:19.920]   It's not just a single object.
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:20.920]   Sure.
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:21.920]   Let's see.
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:22.920]   It happens.
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:29.720]   And look what I get.
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:31.320]   Look at that.
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:32.320]   Oh, nice.
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:34.320]   It's so super smart.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:35.320]   Or grass.
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:36.320]   Or grass.
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:37.760]   That was the other option.
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:39.120]   Or high heel shoes.
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:42.200]   I mean, it's it gives you a broad variety of things.
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.560]   And by the way, you can then use it.
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:44.560]   You could like use this.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:47.760]   You could use this with your daughter to make greeting cards and stuff, right?
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:48.760]   So you can.
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:49.760]   Yes, it's fun.
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:50.760]   You do a lot of greeting cards.
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:51.760]   I bet you do.
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:52.760]   Do you?
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:53.760]   No.
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:54.760]   We did our craft.
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:05:01.000]   We did we did our annual craft and with string eggs, which was really complicated.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.800]   For some reason, my kids, there was a lot of potato prints.
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:04.800]   I don't know.
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:07.040]   You know what we should do?
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:09.600]   And we're going to show you this on Saturday.
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:12.560]   We finally got our pancake printer working.
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:14.720]   What is that supposed to be?
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:15.720]   Batman.
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:16.720]   That.
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:17.720]   Transformers.
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:20.240]   Let me see the other one.
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:22.240]   Oh, it's up to Mrs. Primus.
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:25.720]   I'm just as primus is and this is a fish.
[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:27.720]   That's me.
[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:28.720]   Really?
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:29.720]   That's me.
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:30.720]   You got to work.
[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:31.720]   Work on it.
[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:32.720]   Darkmark excellent.
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:33.720]   We're going to show that on Saturday, the new pancake printer.
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:34.720]   We got it.
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:35.720]   We got ours.
