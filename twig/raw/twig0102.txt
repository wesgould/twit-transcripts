[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.800]   and here in the Googleplex.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.280]   Joining us now, actually in the old cottage
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.240]   for one of the last this week's in Google,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.320]   from the old cottage, the lovely,
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.400]   intended Gina Trapani.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.520]   In fact, when she comes back, she's
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.480]   going on a vacation to China.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.680]   We will be in a new facility.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.680]   So this is her last broadcast from the cottage.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.640]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.880]   I'm going to be probably asleep while the show is going on
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.680]   in China, but I will be missing you guys.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.240]   Aw, we'll miss you.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.600]   But we've been talking before the show about your trip,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.880]   but it's just going to-- I think it's just wonderful.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.640]   I'm very excited.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.200]   I'm very excited.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.480]   I will come back--
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.120]   How many days?
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.840]   Two weeks?
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.720]   Like 10 days.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.840]   It's 10 or 11 days.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.320]   Yeah, you've got to kind of make it worth the flight, you know?
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.160]   It's a long flight.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.280]   And there is a significant jet lag.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.800]   I'm sure day one, I'm going to be an absolute hot mess.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.320]   A wreck, I'm sure.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.640]   Day one, it took me about five days to get back.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.320]   Uh-oh.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.840]   Day one, yeah.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.720]   Day one.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.120]   Ambien and red wine.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.520]   There he is, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.520]   Ambien and red wine, he prescribes.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.360]   Advice on the last time.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.240]   Or just look, you could just watch some awesome announcements,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.280]   and that'll put you to sleep.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.200]   You Jeff are saying that sleeping on the plane is the key.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.840]   I presume you don't recommend an ambient and wine all the trip.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.760]   Well, that would help, too.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.600]   It wouldn't make the scenery better.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.560]   But yeah, no, ambient and red wine on the plane,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.320]   which I know is wrong.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.680]   You shouldn't mix the two and all that.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.560]   I have a little red wine.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.040]   I have an ambient.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.720]   I'm not.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.520]   No, I think that's my wife's strategy as a matter of fact.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.440]   I'm Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.000]   What the hell?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.280]   We have to show that.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.600]   Who is this?
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   Who is this?
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.920]   I'm Jeff Jarvis, TV critic for People Magazine.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.040]   Like many of you, I was disappointed.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.440]   No, make that fed up.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.720]   No one third thought, make that enraged with moonlighting.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.040]   Reruns, reruns, reruns, nothing but reruns.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.400]   I mean, without moonlighting, what was there to do on Tuesday
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.000]   nights?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.400]   Watch the Home Shopping Network, start a family, read.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.600]   Well, the crisis is over.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.960]   Moonlighting's back.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.440]   Last week, at long last, they gave us a fresh episode.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.040]   And tonight, they're giving us one that's even fresher.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.400]   But there's a catch, a hitch, a cruel trick.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.000]   If you didn't watch last week's show,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.800]   and you probably didn't bother because you figured it's
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.560]   just another rerun, then you won't
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.360]   know what the hell's happening in tonight's show.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.600]   But fear not, don't sweat.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.960]   I have right here a tape of last week's episode.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.920]   And I'll show you all the good parts.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.000]   Won't take long.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.040]   It all started when--
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.760]   OK, well, we'll skip that part.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.520]   We don't really matter.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.920]   You're going to be a lot--
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.120]   By the way, a great show.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.160]   I ran out of a crucial formula about a decade.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.040]   Yeah, between this and page one, I didn't realize that I was
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.240]   co-hosting with an absolute movie star, TV star.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.400]   I think I'm just getting an end of my aggregate career.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.920]   I'm going to use this from now on when you're not here
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.640]   or you're on phone.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.560]   We'll just put that up.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.200]   It kind of looks like you.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.920]   That's great.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.720]   No, that's great.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.640]   That really is fun.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.680]   But I think people don't know about your earlier career
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.280]   as a television critic.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.320]   I was when I was the TV critic at--
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.240]   it was a people.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.240]   And I complained in my column about how moonlighting the kids
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.760]   won't know who Civil Shepard is.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.920]   But Bruce Willis was off the air all the time
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.200]   because they were being pre-medana.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.440]   God, I loved that show.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.200]   And the producer called me up and said
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.440]   that thanks for the Valentine.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.120]   Why don't you come out and introduce the--
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.200]   It was actually quite clever.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.840]   And at the very end of that clip, there's a little gag.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   But yeah, I got to go out for the day.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.160]   I thought we all had the little gag right there.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.840]   Just kidding.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.880]   Just kidding.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.680]   I'm going to go back and we're going to see the little gag
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.040]   because I don't want to miss the little gag.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.040]   Come on.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.960]   It's YouTube.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.840]   So did you post this?
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.600]   You must have posted it.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   Oh, somebody else did it.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.880]   In fact, I actually bought-- here's the sad part.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.640]   Here's the sad egotistical part.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.640]   I got excited when moonlighting went on to DVD.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.880]   I bought it at Amazon.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.480]   I wanted to see my episode.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.840]   On DVD?
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.760]   No, I was off.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.360]   I think it's because they lost track of me
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.360]   and they couldn't get me to sign up with DVD rights, DVD
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.280]   and being a thing.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.280]   Whatever happened to Jeff Jarvis?
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.160]   Oh, that's kind of sad.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.120]   So it was very sad.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.640]   So I don't know who found this where.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.640]   But some very nice soul put it up on YouTube
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.720]   and people were laughing at me all day, which is fine.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.840]   I think it's great.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.520]   Let's watch some more of Jeff Jarvis introducing moonlight.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.440]   David decided to do just that and rush to Maddie's house
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.120]   at four in the morning to share his startling realization
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.040]   with her.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.160]   It's after this?
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.640]   After this club.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.160]   Sorry.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.040]   I think it's kind of fun doing.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.400]   Oh my god, that's--
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.960]   Mark Horvain.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.800]   That's-- some would say that's when the show jumped the shark.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.680]   It jumped Mark Horvain.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.720]   It jumped the shark when they got when they hooked up.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.040]   The sexual tension is what made that show.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.240]   Our Bruce and-- what's your name, Garouc?
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.200]   Sibile.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.040]   Sibile.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.240]   I got to get these DVDs.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.240]   Oh, have you not seen moonlighting?
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.040]   What's your question?
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.040]   Right.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.000]   Which reminds me.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.520]   I'm not part of it.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.800]   Let me make it absolutely clear that my appearance here
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.560]   on moonlighting will in no way compromise my integrity
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.840]   as a television critic.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.200]   Sure it's just a thank you note.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.600]   Good on you.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.320]   Good on you.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.800]   And you know, as long as you disclose it, it's OK, Jeff.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.240]   But Jeff, before the internet, you were actually
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.200]   difficult to find.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.520]   Is that-- is that what people was?
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.240]   I find that hard to believe in any case.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.600]   Hey, one more person to introduce who is not a regular
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   on this show, but is a regular on the network.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.720]   I, as Akhtar, is also in studio with us.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.520]   He is, of course, one of the regular hosts on Tech News
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.440]   today, every weekday afternoon on Twit Live.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.960]   And great to have you.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   Thanks for having me.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.360]   Think about Jeff's clip there.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.960]   There's no way to catch up on moonlighting.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.960]   Now you just check Twitter.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.920]   Check Google+.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.760]   It's kind of interesting to see that.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.240]   Somebody said--
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.560]   How would you know?
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.680]   As somebody said in Google+, the amazing thing was,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.360]   this recalls an era where if you missed an episode of something
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.160]   you were screwed.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.680]   Right.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.280]   That's an entirely mind-bending thing.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.240]   I know who Lou--
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.840]   I have to use a VCR to go back and forth.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.760]   If you brought it--
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.280]   And you brought it right.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.520]   By the way, you know, I'm just curious
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.000]   if the chat room wants to make a guess.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.760]   What year that was?
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.040]   Any guesses on what year that was?
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.240]   Now don't tell me if you know, but I'm just curious,
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.280]   because I bet you they're going to guess much earlier
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   than it was.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.480]   No, they're pretty good.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.920]   Whoa.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.480]   It was 1987.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.000]   I just thought people would have thought, gosh,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.640]   that must have been a long time ago.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.600]   And in fact, it wasn't.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.120]   I really wasn't that all that long ago.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.960]   You just look like it was all that.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.080]   No, I mean by the VCR, the--
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.360]   Yes, we all look like porn stars in the late '80s.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.160]   If I had video of me, it was--
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.600]   Very much sharper.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.960]   It just-- sometimes I think--
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.000]   It feels like people plus better than you can happen.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.720]   It feels like VCRs.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.360]   And all of that seems like so long ago.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.800]   And really, 1987 was only what?
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.720]   23 years ago.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.160]   It's not that long ago.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.800]   24 years ago.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.040]   Of your generation?
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.760]   That's because I remember it.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.600]   God, I loved watching that show.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.960]   All right, so here we are, convened about two hours
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.520]   after Mark Zuckerberg made his awesome, awesome
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.320]   announcement.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.800]   It was pretty obvious when Mark said in Seattle,
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.880]   at the Seattle Facebook office, the day after Google+ came out,
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.840]   we got something awesome to announce next week
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.800]   that this was kind of something that they felt they needed
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.520]   to do in response to Google+.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.680]   Do you think, I guess?
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.400]   Well, I mean, it seems like they--
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.160]   Facebook was not in the press as much.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.760]   Google+ was getting all of our love.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.280]   Detect people.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.080]   We love that stuff.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.640]   It's like, oh, it's brand new, and it's quiet.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.520]   It's not like the same noise that's on Facebook or Twitter
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.360]   right now.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.440]   And they said, something awesome.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.000]   Something awesome.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.320]   I don't know who it's awesome for.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.800]   If you guys didn't catch the news,
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.320]   I believe it's Skype video integration into Facebook.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.160]   Well, we'll talk about it a little bit.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.800]   But I think that not only was it not awesome,
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.960]   it wasn't even, in any way, a direct response to anything
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.920]   that Google's doing, because Google talk, aim, Yahoo,
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.080]   and MSN Messenger, if all, had video messaging.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.080]   I mean, that's nothing--
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.080]   It's the point you made during the live presentation,
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.400]   or that it was just ketchup.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.800]   It's not even ketchup with Google+,
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.320]   it's ketchup with Google talk.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.480]   I think it's a big mistake to have oversold it.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.080]   It should not have said awesome.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.560]   It's a talk stop.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.840]   Gina, you agree?
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.520]   Yeah, I mean, I do agree.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.320]   It didn't feel very innovative, although--
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.680]   I mean, Hangouts got such great press.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.040]   And I think the reason why it did is because it's something cool.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.000]   It's group video chat that's not enterprise,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.880]   and anybody can use.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.000]   It's got this neat kind of design decisions around it,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.960]   around moderators and that kind of thing.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.240]   So one-to-one video chat just seems like, oh, yeah,
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.960]   every major I am service has had this for a while.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.920]   I'm saying this, though.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.920]   I haven't tried Facebook video chat yet, though.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.400]   So I mean, maybe--
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.360]   Well, we can do it right now if anybody wants to.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.760]   I'm not on it yet, though.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.320]   I'm on it.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.240]   And we tried it right after the broadcast.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.960]   Here's the thing that is true.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.960]   For the audience that Google+ has aimed at, this room,
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.000]   and everybody listening, this is like, oh, yeah, sure.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.400]   But for the audience that loves Facebook,
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.960]   I'm not convinced that this isn't something pretty important.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.320]   I don't think--
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.080]   Well, I think it's a good addition to Facebook.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.200]   No question about that.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.800]   It's just not awesome.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.760]   Well, it's so much easier than even using regular Skype.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.640]   So if you have Facebook, you would already
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.960]   know about the chat.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.000]   The chat's down here in the lower right hand corner.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.680]   You click on it.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.280]   And a lot of people will notice immediately
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.440]   there's some redesign here.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.000]   And there's even more going to come along
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.120]   with the addition of groups in here.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.600]   I don't have that yet.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.080]   And then, look, Eileen's calling me.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.480]   Well, let me just answer that call from Eileen, our producer.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.840]   She picked right up on my request.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.880]   Now, this is the beauty of it.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.120]   Doesn't feel like Skype.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.840]   There I am.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.000]   There you are, Gina.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.840]   And in a moment, we'll see Eileen.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.280]   In fact, it doesn't even really have much control in it.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.960]   There's a change of camera and audio there.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.800]   Eileen, you don't have a camera, apparently.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.300]   No.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:04.600]   You're also just in the other room.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.720]   I see myself.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.360]   Oh, you're also listening to Twit Live.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.160]   All right.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.320]   So this is a pretty lousy demonstration of how great this is.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.040]   So I know moveable or is that your Facebook experience?
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.160]   It's a normal-- now, this is on the Mac.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.680]   If you want to go full screen, it
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.680]   uses not a special full screen command as Skype does,
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.800]   but it uses the regular controls for the window.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.600]   The picture quality is excellent.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.080]   And look at no controls, no branding.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.320]   And I think this is part of what is, in fact,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.040]   innovative about this, is that it's--
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.320]   I'm going to hang up on you, Eileen.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.320]   Bye.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.840]   It works better than that.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.360]   I'll call somebody else.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.120]   What do you have to have installed to get this to work?
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.480]   Do you have to have the Skype client installed?
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.400]   No.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.800]   So what happens is you go to chat,
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.080]   and it looks exactly like this.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.920]   And you say, oh, let me chat with somebody.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.840]   And you look, and there's a little camera, start a video call.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.120]   The first time you press it, it says,
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.760]   we're going to need to install some software.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.120]   It runs a little bit of Java.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.520]   It's in Java, by the way.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.880]   Even on the PC, the PC will download a Java loader,
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.400]   an EXE loader, on the Mac.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.320]   It's just a jar file.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.960]   And it installs fairly quickly.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.200]   It's a small little bit of Java.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.040]   And then that's it.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.440]   Now it's good to go.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.520]   So I think it's actually appealing to the people it's aimed at,
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.680]   who are prime Facebook users.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.760]   In other words, your family, that's not the geek.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.280]   For them, it's going to feel pretty innovative, I think.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.280]   They're not aware of Google+, they're not on Google+.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.120]   The other thing is you don't have to find anybody else's
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.840]   contact information, what's your Skype handle?
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.960]   You just have the ability to go, here's my Facebook list,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.280]   and I'm just going to be able to do a video chat with them.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.640]   Instead of going through Skype's kind of--
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.400]   Not so great search.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.000]   I don't know if you guys ever tried that.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.640]   But when you try to find somebody with a very common name,
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.160]   it's very difficult to find them.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.320]   And if you go through Facebook and you have all these ways
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.240]   to actually confirm who they are, it's a lot simpler.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.920]   So it may not be awesome.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.560]   And it's certainly--
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.040]   Well, it's awesome to a community, to a community.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.640]   I mean, I think now I see--
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.080]   when I think about my in-laws on both sides of my family,
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.600]   just absolutely live on Facebook.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.680]   And if I said, getting a Skype call arranged to see the kids
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.280]   is a little bit of a nightmare.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.760]   You know, install this, OK?
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.600]   Sign up for an account.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.880]   What's your Skype name?
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.280]   This is just going to be instant.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.520]   So I think awesome is relative.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.200]   Inside the Facebook community, this is a big deal.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.240]   And I think it's great.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.680]   I think they did make a mistake in adding--
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.320]   they now have three things-- the group chats, which
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.120]   is even more ho-hum.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.960]   These are things any chat client has had all along--
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.080]   group chats, video chat-- what was the third thing?
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.320]   Just design.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.800]   Yeah, redesign so that you could see the group chats.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.720]   They probably should have left the group chats off.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.200]   Just done the Skype thing.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.800]   They did have Tony Coates, who is the new CEO of Skype,
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.160]   come on stage.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.280]   I think the thing that's most interesting to me,
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.760]   as it-- as it--
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.920]   somebody covering tech is the fact that Skype is about to be
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.640]   owned by Microsoft.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.120]   And this puts Facebook squarely in the Microsoft corner.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.600]   If Microsoft is a minority shareholder,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.000]   Bing and his integrates-- already integrates
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.440]   Facebook.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.360]   And now, Microsoft product Skype is going to be powering video
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.040]   chat and Facebook.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.200]   It is an interesting--
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.280]   why do you think that Facebook is so willing to get in bed
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.040]   with Microsoft of all people?
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.160]   Microsoft can scale.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.760]   I think they've been able to handle all this kind of web
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.680]   stuff before.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.160]   And they have decent management, even though a lot of people
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.160]   call for bombers, resignation every two minutes.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.800]   So I mean, you have a very young company like Facebook
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.240]   that might not know the ropes.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.640]   It might make sense to partner with somebody as large
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.920]   as Microsoft who could help them and show them, OK, look,
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.240]   this is the way this could go.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.240]   And we have a lot of money.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.200]   We know what we're doing.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.640]   So maybe you want to listen to us.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.240]   Well, it's a good thing for Skype,
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:04.040]   because Skype gains 750 million potential new customers.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.400]   They mentioned that although there's
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.480]   no financial relationship between Facebook and Skype,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.720]   at least that's the implication.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.960]   I'm not convinced that's the case,
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.360]   but that's kind of what Mark said without saying it.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.920]   Skype is going to have the ability to upsell Facebook
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.640]   users to premium Skype services.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.960]   It's not clear how that's going to happen.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.560]   But that's huge for Skype.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.800]   The ability to scale, say, things like Skype out or free
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.280]   calling, that kind of thing is huge for Skype.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.280]   So I think it's a big one for Microsoft,
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.280]   a big one for Skype.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.880]   It's a good thing that something that--
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.040]   as soon as I heard about the Skype deal with Microsoft,
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.280]   I thought, oh, this is going to happen.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.960]   And obviously, this was something in the works.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.440]   And this is nothing you could have pulled out of your butt
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.920]   in five days.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.680]   No, not at all.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.440]   Do you think they rushed the announcement?
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.240]   Or is this something they kind of planned to do anyway?
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.760]   I think there are lots of people in the community
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.560]   in Silicon Valley who talk and know what the other guy is doing.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.080]   And I think this is all happening the same time.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.040]   And I think Google just pulled a trigger sooner,
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.320]   and it was close.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.080]   They knew.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.800]   This isn't the first time that Facebook is having
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.360]   a sort of partnership with Microsoft.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.640]   It didn't Facebook partner with them with docs.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.760]   The docs.com long.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.240]   Oh, that's right.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.320]   I forgot docs.com.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:09.880]   That's another one.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.840]   That one too.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.120]   And there's advertising.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.560]   Isn't there Facebook--
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.560]   Facebook's in Bing.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.400]   If you go to Bing, you'll get Facebook search results.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.840]   And they're the social search.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.360]   Yes.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.440]   I mean, it makes sense that Facebook--
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.320]   I mean, Facebook, Microsoft partnerships,
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.640]   I think make a lot of sense, especially if Facebook
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.800]   feels threatened by Google.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.640]   I mean--
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.240]   Is it the axis of not do evil?
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.640]   It's the axis.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.040]   And it's my enemy is my friend.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.440]   That's what it really is, isn't it?
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.200]   Because Facebook's clearly terrified of Google.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.360]   Microsoft's terrified of Google.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.960]   So they should join forces and fight Google.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.480]   Yes.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.960]   Yeah, I think that there were two interesting things to me.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.920]   And this.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.040]   The first was that Suckerm worker,
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.360]   I think, was trying to position himself as saying,
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.720]   we have the social graph.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.840]   You don't, nanny, nanny, nanny.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.200]   And we can do just all kinds of things on top of this.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.520]   And others can try to catch up to get the social stuff,
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.600]   but they don't have it.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.440]   We do.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.400]   The second thing that's interesting
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.480]   is that he gave a real shout out to developers
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.560]   and said we're far better off developing
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.120]   with outsiders than our own, unlike some other companies.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.680]   Wink, wink, wink, which I think includes most certainly Twitter.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.640]   And in part, Google as well.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.400]   We don't have an API yet for--
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.760]   Proplos we'll see where that goes.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.640]   Yeah, but it's pretty obvious we will for--
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.280]   Yeah, I think we will.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.520]   And pretty obvious we won't for anything Facebook does, right?
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.000]   I know that's-- but yes, but we have a platform
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   and you can build Zinga on top of Facebook
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.280]   and you can build it on top of the social graph that they have.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.800]   It's a platform, not an API.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.720]   I guess that's--
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.320]   OK, fine.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.240]   That's an extension.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:44.800]   Sorry, yes.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.360]   I'm so sorry.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.920]   Is that a fair distinction to make GINA platform?
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.520]   Yes.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.880]   A platform just not an API, I'm not a vice versa.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.840]   Right, right.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.160]   I mean, the distinction is you log in to Facebook
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.360]   to use Facebook apps.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.240]   That's not necessary.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.240]   Yeah, but you do-- no, that's the point.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.240]   If it's a platform, you're within the platform.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.560]   If it's an API, you can stand out here and say, give us
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.720]   some stuff and I'll integrate it in.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.880]   So that's a big difference.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.920]   It is a big difference.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.520]   I'm going to smoke.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.440]   But I still think that's where he's trying to position himself.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:12.840]   Is there--
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.520]   And I have to say, when Mark implies
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   we have the social graph and Google doesn't,
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.760]   I'm not sure I buy into that.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.480]   I mean, I think Google has a pretty darn--
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.520]   they've got a 1 billion user base.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.040]   Absolutely.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.560]   Well, I've been trying to think about this.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.760]   There is a one winner to get the social graph.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.720]   I mean, yes, Facebook is absolutely dominating.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.840]   And yes, Facebook has been thinking about the problems
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.400]   around social for a lot longer than Google has seriously.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.320]   But what does Gmail have?
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.680]   200 million users, and that doesn't come close to this,
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.760]   750 million.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.720]   But it's not--
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.240]   It's enough.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.320]   --the long winner takes all.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.000]   It just isn't.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.800]   I mean, if you look at the enthusiasm around Google Plus
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.120]   within our community-- and I say within our community,
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.840]   because it is very much just our community right now--
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.760]   there's room for lots of different networks, I think.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.600]   I tried to write this up, and I accidentally erased Google
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.120]   Plus post, which is as well, because I hadn't thought it through.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.160]   Do not write in Google Plus, OK?
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:04.720]   That's OK.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:04.920]   It's OK.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.360]   It's my fault, it's stupidity.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.760]   But here's what I'm noodling about, is identity.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.200]   I said on a post last week after our show that I thought
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.080]   that Facebook was about relationships,
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.400]   Twitter was about broadcasting, Tumblr was about quoting,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.200]   and Google Plus is about sharing.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.720]   Now, that's absolutely wrong, because each one is
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.560]   about all those things.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.720]   But in terms of emphasis, that's where I started.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.160]   And then I thought about it more.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.320]   And I think there's something about identity going on here.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.800]   That Facebook, on the one hand, has the best position of all
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.480]   when it comes to identity, because they do
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.560]   have real relationships, more real identity.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.320]   It's harder to come up with a fake identity there.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.680]   The bloodstream tends to reject it more.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.880]   And so that, in that sense, I think
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.800]   would put Facebook ahead.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.320]   The irony for Facebook, because we've discussed in the show
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.280]   long ago, is the problem of a public and the public,
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.400]   is that I don't necessarily want to use my Facebook-established
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.440]   identity in the whole world, which is where it could be most
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.720]   valuable.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.760]   And Google comes along now and says, well, no, we've got a
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.600]   new identity.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.560]   When I can still make up, I can become Eliot's
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.640]   Pitzer in a minute.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.040]   I can do whatever I want on Google Plus.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.480]   Eliot's Pitzer now.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.160]   But yeah, I think that there is--
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.920]   while it's not as strong as Facebook, there's a pretty good
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.360]   link between identity and reality on Facebook.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.640]   I mean, on Google Plus, isn't there?
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.280]   Yeah, and I think it'll get even better, which goes to
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.840]   your old point, Leo, which is the more that Google ties your
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.520]   profile page to search, or you have invested in it, the more
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.000]   it becomes, as you put it, the canonical version of you.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.760]   And they've just added this other thing, which we've
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.440]   mentioned in a paragraph--
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.240]   I mean, in a parenthesis last week, that they've now
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.840]   starting to promote authors.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.560]   So I'm part of the beta of that.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.520]   Who wants that?
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.560]   It's really cool.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.000]   If you Google a blog post that I've written or Jeff's written
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.640]   in search results, you'll see our Google profile picture as
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.320]   the author next to the search result.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.560]   Oh, yeah, we have that too.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.920]   In fact, you have to do a rel link in there.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.400]   I'm going to turn that on as well.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.680]   It's very simple.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.760]   They sent me the information.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.880]   Google sent me the information on that.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.280]   Does Google actually go ahead and try to find your
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.160]   verified sites and then pull that content?
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   Because I know when I was writing on blogs, I would see
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.560]   my content posted on other sites that I did not authorize.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.720]   Is Google actually filtering all that stuff out?
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:20.960]   Or is your--
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.720]   You're trying to go to the sites that put in the rel
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.040]   author on top.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:28.240]   Yeah, you put the rel equals author attribute on the link
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.280]   to your canonical page.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.520]   And then on your Google profile, you say, this site is by me
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.200]   and this site is about me.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.160]   And so you tell Google these sites, I own these sites
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.160]   and these sites are about me.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.280]   So it knows those sites.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.880]   So your image actually wouldn't show up on a site that's
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880]   just sucked your content.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.480]   Oh, that sounds beautiful.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.400]   There's a blog post here at Yoast.com.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.160]   Yostvan Devalka wrote this and explains exactly how to do
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:55.760]   it.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.720]   In fact, Google sent me to this blog post to do it.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.240]   So it says, how to add rel-author and so forth.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.040]   This is for WordPress specifically.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.080]   But if you know what you're doing, you can easily
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.200]   extrapolate this to any site.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.600]   And now Google is also making all profiles public as of the
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.120]   end of the month, as of July 31st.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.520]   So if your profile is private, they'll just shut it down.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.040]   What's the product?
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:20.240]   What's the product?
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.720]   Private profile anyway.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.160]   Well, right.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.760]   I mean, that's a good question.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.000]   And that's what they've kind of come to.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.880]   Is it the purpose of the profile is for you to publicly
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.800]   identify yourself.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   So if you don't want to publicly identify yourself, then
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.520]   don't have a profile, which is pretty strong language.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.960]   I thought it was really interesting.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.360]   Google did a lot of tweaking over the weekend to privacy
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.640]   controls in the stream on Google+, which giving people
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.320]   the ability to create these private spaces.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.920]   But then they also sort of came out with this announcement
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.280]   that Google profiles are just going to be public and that's it.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.760]   So it's a really interesting stuff going on on both sides.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.560]   Absolutely.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.240]   You wrote a great post about that, Gina.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.640]   You wrote a great post about that.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.400]   You and I disagree in very minute shades of gray here.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.840]   But I think that people are trying to figure this out
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.040]   in new ways.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.000]   I think you're--
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.480]   I'll make your point for you, but your point that there are now
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.040]   better controls that you can say to someone, this is what
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.120]   I'm sharing with this group.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.880]   And then if I try to share it in turn, I'm prevented--
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.640]   well, I've reminded that each of the groups I'm prevented
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.440]   from sharing it publicly.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.320]   And I'm fine with that and I get that.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.040]   My fear about that is what I've seen happen many times already
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.600]   is people are just kind of defaulting to a group.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.240]   And then I can share it less.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.800]   And there's no good reason.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.720]   Vic Contreaux, himself, shared a video of him in a Mercedes
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.880]   ad about how the car saved him from an accident.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.280]   It was a public video.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.040]   He sent it to one group.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.760]   I then couldn't share it with the world who can see the video.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.040]   But that's because he particularly
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.280]   chose a setting that says it's not shareable or--
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.720]   No, he chose to send it to a limited group.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.080]   Because of the limited group that he sent it to.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.720]   And then I couldn't share it with the whole public.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.680]   No, that's interesting.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.920]   So what's happening is people are just sharing it
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.120]   with one group and now it's shutting me down from being
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.040]   able to share more broadly the way I can--
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.040]   I thought that was a setting.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.120]   So that's not a setting.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.720]   That's by default.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.240]   I can be wrong.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.040]   Do you know what do you--
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.880]   Yeah, so it used to be like--
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.240]   when at first launch, if you shared with a circle,
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.800]   someone in that circle, because that could then
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.240]   reshare publicly.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.320]   Re-share publicly, right.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.880]   So they've disabled that now.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.120]   So if I shared with a circle, someone in my circle
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.480]   can share to other circles with a little warning
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.560]   to be thoughtful, because the original author shared--
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.440]   I like that warning.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.360]   Yeah, I thought that was good.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.000]   Yeah, the warning is very cool with.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.360]   And that made sense.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.480]   And this is what I've been pushing for after--
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.560]   I talked about this last week after seeing Tim O'Reilly talk
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.120]   about it.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.600]   Let's use more A's.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.240]   Let's use social pressure.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.240]   Let's use peer pressure.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   Let's not use settings to do this.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.560]   So remind people that, oh, you may not
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.720]   want to share this publicly, because it wasn't originally
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.120]   shared publicly, but not stop them from doing it.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.880]   And I really like Jeff's point, which is that in real life,
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.480]   if you tell someone something, they can share it publicly
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.120]   on their own.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.040]   And you have no control.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.960]   You might not even know.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.520]   And so Jeff, I think your argument
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.960]   was saying, why would we disable this ability
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.040]   to share publicly in software if this is something that
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.120]   can happen in real life?
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.800]   Why don't we just create the social--
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.320]   the context in which people are more thoughtful?
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.120]   You can't legislate secrets.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:13.620]   Right.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.640]   You can't-- but at the same time,
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.160]   when you think about any good Twitter client,
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.880]   it doesn't let your retweet a direct message.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.380]   Right.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.600]   Well, that's probably why Representative Wiener--
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.840]   Yeah, but you can always get around that stuff.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.160]   If somebody's a real jerk, and they
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.120]   want to be able to access your DM and repost it,
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.280]   or they want to share something--
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.000]   A paste.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.400]   You can just do a screenshot.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:29.920]   In chat.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.480]   Put that up.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.280]   So I mean, that's what we--
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.360]   I think the key here is to me is that we're putting--
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.680]   and you were headed toward this, Leo--
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.240]   we're putting too much on the technology, which also means
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.600]   we know what's going to happen here.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.240]   Somehow, somebody shared that they didn't want shared,
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.120]   gets shared, beyond where they fought,
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.640]   and who are they going to blame?
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.240]   The technology, not the person.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.200]   Yes.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.040]   And so I think that Google is setting this up in a way
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.360]   that it's trying to give a false sense of security
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.920]   that the technology will solve this.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.720]   Well, in the defense, they have no choice.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.040]   After the Buzz fiasco and the FTC oversight
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.040]   that they now are subject to, they don't have a choice.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.560]   They have to do this.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.880]   But it's unfortunate that this is culturally the way we're
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.400]   responding.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.000]   I think so, and I think that the two things that happen--
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.240]   one is that I think on Facebook--
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.680]   and I think I said this last week--
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.120]   on Facebook now, it's gotten to the point
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.160]   where if someone asked to be my friend,
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.560]   my accounts broke, and so I actually can't, folks, but fine.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.880]   And if I want to go then see them and see who they are,
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.360]   well, they've locked down always.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.960]   They've locked down their accounts so much I have no idea
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.760]   who they are.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.640]   Some friend you are.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.080]   And so this overreaction has turned a sharing service
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.880]   into a privacy service, which is insane.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.840]   What I do love is the reminders.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.240]   You're right.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.480]   That's about more A's.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.440]   That's about norms.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.840]   That says, I'm going to inform you.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.080]   This is how Gina shared this.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.680]   If you want to screw Gina, if you think
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.040]   you've got a good reason to, that's up to you and Gina.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.560]   Right.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.440]   And it's between you and Gina.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.240]   Between you and Gina.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.160]   But I can understand why Google feels--
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.960]   they have to-- now somebody in the chat room saying,
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.440]   well, wait a minute, didn't you guys
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.800]   invade against Facebook for having places check-ins be public?
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.280]   But that's very different.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.720]   Telling-- although maybe not.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.120]   I don't know, what would you say, Jeff?
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.720]   Is that different to say, I know where I as is,
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.560]   and I'm going to check him in here publicly?
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.840]   I think that is, because granted, I could do that anyway.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.800]   I could just type, hey, I see I am.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.960]   Absolutely.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.760]   Right.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.080]   But to systematize that kind of sharing,
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.160]   I think was a problem for Facebook.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.600]   But what I think they-- what they all need to do
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.480]   is just to make sure you have informed action.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.720]   It's funny, because we are now a little bit in Zuck's corner,
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.520]   who has said all along, it's good for you.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.080]   Let it all hang out.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.160]   Sharing is good.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.400]   And maybe he wasn't so far off.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.240]   I don't know.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.320]   Yeah, I think so too.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.280]   Well, the other thing is that Zuck contends
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.520]   that we have one identity.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.880]   And I agree with him on this, that though there are shades,
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.000]   when we get in trouble, if we think the technology can keep
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.840]   and prevent our beer picture from being seen
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.080]   by the wrong person, well, the problem with that
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.080]   is we're putting too much reliance on the technology.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.640]   A, B, the other problem is the person who disapproves
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.520]   of me drinking a beer, they got problems.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.160]   We've got to deal with that.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.880]   So what I think is Google is doing here
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.360]   is putting this false expectation that you can
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.960]   silo your whole life.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.440]   You can't.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.840]   Actually, that was Mark Zuckerberg's roundabout response
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.400]   to Ben Parr of Mashable.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.280]   And Ben said, well, what do you think of Google+,
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.800]   he first said a lot of companies are going
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.120]   to do something like this, but Facebook has the social graph.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.400]   This was that social graph argument.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.600]   And we don't have to worry about competitors.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.360]   We just have to keep innovating.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.600]   But he then, I don't know if it was in response to this question,
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.360]   but he did talk a lot about that whole issue of Facebook
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.120]   groups versus Google circles and the non-granular sharing
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.440]   that's on Facebook compared to the inherently granular share.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.680]   Do you guys use Facebook groups?
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.560]   I've set them up.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.440]   You see, he pointed out that 50% of everybody's actively
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.400]   using Facebook groups.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.240]   I don't know what that means.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.160]   I set up groups, and I haven't used them since.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.800]   I just want all Jeanna to use them.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.480]   I don't.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.240]   But I really don't.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.280]   I just don't use Facebook that much at all.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.680]   I really just do it to check in with my extended family who
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.320]   uses it.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.760]   I just never found my community there, honestly.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.520]   Right.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.800]   I cut you off as is my habit, Jeanna.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.280]   Do you feel that Google's in the right spot now
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.440]   with their current settings on sharing?
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.280]   I do.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.080]   I think they're in a really good space right now with a stream.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.120]   I think that that was the right decision
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.760]   to make the disabling sharing to public.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.880]   Although now you've convinced me that if you added public
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.160]   to the list of places to share a limited post with,
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.760]   that it would just pop up another reminder and say,
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.600]   are you sure that you want to do this?
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.240]   Because you can forward an email to anyone you want.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.680]   So there's arguments to be made.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.040]   You can't retweet DMs.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.800]   You can't forward email anywhere.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.360]   Or you can just talk to someone on the street.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.200]   Like you said.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.240]   Here's another way to post the question.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.640]   Do you think that Google+ is essentially
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.440]   a sharing service or a communication service?
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.960]   Oh, that's-- I'm still figuring that out.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.400]   I think it's--
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.400]   What's the distinction?
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:20.900]   Staying.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:21.400]   That's interesting.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.200]   I think that a sharing service means
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.880]   that you expect to share with people
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.080]   and how many and in what circumstances
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.920]   are things you have to work out and their system
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.440]   is to help you that.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.400]   Whereas a communication service is email.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:31.920]   I think it's both.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.920]   I think it's both.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.360]   It says--
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:33.840]   I think it's both.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.320]   Because I've used it both ways.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.840]   By the way, with very little response,
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.200]   but I have used it to direct--
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.360]   in effect direct message to set up a one to one
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.040]   which you can do just by saying, OK, I as I'm going to add you
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.400]   to this and I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.960]   And I've done that a couple of times.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.800]   And in every case, I did one of Veronica Belmont, which I then
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.960]   cut and pasted into an email because I never heard from her.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.160]   And I did one, I think, to our team,
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.680]   to the Twit Company circle and got one or two responses
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.360]   but did not stimulate conversation.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.320]   The problem with Google+ is that you have--
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.720]   it's almost like an unfiltered feed.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.520]   Even though you have all these circles,
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.600]   that message you sent out--
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.840]   There's no separate channel for it.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.240]   It got lost unless you make a specific circle
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.040]   for your business.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.720]   So the answer is it's a sharing service.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.440]   It has communication features, but you're right.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.200]   It's a sharing service.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.440]   And that's why they have email built in.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.440]   So you can always go there for that direct thing.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.480]   And that's the thing with Google that I've
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.080]   noticed for the longest time.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.600]   Tons of disparate pieces that have never been put together.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.520]   And Gmail is with this added bar on the top.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.880]   It says, look, this is the one place for you to go.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.040]   When you want to share, go to plus.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.280]   When you want to talk to somebody directly, we have Gmail.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.920]   Even though that chat's in Gmail and it's in plus--
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.480]   so there's some elements that are crossover.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.280]   But I think Google+ is very different than using something
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.280]   like an email service.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.480]   I mean, Facebook tried to do email.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.600]   And that doesn't really work.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.560]   They have messages.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.760]   But they have their own email address, too,
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.360]   that nobody seems to use.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.160]   I think it's a really important point
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.920]   that you make that there's no guarantee the person you're
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.200]   sending to is going to look at just that fee.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.880]   Whereas if you DM me or if you email me--
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.760]   It's in a separate place.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.640]   Not see it, but the expectation is very different.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.440]   I think it's a really important point.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.560]   But there's an argument that Hangouts is definitely
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.000]   about communication or just about more about shared
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.440]   experience than communication.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.560]   And I think Google+ can be used just for communication.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.760]   I did a post that was, I think, to all my circles,
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.000]   which I'm following quite a few people,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   hundreds of people, and said, huddles is totally broke.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.240]   It's all broken for me.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.040]   Bunch of strangers starting huddles of me,
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.080]   blowing up my phone.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.880]   I don't know who's who or what's what.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.160]   And then privately-- and the Google team
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.840]   has been doing a great job of this--
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.440]   privately, a Google team member sent a message with just
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.360]   shared just with me and Leo, actually.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.600]   And I noticed-- I think I don't know Leo if you responded.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.680]   I didn't see your response.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.520]   Did you respond?
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.040]   I did.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.680]   It took me 12 hours, but I finally responded.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.880]   Yeah, you said, can you tell me more
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.000]   about your experience with huddle?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.640]   Like, how can we make it better?
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.960]   And it's interesting, because I kept
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.160]   trying to find that message again.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.320]   Like, oh, did Leo get back?
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.840]   Did they get their conversation, too?
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.360]   But it was hard to find.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.120]   I mean, it's so hard to find stuff.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.320]   It's amazing.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.160]   There's no good post search.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.160]   I was like, I want to see things that I've commented on.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.240]   And anyway, it's early still.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.680]   So what was amazing when you did that original post,
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.080]   I guess, one of those posts, and you asked for help,
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.280]   Vic came in, and the time stamp is there in two minutes.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.760]   Yes, instead we're working on it.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.360]   Don't count on that staying that way.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.120]   I mean, come on.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   Well, right.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.400]   But we said, we're working on it,
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.280]   and then he called out the Google developer saying, hey,
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.000]   and then the Google developer who was working on it,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.720]   presumably, came and said, oh, yes, we're working on that.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.720]   We have a change coming soon.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.280]   So the customer service has been great.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.360]   Although I did pose a question to everybody
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.000]   in my Google company circle, asking them
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.600]   about the percentage of women field testing the service,
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.560]   and I got crickets.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.840]   So there isn't an instant response on everything.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.560]   So it's like a geek conference, yeah.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.000]   I found the--
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.960]   I'll see if I can find it.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.480]   I found the-- my response to the question,
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.000]   but I can't find the original question.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.440]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.800]   I know why this is, because I responded in a separate post.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.440]   Is there actually a search feature built into this?
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:00.440]   No.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.360]   I'll sort of look around.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.560]   I'm like, wait, there isn't a search.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.080]   OK, that's not quite true, because you can use generalized
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.440]   Google search if you do site colon plus dot Google dot com.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.360]   And then the search.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.280]   But that's a little hard to do.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.360]   OK, that's a little hard.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.160]   I mean, Google--
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.360]   So let's start a list of the things that we want here.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.800]   Search is number one.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.040]   Number two is Google.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.920]   They might be good at that.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.680]   Search and hashtags, which is a specialized form
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.280]   of search, where you click the hashtag,
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.240]   and that does a search for that term.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.200]   I also want going to what Gina just said.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.000]   I want-- why didn't they put the star in here?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.320]   The star is all over Google.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.160]   Oh, favorite.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.320]   Why can't I favor--
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.520]   Well, plus one.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.000]   Plus one is kind of-- but plus one
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.600]   doesn't apparently do anything.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   Well, and I can't go--
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   Because they can't go find your plus one.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   Well, it's me approving stars, me saving.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.100]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.200]   I have no way to save stuff.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.600]   But plus one doesn't do the same thing
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.480]   as a plus one on the open web does.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:46.800]   No.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.240]   It's true.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:47.760]   You're right.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.640]   It doesn't really do much, except do a nice little graphic.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   Counter it.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.320]   It's just an attaboy and attaboy and attabryl
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:53.920]   to the original--
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.420]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:54.920]   That's exactly--
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.800]   I imagine that they're going to start to serve this--
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   I think we should not-- I really
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.120]   think we should be careful about.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.560]   And I see a lot of this criticizing Google Plus
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:07.240]   at this point, since it's obviously so early on.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.920]   I mean, it's appropriate to say what do we want.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.680]   I think that's fine.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.840]   I think they're obviously very actively collecting
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.800]   that kind of information.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.440]   So I'm not saying don't do that.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.600]   But I don't think you can judge-- and it's not even public.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.000]   You cannot judge Google Plus based on what we're seeing today.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.800]   Some of these bloggers who are coming together,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.480]   and I'll leave them unnamed.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.800]   But a few of them come in, and the first thing that is going
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.240]   to deep end--
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.200]   No, I'm in, and you're not.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.080]   It's a big deal.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.200]   And then within two days--
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.120]   Oh, I hate it.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.760]   I rejected all.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.760]   I hate that.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.520]   I can't--
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.120]   You killed Danny.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.000]   It's just as bad.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.120]   It's just as bad as me saying that Wave was going
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.360]   to change the world.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.520]   I'll grab that.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.000]   But it's too soon.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:41.520]   It's too soon.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.760]   And we've now learned this lesson,
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.920]   because I did the same thing with Buzz.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.600]   So we've learned this lesson that you cannot jump on this bandwagon
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.120]   too quickly.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.920]   You got to wait and see if it plays out.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.600]   But I do note one thing, and I think it's impossible not
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:57.120]   to note this, that there is something about Google Plus
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.240]   to the people who are using it, that it is making it
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.840]   incredibly sticky.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.360]   Yes.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.960]   They're using it and all complaining about it, long hours.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.720]   The engagement is very high.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.600]   I mean, many people have already got more people in their circles
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.880]   than they have on Buzz, or even our Facebook, or anywhere else.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.360]   I mean, the engagement's very high.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.840]   So there is something-- there is some nugget there.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.800]   Oh, there really is.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.280]   It's funny.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.200]   I think this is where Google was hoist on its own,
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.160]   but hard.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.680]   I have people in one of the companies
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.360]   I deal with where they're all complaining.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.440]   And oh, it's too much work to get in.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.920]   Or I don't have any friends there,
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.160]   so I don't see what it's about or any right.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.320]   So you think, oh, well, how would you solve that?
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.360]   Oh, well, gee, let's go to your Gmail
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.480]   and give you some instant friends.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.600]   It'd be the wrong thing to do.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.920]   But that's the problem.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.480]   There is a-- we, the geeks, went to the effort
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.360]   to make enough friends to make it work for us,
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.960]   and then it became more addictive.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.040]   If you're not like that, you come to it,
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.440]   and it's crickets.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:04.960]   I almost don't want to say this, but I think that I
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.920]   like it the way it is, and please don't invite anybody else,
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.440]   or let anybody else in.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.520]   You like it closed off?
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.920]   And I think that as soon as you open this up to the world
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:19.280]   at large, it will be no better than anything else.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.880]   I think one of the reasons-- I hate to say this.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.680]   One of the reasons it's so engaging
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.240]   is because it's us talking to each other.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   Well, that's why I went in.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.720]   That's the Scobble position, right?
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.080]   Yeah, this signal to know is no issue.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:31.580]   Good.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.160]   Blame Scobble.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:32.800]   Scobble said that.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.920]   Scobble is speaking out of both sides of his mouth.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.360]   Scobble is the first person to say,
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.160]   I have a thousand people, and then he says,
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.160]   I have too many people.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:39.720]   Yeah, I know.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.360]   He always bucks me when he does that.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.680]   He follows everybody, then complains about the noise.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.440]   He's like, oh, Robert, come on.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.720]   You're just shooting yourself in the foot.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.400]   So Gina, how many followers do you have now?
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.400]   Oh, stop it.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.560]   Gina's the highest ranked woman on Google+,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.160]   at number 13, which is--
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.520]   And only 10% of women on Google+,
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.440]   only 10% of women of Google+ users are female.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.000]   Well, according to socialstatistics.com,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   which apparently you have to put your Google+ ID into
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.600]   to have some cracker stats.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.800]   So I can't tell if it's that more men are interested
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.640]   in their ranking, or truly, there are only 10% of women.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.240]   We, I have to say, like to measure.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.680]   Well, yeah, like to measure.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.880]   We do know this.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.000]   So I don't know what the answer is.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.640]   And actually, that's what I keep asking Google about.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.480]   And they are not sharing numbers about their user base.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.720]   And I'm sure that's because we've
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.200]   criticized them on this show about not having real world
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.000]   users actually trying.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.800]   And I made this point on Google+, so apologies.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.000]   Those of you who are following me.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.840]   But it's like the best people to tell you
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.400]   whether or not your privacy controls are good,
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.920]   are victims of harassment, stalking, rape.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.920]   And those people are mostly women, not entirely,
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.720]   but mostly women.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.200]   And women use social software actually a lot more than men.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:55.840]   I think--
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.000]   Well, on Facebook, for sure.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:57.800]   It's really important.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.320]   On Facebook, for sure, right?
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.640]   So I just think it's really important to have lots of women
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.680]   testers and people of color.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.400]   And I mean, you know--
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.960]   Did you think that there's a fault of Google
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.320]   that they didn't invite enough women?
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.760]   I tend to not think that because I think actually Google is
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.120]   in terms of on the scale of social value tech companies
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.480]   are actually pretty good.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.600]   But then also, they only see to the number.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.320]   And then many of the other people on here
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.680]   were invited by others, right?
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.600]   Right, of course.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.200]   You could have gone to blog her and glam, for example.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.440]   And gotten 3, 4,000 very active social--
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.640]   Maybe they should have.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.280]   I actually think that they should have done that.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.080]   Yes.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.160]   I absolutely agree with you, Janie.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:36.600]   It's absolutely right.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.840]   And I've found out the same thing that I look at my list.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.880]   And the testosterone is stifling.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.080]   It's a high-level testosterone, for sure.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.080]   Yes.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.320]   On the other hand, one thing I'm very glad about--
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.880]   maybe it's just my weirdness because I do the German stuff.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.400]   But I'm finding it to be incredibly international for me.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.360]   Oh, I love it, too.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.400]   In fact, if I look at incoming--
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   which, by the way, I really like incoming.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.160]   I like that, too.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.560]   I guess that's the equivalent of the Twitter everything
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.360]   from page.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.080]   Well, I think that's a little bit differently.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.360]   I think incoming is the people who
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.080]   are interested in you who you're not necessarily listening to,
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:10.600]   right?
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.200]   So there is no analog to that.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:12.880]   No, there isn't.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.040]   And what's great about it is that when I go incoming,
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.440]   I find it really, really interesting.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.560]   But, of course, noisier.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.880]   This is people there who are speaking languages I don't know.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.240]   They're interested in things I don't know.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.520]   They're interested in what I have to say.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.640]   That we have a communication.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.160]   I find new people there.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:34.080]   I can read them, but I don't have to noise up my own street.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.000]   It's amazing when you get up early in the morning.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   It's not now so much.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.640]   But when you get up early in the morning,
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.320]   more than 3/4 of this, for me, is Chinese.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.600]   You know what's weird about this?
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.720]   I mean, they have an eight-word question.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.720]   They have an eight-word question.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   For translate.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.480]   You think they could talk to themselves and say, hey,
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.880]   what language would you like to notice your incoming
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.440]   streaming?
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.080]   So this is another bug that should be fixed.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.880]   That seems like a pretty simple thing Google could do.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.080]   Add an interesting button.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.000]   I would like to see that because I'm looking through my incoming
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.360]   right now.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.040]   I see some Spanish and I speak a little Spanish.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:02.520]   That helps.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.640]   But you're right.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.200]   In the morning, it's the other side of the world.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:05.920]   I love it, though.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.080]   I think that that's just really cool.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.680]   And it does show that this has reached well beyond the US
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.160]   and the Technerati that normally
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.880]   are part of these kinds of tests.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.520]   Well, that's where they did get a diversity,
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.320]   which goes to Gina's point.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.760]   They did see that-- I think it was Vic who
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.920]   said on our show last week that they tried to get heavy up
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.680]   in 2023 languages, I remember.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.080]   And so they did see it in other countries.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.320]   They should have seeded it across other genders.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.320]   Other genders.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.120]   Other genders.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.640]   Well, there's male, female, and other.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.400]   There are other genders.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.240]   I have three children, a boy and a girl.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.720]   And the other one.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.080]   I've barely looked at incoming because my existing--
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.720]   the people that I do follow are so prolific
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.000]   that I can barely keep up with that.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.840]   I mean, it is-- it's very active.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.320]   There's a lot to see.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.440]   One of the people I follow is a local politician.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.960]   I'm not going to give too much information to female, who
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.200]   just recently complained to me in a limited post.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.560]   I hope I'm not breaching confidence.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.680]   I didn't say her name.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.280]   But that she was getting a lot of pictures of genitalia
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.000]   tagged with her name.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.160]   So there is some bad stuff going on.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.360]   Oh, crap already.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.920]   But that could happen on any surface.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.680]   Yeah, but no.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.320]   But I think that this is to Gina's point,
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.920]   that if you want to test your systems
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.960]   and how effective and they are and how good the privacy is,
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.400]   this you put more women on there and you'll see right away
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.840]   what's going on, unfortunately.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.800]   I don't think we see that on Facebook.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.880]   Do you think?
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.520]   Well, I mean, I'm just thinking, right now,
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.200]   you get a notification that says, do you approve this tagging?
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.800]   And I know that you have the approval option.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.840]   But you're allowed to tags-- this is the problem.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.800]   And this is feedback that--
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.080]   I do want to send to Google and I will as soon as I get off
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:49.800]   the air.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:54.040]   They need to-- right now, anybody, even if not in your circles,
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.440]   can tag you.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.920]   So you should be able to say, I only want--
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.120]   not only I want to approve tags, but I only
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.840]   want people to be able to tag me in my circles.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.880]   There needs to be more granular.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.680]   Yeah, that seems like it's just another step.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.120]   They could do that.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.440]   If Facebook, they allowed you to do that.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.480]   You can say, only my friends can tag you.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:09.840]   So--
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.520]   Facebook's got machine tagging now.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.960]   So I don't know.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.440]   I don't think-- that's another interesting thing.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.840]   Although Google has the capability,
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:21.280]   I don't think they're doing automated tagging.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.320]   Hopefully they're auto-detecting genitalia.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.720]   It would be bad if your nose looked like a penis, though.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.760]   And they were turning on the--
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.560]   You got to be black, far.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.000]   These take my nose more like a penis than my penis does.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.440]   I'm so sorry.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.000]   Every time.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.640]   It always dissolves to that.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.960]   You know, I'm sorry you have to work with this genide.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.680]   It cracks me up, actually.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.920]   I love you guys.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.960]   We love you guys.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.680]   We love you, too.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.240]   Don't nobody else do that.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:55.840]   Keep it clean.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.320]   Just me.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.240]   I'm allowed.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.680]   He's in that private circle.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.520]   It's OK.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.600]   Well, and that's a good point.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.040]   I mean, that's another thing that happens in social networks.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.440]   Stuff is tolerated.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.280]   Your friends, who you know, you tolerate things like that.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.720]   Yeah, I've been thinking about creating a circle
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.880]   for people who don't misinterpret my bad jokes.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.360]   Right.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:13.840]   That one.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.200]   Because otherwise, if I put it on Twitter,
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.800]   it's just a nightmare.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.080]   Oh, you're right.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:18.600]   You're right.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.800]   The irony circle.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.760]   The irony circle.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.440]   As opposed to the literal net circle.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:23.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.840]   That looks like a whole other thing.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.160]   We need circles within circles.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.600]   We need-- the Venn diagrams aren't complicated enough.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.000]   Venn diagrams, super circles.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.640]   Self circles, semicircles, ovals.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.880]   Well, one of my friends was suggesting
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.160]   that we should have self-tagging, self-circulating.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.080]   But that-- I don't get that way.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.720]   Put yourself in a circle.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.480]   You could nominate yourself.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.080]   As ironic.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:49.160]   I do like it that you cannot tell what circle somebody's put you in.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.160]   It's driving some people crazy.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.040]   I'm really happy about that.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.440]   I use private lists on Twitter.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.200]   Oh, now I want to know.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.400]   I use private lists on Twitter a lot.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.800]   Like, I have this one private VIP Twitter list, which
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.560]   is like my first column in Tweed Deck, which
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.720]   is like the people who stuff I don't ever want to miss.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.480]   And it would just hurt feelings.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.000]   The people found out that I wasn't-- they weren't in my VIP list.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.880]   People get their feelings heard if they find out
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.880]   that you're not following them to begin with.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:17.880]   Right.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.760]   It's speed dial.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.760]   But--
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.120]   Yeah, are you on my speed dial?
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.400]   I'm going to have a scoble moment now.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.160]   So when they did the demo of the calling today on Facebook,
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.440]   I looked really quickly as you were showing it, Leo.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.720]   And I think I saw my niggable list.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.880]   I was so happy.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:32.880]   Oh.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.380]   Oh.
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.000]   So was there-- do we-- you all caught scobles?
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.240]   We have to have a scobles.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.360]   The ultimate scoble moment this week
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:43.000]   was Zuck D-SMS in Skoll.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.160]   Because there was some question about whether--
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.000]   there actually are apparently a few Mark Zuckerberg accounts
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.880]   on Google+, but there's one that has 44,000 followers.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.880]   And there was some question, is that really Mark Zuckerberg?
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.920]   And Skoble was the one who confirmed it was.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.320]   In fact, he was on Twitter on Sunday,
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.600]   and he showed me the text message.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.280]   And then I did a bad thing.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.600]   I scrolled back through it to see what else they talked about.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.480]   With just a flick of the thumb.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.760]   Very-- he kind of busted me on it, too.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.120]   But I figure with Robert--
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.480]   we're all-- he's Robert's an example of this,
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.200]   which is that I know Robert in a way most people don't,
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.760]   because I've known him for many years before he was Robert
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.920]   Skoble.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.160]   And he was a chat remod for me in the '90s.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.400]   So I have a very different relationship with him.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.600]   I adore the guy.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.120]   But--
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:33.600]   I can't know that.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.240]   Just take care.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.240]   But I know he annoys people.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.720]   And sometimes I play along with that.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.240]   But I think it's sweetheart, really sweetheart.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.200]   Oh, he's one of the--
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.720]   he's a very generous, wonderful guy.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:44.920]   Very generous.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.520]   And he also puts up with people making fun of him,
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.720]   because he also is kind of a character of himself.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.400]   He knows it.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.160]   He knows he's playing that character.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.400]   I think it hurts a little bit, though, I have to say.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.640]   Depends on how loving it is.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.880]   Sometimes I just want to give him a big hug.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.560]   And then I look at him and I say, no.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.040]   Let's take--
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.160]   See, like that.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.840]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.520]   Let's take a little break here.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.520]   I, as Ectar, is here.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.240]   He is, of course, one of our news team.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.840]   I have officially named Tom Merritt News Director,
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.920]   so that I.R.s makes you a news minion.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:18.400]   Minion.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:18.920]   I like that.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:19.420]   Yeah.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:19.920]   News minion.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.960]   I'll put it on my business cards.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.240]   Tech News today.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.640]   You'll catch him in just a little bit with the latest news.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.960]   Actually, how are you going to do that?
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.120]   I've been prepping this morning.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:27.440]   Oh, good.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:27.800]   All right.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.440]   Well, it's nice.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.520]   I'm really glad to have you here.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.440]   Coming downstairs and joining us.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.120]   It was a long trip.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.280]   Also with us Gina Trapani of smarterwear.org.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.000]   She's also @ginatrapani on Twitter.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   And don't forget, of course, her great application.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.920]   I would love to see a Google+ version of this.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.880]   That's kind of one of the things that's missing.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.120]   Yeah, we need to plug in.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.120]   Need the API.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.760]   Think up app.com.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:58.200]   And last but not least, the man who wears his penis on his face.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.960]   Well, it's better than your sleeve.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:05.000]   Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com, former television critic.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.240]   Actually, I'll tell you another story.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.320]   I've been a follower and fan of Jeff Jarvis for many years
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.960]   since you worked here in the city in San Francisco.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.960]   You all know you're kidding me.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.840]   Oh, no, absolutely.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.880]   I followed you throughout your entire career this whole time.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.920]   And so when we were talking about who should be on this show,
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.640]   you were number one on the list right after Gina Trapani,
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.040]   who's number zero.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:31.680]   How's that for diplomacy?
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.560]   Number zero won't work my heart.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.640]   I've been a big fan of Jeff's for a long time.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.200]   And I can't remember how we first car spotted.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.320]   Maybe it was through Jake.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.200]   Might have been.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.120]   Jake's been a huge fan for a long time.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.240]   So anyway.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:45.760]   By far.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.360]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.040]   I think people don't remember that whole TV critic.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.280]   That episode.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:51.840]   Let's take a break.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.280]   We're going to come back with more on this week in Google
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.720]   in just a little bit before we do, though.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.440]   I'd like to talk to you about the secret behind exceptional
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.240]   websites, a great place for people frequently.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.640]   This is one of the most frequent comments or questions
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.920]   I get, particularly on the radio show.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.360]   What's a good web host?
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.160]   And I have to go through a long, elaborate explanation.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.920]   And really, I should just say, look,
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.160]   you don't want to just get a web host.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:22.040]   You want to get a web host and the best software possible.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.520]   And you want to get them together.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.200]   And it's squarespace.com.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.440]   If you're a WordPress blogger, as I am, you're updating--
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.040]   we just got a new update on WordPress.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:32.360]   What is it?
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.840]   3.2 now?
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.080]   You have to, every few weeks, update WordPress.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.840]   SquareSpace, they update it, but they do it for you.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.960]   It's always kept secure.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.600]   Version 6 has been in testing for some time.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.720]   And I can tell you, it's very exciting.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.520]   This is the best software.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.320]   Not just for a blogger for any website.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.760]   First of all, they kind of follow the Google Data Liberation
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:53.400]   Front Model.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.680]   You can get your data in and out.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.160]   They have seamless importing from the movable type,
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.560]   WordPress type pad and blogger APIs.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.360]   They'll copy your posts, copy the images,
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:05.280]   make sure all the links work, all the SEO is preserved.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.040]   But you can also export.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.400]   It goes both ways.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.560]   So you're never trapped.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.880]   In fact, that's good because they have a try-it-free feature
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.840]   that gives you a--
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.000]   we did this.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.120]   I wonder if we-- on Twitch, what was that?
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:20.480]   What was it?
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.640]   Was it Brian as a unicorn.com?
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.960]   Oh, some variation of that.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.160]   Yeah, let's just see.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.120]   We actually created this.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.760]   And I gave out the password.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.640]   Oh, it looks like somebody's modified it again.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.880]   But within-- nope.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.840]   Within seconds.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.320]   There it goes.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.560]   This website was crowd sourced with our--
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:45.840]   With our people in the chat room,
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.880]   people watching the live stream, made this website
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.680]   in Squarespace.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.640]   And that's kind of the beauty of this.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.520]   A fine use of technology.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.120]   Don't you think--
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:54.640]   [CHEERING]
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.400]   --of the university is very proud right now?
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.240]   This is what--
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:57.840]   --we hate this possible.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.120]   This is what the web was made for.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.440]   So let me take you back to squarespace.com.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.240]   Actually, where to go?
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.800]   squarespace.com.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:06.960]   If you click the green button, you
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.360]   could try it for free for two weeks.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.920]   If you decide to buy, do use the offer code TWIG7,
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.080]   TWIG and the number seven, because that'll
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.920]   give you 10% off your new site for the first six months.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:22.480]   So it's a really good deal and a good money saver.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:26.440]   TWIG7, 10% off for the first six months of your account.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.240]   Very affordable, too.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.480]   Remember, you're getting hosting and the software.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.280]   And the pricing starts as low as $10 a month,
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.680]   if you buy for two years.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.920]   The longer you subscribe, of course, the better the choice is.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.000]   Lots of nice features, iPhone and iPad app,
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.840]   that really make it great to post as well as moderate
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.680]   your blog.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.600]   Even get your stats, some great stats on here.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.720]   Photo galleries, forums, form building,
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.560]   and a whole lot more.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.840]   Squarespace.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.080]   Just give it a try, will you?
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.680]   Just press that green button, squarespace.com.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.960]   And if you decide to buy, use the offer code TWIG7,
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.520]   don't forget, 10% off for the first six months of your account.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.240]   The secret behind exceptional websites
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.080]   and Brian is a unicorn.squarespace.com.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:11.520]   If you'd like to see, they did that literally in about a minute.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.440]   Actually, it was a little-- there was a little battle
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.040]   between-- we had different factions doing different things
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:17.540]   with this.
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.240]   Yeah, the chat realm is good for doing things like that.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.480]   During NSFW, if you watch that show--
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.480]   They do that all the time.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:21.980]   They do that.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.920]   There's like, I'd say 50 sites get made during the show.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.480]   Instant.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.400]   Do they use Squarespace?
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:26.720]   I guess.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.680]   They do use Squarespace.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.200]   And there are some phenomenal sites.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.520]   And a lot of Brian is a unicorn, oddly enough.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.200]   Well, he is.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:34.920]   Crowdsourcing.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.680]   Great article by Jim Fowls.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.080]   First of all, as much as I love you, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.000]   I love Jim Fowls.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.360]   I think he's one of the most interesting guys writing,
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.920]   very smart, writes for the Atlantic these days.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:49.400]   And actually, I should say he blogs for the Atlantic.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.800]   But he's a journalist journalist, man.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.000]   He's the real deal.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.680]   He really is.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.200]   His books are fantastic.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.760]   So he brought up an interesting point on Tuesday.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.200]   Google+ versus Facebook, the trust factor.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.360]   And this is something I've been talking about on this show
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.080]   and thinking about for some time.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.800]   Why is it?
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.520]   We sort of trust Google in a way that we sort of don't
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.480]   trust Facebook.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.680]   He quotes Christopher Michael Luna, a divinity student
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.840]   at Harvard, who wrote an essay about the meaning of trust
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.640]   and connection in the social media age in which he says--
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.520]   and it kind of echoes my own sentiment.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.920]   So I want to run it by you guys.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.840]   Quote, "I trust Google in a way that surprises me.
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.880]   I trust them more than any other corporation I can think of
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:37.000]   that he talks about their stand in China.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.160]   And then the fact that Facebook's
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.360]   talking about complying with the Chinese government
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.040]   in order to get into the Chinese market.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.400]   And Microsoft is partnering with the Chinese search
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.080]   engine by Do.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.000]   He says, I'd like to see Google win this war.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.720]   And I know whose side I'm on here.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.680]   I kind of think that leaving Facebook is one way
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.480]   we could participate.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.000]   Now this is a stronger statement than many of us
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.400]   would make.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:59.720]   But it certainly does reflect the feeling a lot of us
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:03.360]   have about Facebook versus Google.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.400]   He says, Google+ is already showing us how it respects
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.880]   the user.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.520]   Whereas-- because they have the data liberation,
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.320]   makes downloading everything you've uploaded,
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.800]   a relatively simple task.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.800]   Of course, you could do that on Facebook too.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.440]   But he says, try and take your photos off Flickr, for example.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.440]   Almost impossible.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:22.640]   What do you guys think?
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.560]   Is something about Google inherently more trustworthy
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.280]   than Facebook?
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.760]   Is it because Facebook has that social network movie that
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.840]   kind of vilifies Mark Zuckerberg a bit?
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.400]   Or are we waiting for a Google channel like that?
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.800]   I don't think it's the movie.
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.160]   I mean, the other thing about Facebook
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.440]   is they seem to hide a lot of things, a lot of settings.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.360]   You're opted in, and you find out later.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.440]   And people get very, very outraged versus Google.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.440]   The one time they did it was Buzz, and everybody
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.520]   got annoyed with that.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.160]   So maybe it's just the frequency in which they--
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.360]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.000]   This maybe capitalizes it.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.280]   This is Jim Fallows talking.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:55.040]   He says, my view is, according to Jim Fallows,
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:58.960]   Google airs and oversteps, as in the Bud case, Buzz case,
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.400]   and can seem threateningly large.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.560]   But in the end, it acts as if it has a conscience.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:08.240]   So far, the record is that if Facebook stops only
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:12.280]   when it's caught, I see you nodding, Gina.
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:13.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:16.280]   I mean, this is why I'm here during this show.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.520]   The Google brand has earned the trust of the tech community.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.400]   And this Harvard student has to be a nerd, right?
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:22.960]   It has to be a key--
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.960]   He's a divinity student, too.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.200]   Well, that's a form of nerdiness.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.160]   It's commonly nerdiness.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.760]   I love being the-- my sister's a minister, but--
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.800]   The reality is that my in-laws didn't weigh what brand
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.000]   they trusted more when they decided to go on Facebook.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.720]   Their friends were there, and that's what they did.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.120]   But for people who are in the industry and think about these
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:44.080]   things and follow Google and see and comprehend
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.560]   the awesome technology that Google has put out the world
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.760]   and what they've done.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.640]   And just their whole-- Google's whole demeanor
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:53.560]   has always been-- the do-no-evil thing hasn't been--
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.600]   hasn't been just talk.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.520]   It feels like they've really walked the walk.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:00.320]   And they appeal to engineers in a very captivating way.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.120]   I trust Google as well.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:06.680]   And my boss, Anil, often questions my blind trust of Google.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.600]   He was the one that pointed out that there were so few women
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.160]   on the service.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.560]   And I said, oh, the number must be wrong.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.080]   Because I can't imagine that's really the case.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:18.600]   So I tend to trust them first, which is probably
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.600]   probably about--
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.000]   They're not infallible.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:21.680]   They're not infallible.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.440]   Far from it.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.800]   That's what fellow is saying is that they are--
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.800]   they make mistakes.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:26.320]   They think.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.000]   I get that sense that they try to do the right thing.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.680]   And everybody I've talked to who are former employees
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:33.960]   and current employees have all said the same thing.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.480]   Like the conversations in the meetings are, is this evil?
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.520]   Will this hurt users?
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.120]   And I think that's easy to do when
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:43.240]   you're making a boatload of money, which they are.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.680]   So yeah, I'm right there with you.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.880]   And that's why I'm doing the show.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.800]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.840]   I think it's well said.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.560]   And one issue in Facebook's problem
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:56.120]   is I think Jim and the Divinity students said it very well.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.240]   But Facebook does kind of just push the edge and wait
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.960]   to get flocked back.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.280]   But they're also dealing with things
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.520]   that are seen to be more personal.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.560]   And the mistake-- the strategic mistake for Facebook,
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:09.040]   I argue, is that they should have started by saying,
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.040]   we're a place to share.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.960]   Not we're a place to hide things or to secrete things,
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:14.480]   right?
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.760]   That we're a place to share.
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:17.800]   But that's not how they're seen.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.160]   Whereas Google, I think, is very smart as they're presented
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.480]   as a place-- this is why the profiles think it's smart.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.320]   This is a place to share.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.000]   Generally, that's what we're here for.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.120]   That's what we do is we drive people two things.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.280]   I think they are good about the don't be evil.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.680]   I think that China stuff, especially
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.720]   Jim is a China hand and he knows it very well,
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.360]   is very important to this.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.360]   And I think there's something else going on, too.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.760]   Two sides of this.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.880]   On the one hand, we also see that because, as Gina said,
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.680]   Google gets big, it gets mistrusted.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.200]   We see that throughout the EU.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.240]   But now the FTC is going after Google.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:54.200]   And I put on the list a New York Times editorial
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.280]   that basically says, as Matthew Ingram summed it up,
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.200]   the short summary of it is, well, we should just investigate
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.000]   them just because they're big.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.360]   And we're seeing that.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.600]   And that's kind of insane.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.600]   On the other hand, there's a story going on in my role
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:10.000]   right now with Rupert Murdoch and the phone hacking
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   scandal in the UK.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.160]   Oh, my god.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.720]   That is beyond ugly and evil right now.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.480]   And if you want to talk about relative trust,
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.560]   here's a supposed journalistic organization
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.040]   that is just absolutely disgusting.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.040]   And here's Google that, yes, it's very big.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.760]   But as Gina just said, yes, they
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.600]   try to super serve their customer
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.480]   and make that their guiding principle.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.840]   And yes, I do trust them.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.400]   I'm a fan boy too.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.880]   And what I like about Google too is they don't treat their users
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.120]   like idiots.
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:38.160]   They go in and say, you're an adult.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.040]   You can understand what it's like to have different lists
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:40.520]   of friends.
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.160]   And you don't know what the difference is between sharing
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.120]   to some people and not others.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:47.680]   They give-- I feel like they give consumers and users choices
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.800]   and control.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.200]   Whereas I feel like other companies kind of just assume
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.520]   the lowest common denominator, this is the default setting,
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.560]   this is what everyone should do, because this is what we
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.520]   think that they should do.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.600]   I think the other thing is that Google's earned a lot of trust
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.440]   simply by having good search results.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:02.640]   When you look up something, you're looking for whatever it is
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.720]   you want, you actually got good results.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.800]   And you're like, I like this site.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.360]   This is actually giving me what I want.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.360]   And so you just started going back and back and back.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:11.000]   And even when you would see their services, other services
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.720]   pop up, you're more likely to go, you know what?
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.400]   I know this service isn't fully baked yet.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.520]   But I'll give them another chance,
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:18.120]   because I trust them from their search results.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.840]   But I do think that Jim raises the question tacitly,
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:25.960]   if not explicitly, that I feel better about Google.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.160]   I'm maybe not sure why.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:28.880]   And I'm not sure I should.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:30.320]   But I do.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:34.520]   And that certainly reflects my opinion.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.720]   And maybe it's irrational.
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:36.440]   Maybe it's not.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.840]   There's a good-- this also in our rundown,
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.480]   it's probably too long for me to summarize.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:45.840]   But Yishan Wang has written a Quora answer.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.040]   How Google+ shows that Google still doesn't understand social,
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.520]   in which he kind of debunks some Facebook myths like that,
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.120]   for instance.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.440]   They keep all your data themselves.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.560]   You can, of course, for the last year
[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.320]   you've been able to export all your Facebook data
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.320]   in a zip file.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:06.920]   It just comes down to a feeling almost, doesn't it?
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.840]   Not a rational thing, but a feeling.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.920]   Or is it rational?
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.120]   But I think, I think Gina's right, is culture.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.080]   I mean, I won't-- I won't--
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:13.440]   Yes.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.160]   --smirk some here, too.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.280]   But I dealt with a certain credit card company--
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.160]   Oh, I love that post, by the way.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.320]   And just, you know, I'm not trying to do a deal.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.800]   I'm in my heart condition.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.920]   I try not to be--
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.120]   I'm dying, and they screwed me.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.120]   But the culture was amazing.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.720]   I went through six employees.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.160]   And when I said, you know, I'm unhappy,
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.200]   and here's why it retained me.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.240]   All they were trained to do was to upsell me.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.640]   Right.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   And, you know, Google-- the irony of Google is,
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.680]   if you have a problem with Google,
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.440]   you can't reach a human being.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.720]   You know, oh, if you could only get to phone mail jail.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.520]   Right.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.920]   We can, because we're in position, we're in.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.280]   We can go on plus, and there's Vic Condotra for God,
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.320]   takes in two minutes saying, you're right, Gina,
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.440]   I'm right on that.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.280]   That's awfully impressive.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.440]   The presence-- and of course, we found out that Bradley Hurrow,
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.720]   which was about to get, you know, proposed.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.880]   We had him on the show last week, and apparently, shortly,
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.520]   thereafter, he flew to Paris and proposed to his longtime girlfriend
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.600]   and was accepted.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.240]   And by the way, I was thrilled to be sharing in all of that on Google
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:15.720]   Plus.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:16.880]   That was pretty cool.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.640]   He put the picture of the ring, and she was--
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.720]   and was it her name?
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.160]   Irene was posting pictures of Paris and their food.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.320]   And I felt like we were--
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.080]   I don't even know.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.880]   I've met Bradley.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.920]   I've hung out with him at Food Camp, but I don't.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.080]   I felt like, wow.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.080]   Wow.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.080]   That's really interesting.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.080]   This is humanizing Google Earth.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.080]   It really did.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   You know what the fact--
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.080]   It is.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.880]   Did you see-- in a whole different way, did you see Marissa's
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.880]   Chiluie light fixture in her house?
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.880]   No, she posted a better light fixture.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.880]   Oh.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.880]   Oh.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:46.880]   Good.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.880]   I've got to find the most incredible--
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.280]   Did you see Gina?
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.680]   I don't see it.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.680]   I'm looking at her profile now.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.080]   Yeah, let's look.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.600]   She put up photos, 83 photos.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   How do you say it, Chiluie?
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   Chiluie?
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.600]   Chiluie?
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   You must be in her circles because--
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.600]   Chilu?
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.600]   Yeah, apparently she does not share that with us.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.960]   Maybe I'll just violate the rules here.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960]   But--
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960]   I want to see her, Chiluie.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.040]   You know who I mean?
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.600]   Who's the artistic class guy?
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.040]   I know what you're talking about.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.040]   I don't know how you--
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.840]   Talking about such an uncultured bunch.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.040]   The Photos tab in her profile.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.040]   You can see--
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.040]   Oh, it's in the Photos tab.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   Oh, there it is.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040]   There we go.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.040]   Chiluie install.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.040]   It is--
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.040]   Oh, my God.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.760]   It is the most unbelievable thing.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:31.920]   Oh, this they have this.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920]   This reminds me.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:40.240]   I feel like I'm at-- what is the hotel in Vegas that has all of this stuff?
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.000]   This is very Vegas of Marissa.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Holy cow.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   Wow.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   There's all the Google colors right there.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   Is it?
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   It is.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   The Persian ceiling mockup in Seattle.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   So she's thinking about getting this, obviously.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   No, no, no, no.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.160]   If you go through quickly, you will see-- there's the installation--
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.960]   Oh, yeah, they're putting it in.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.960]   They're trucking.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.960]   They're trucking.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.960]   Wow, this is very personal.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.960]   You're right.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.960]   There's an Apple store in the background.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.960]   Did you go by?
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:02.960]   Well, now we know exactly where she lives.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.320]   Wow, this is quite an installation.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.600]   I hope they're not geotagged.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.400]   Oh, it is phenomenal.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.800]   It is just unbelievable.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.800]   Thank you, congratulations, Marissa.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.960]   Now you have the Bellagio ceiling in your apartment.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960]   Wow.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.400]   We all watch it.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.120]   Wow.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.120]   This is quite--
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.120]   It's cool.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.120]   Quite incredible.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.320]   So there's a humanity here.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.960]   Googlers are throwing themselves into this.
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.840]   I talked to Jacob Glick, who's their privacy person in Canada.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.080]   And he said, it's interesting.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.680]   You've got to find the right voice because he's still our corporate.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.600]   But they're in here and allowed to be human and be themselves.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.320]   Jeff, do you think this is all on purpose?
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.040]   I mean, like with the campaign, the Dear Sophie campaign for email.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:46.240]   I mean, is this just this-- hey, we're showing you how to use it by using it ourselves?
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.920]   Or is this what they would normally do on a social network?
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.160]   I mean, we just never see that.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.160]   Well, there's something--
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.560]   There's something that puzzles me a little bit.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:58.280]   If you go to socialstatistics.com and you look at the top ranking Googlers are there,
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.760]   Larry Page follows zero people.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.960]   Sergey Brin follows zero people.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.200]   Oh, that's the thing they've hidden who they've circled.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.960]   Oh, have they hidden their circles?
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.080]   Yeah, they-- because you can say don't make the numbers invisible.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.400]   So the number is invisible.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:11.920]   OK.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.880]   So this is why I kind of distrust this a little bit.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.640]   It's not quite reporting the data correctly.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.080]   It's not actually zero.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:20.640]   Because that made me think, oh, these are phony accounts that they're using.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.320]   There's more some data accounts there, which is the other problem.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.200]   But they're--
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:24.720]   OK.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.680]   So they've blocked this for privacy, really.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.040]   It lists me as following zero, too.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:32.640]   But that's just because I hate who's in my circles just to see what happened.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.440]   And that's what happened.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.400]   So it's actually not zero.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:34.960]   OK.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.960]   Tom Anderson's not following anybody either.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.320]   And by the way, the numbers are way out of date.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.200]   Yeah, they are out of date.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.840]   And the number on the profile doesn't match the number on the circles page.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.440]   Not that I care, not that I'm a scroll bull.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.520]   It doesn't mind.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.120]   It doesn't mind.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.000]   11, 852.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.560]   Let me just see you out of curiosity.
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.720]   I think it does, online.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.200]   Yeah, 11, 852.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.200]   Line is now.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.360]   Maybe they just follow me closer than they follow you.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.360]   73.85.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.680]   Is that all?
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.280]   I'm at 91.94.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.640]   Ooh.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.200]   So--
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:05.680]   I--
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.720]   You're speaking in Jeff's.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.800]   So they've got the right number right now.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.040]   So maybe they're updating more often.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.960]   All right, we're going to move on.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:14.240]   I know.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.320]   This is terrible, terrible.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.720]   I am really avoided this.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.840]   In fact, I'm thinking maybe I'll set the number to zero now.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.640]   Because I just really--
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.800]   this was what happened in Twitter.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.480]   And I fell for it big time.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:24.960]   Yep.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.480]   Yep.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.200]   Yeah, well, I think Leo, that's the beauty of it.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:33.000]   I rushed in to get enough people in to make this real experience.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.040]   And now I pull back.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.040]   And the people I want to follow are the ones I want to follow.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.040]   But then, Gina, I really recommend
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.840]   that you go into the incoming.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.200]   Because it's a whole different experience.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:42.560]   What was it?
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.440]   People who are interested in you, it's worth going in there.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.920]   But it doesn't noise up your own stream again.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.360]   I do like how they handle that.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.760]   And it's really nice.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.240]   Because then I get to see a wider diversity of people
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.560]   and interests in incoming without having
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.760]   to devote myself to them.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.680]   Now, something we should point out when Mark Zuckerberg
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.280]   held his awesome announcement this morning,
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.080]   he said a couple of interesting things.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.720]   One, that this is the launching season 2011 for Facebook.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.720]   This is just the beginning of a number of announcements
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.840]   they plan to do in the next few months.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:15.440]   It's very clear Google's in exactly that same boat.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.760]   They've already kind of telegraphed
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.040]   that they're going to change the name and branding of Picasa
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.440]   and Blogger to be something a little more generic photos.google.com
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.600]   and blogs.google.com.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.720]   They've got some very interesting new things--
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.960]   games and questions in the Google code.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.380]   And we're seeing the slide folks coming out
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:41.320]   with a ton of interesting things like prizes, pool party.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:45.120]   This is going to be a very hot summer for social media.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.680]   And you've got two super--
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.440]   the superpowers of social media here.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.480]   Twitter is kind of-- I have to say,
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.080]   really feels like Twitter is getting left in the dust at this point.
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:59.720]   Yes, President Obama had a Twitter press conference this morning.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.440]   But it was interesting enough, Jack Dorsey,
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.440]   who hosted that for Twitter, not Ev, not Biz, both of whom
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.240]   have moved on.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:10.080]   And they're kind of restarting up obvious, the parent corp.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.040]   Well, we also have the FTC investigation into Twitter.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.400]   Well, but every FTC seems apparently investigating everybody.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.960]   Well, that's interesting too, I think, though.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.000]   It goes to the developer issue there.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:21.640]   Well, it does.
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.560]   And we talked about that last week.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.040]   And you're right.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.960]   I mean, I think that there are some negatives
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.600]   in what they're up to.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.080]   Maybe that actually wasn't last week.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.400]   We talked about that.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.360]   He also said a couple of interesting things.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.720]   He confirmed the 750 million user number, which we'd heard before from journalists.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.120]   But that is true.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.200]   But this is what I thought he said that, to me, we need to parse a little bit.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.840]   He said, the last five to seven years of Facebook,
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.400]   the metric to watch was user growth.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.880]   Kind of analogous to this numbers conversation we're having here.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:57.280]   He said, for the next five years, the question to ask is, what kind of cool stuff
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.760]   you're going to be able to build on the social graph?
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:03.320]   In other words, don't expect this kind of growth forever.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.960]   Of course, you can't because you ran out of-- you can't.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.400]   There's always so many people in the world.
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.200]   But also, it's enough now.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.240]   We've reached such a good critical mass.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.880]   And I think you'd say the same for Twitter and certainly for Google.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:18.520]   That now what's really interesting is, what do you build on that social graph?
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:22.200]   What innovative things do you do with that information now that you have it?
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.800]   He's basically saying, this is the thing to watch from Facebook going forward.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.800]   It's a lot of people.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.800]   Facebook is the internet.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.480]   There's always been this-- not always.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.560]   There's been this rumor for a while now about Project Spartan, the idea that there's going
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.000]   to be mobile applications based on Facebook and using that.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.240]   By the way, we saw zero Project Spartan.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.440]   There is no iPad.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.440]   There was no Spotify announcement.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.440]   Why don't you season, though?
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.000]   Maybe we'll see it eventually.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.520]   But this is the kind of stuff.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.320]   I mean, this is what we normally use the internet for.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.680]   We use that for web apps and we use it for regular stuff.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.280]   When people want to stay on Facebook all day, I mean, it makes sense to just try to spin
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:55.200]   it because, like you were saying, Leo, they can't keep growing.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.920]   It's just not possible unless everybody has to accounts for a farm bill, which a lot of
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.920]   people do.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:01.920]   All right.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.160]   I want to get this wrapped up here.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.360]   Let me see if there's any other big stories that we need to cover.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:10.680]   The Nortail patents went to Apple, not Google.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.000]   I don't know if that's going to be a big deal in the long run for Android.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.960]   It might be Apple, Rimm and Microsoft now have those 6,000 patents, which means Google,
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.960]   which tried to get them.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.960]   Didn't try very hard.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:28.720]   They used their last bid was pie 3.14159 billion dollars.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.720]   Nerd.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.720]   Really?
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.120]   That was their last bit.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.360]   All three bids were mathematical constants.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.360]   No.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.360]   You didn't.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.360]   Let me see if I can find you.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.360]   Oh, I missed that.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.360]   It's kind of cute.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.360]   Why?
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:46.360]   That could have been your number, Jeff.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360]   There were three numbers.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.360]   I have a certain price.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.360]   I have a certain price.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.360]   I can't remember what they were.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:56.720]   Do you remember chatroom with the three numbers words at Google bid?
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.760]   I'm going to have to find it now.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.240]   I have a student of mine who started a start book called Notebooks with a cave, by the way,
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:07.040]   folks, who has pie tattooed around his arm.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.040]   That's cute.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:14.240]   So the first bid was 1.902160540.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.440]   Their second bid was 2.614972128.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.280]   And their third bid was 3.14159.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.240]   All three math nerds tell me.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.200]   No, not Fibonacci.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:34.160]   All three are apparently mathematical constants, although I'm having a hard time.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:38.960]   But the journalists aren't smart enough to know what the mathematical constants are.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.960]   Let me see if I can opt it.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.680]   But the CDC knows.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.680]   The Guardian knows.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:47.280]   What does the Guardian say?
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.280]   I saw that article, but I can't get it to tell them.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.880]   Billion dollars times pie.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.120]   And that wasn't the other.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.120]   Broons constant.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.120]   Broons constant.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.120]   Okay.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.440]   And let's see what I'm saying.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.720]   And Michael Merton's.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.720]   Michael Merton's.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.720]   Constant.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.480]   Reuters called it mystifying.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.720]   It was bit mystifying.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:05.720]   And it did for us.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   It was Google.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.720]   You could look it up.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:14.040]   And the final bit 3.1459, which was pie, of course, was just below the what it was.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040]   4.5 billion.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040]   The consortium.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.040]   There's six companies that bought it.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.240]   And Google's not part of that.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.440]   Not part of that consortium.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.520]   Have you installed the new?
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.360]   You probably saw this because I accidentally showed my Gmail account.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:28.160]   The new Gmail template.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.160]   The simplified template.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.520]   No, I haven't.
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.520]   I did.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.520]   I like it.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.520]   I like it.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.520]   I like it.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.320]   I'm with the dense version.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.320]   So you get more data.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.120]   Yeah, to get more data on the screen.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.440]   But yeah, I like it very much.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.440]   What do you guys think?
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.440]   I'll go together.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.880]   Just go into themes, actually.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.400]   It's the last theme.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.640]   Settings, themes.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:53.560]   And but apparently this is this is a precursor to something Google is going to do globally.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.560]   They're going to change.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.560]   It's right down here.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:00.080]   Yeah, it's doing kind of a global redesign or visual refresh across all the products.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.600]   I believe it's calendar, reader, and Gmail.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.680]   They're going to kind of do this.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.920]   They're going to iterate over time slowly across the different products.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.000]   So we're going to see this kind of roll out over the next few months and they're going
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.160]   to be watching for feedback and no doubt doing maybe some A/B testing or that kind of thing.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.800]   But yeah, I mean, the bar, the Google+ bar kind of showed up everywhere.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.360]   I think that that's just rolling.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:25.520]   You know, those changes are rolling out along with kind of a general, general refresh.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.920]   That Google bar isn't on the YouTube site yet, right?
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920]   No.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.280]   So in one place, it's not kind of--
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.280]   That seems like the share button would be perfect right there.
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.280]   I know.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.440]   It's very odd that it's not built right in.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.440]   Now, that's a good point.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.440]   It's true.
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.440]   There's quite a bit of autonomy.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.680]   In fact, that's one of the things Vic told us because I was really a lobbying for a pool
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:42.680]   party.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.240]   You know, pool parties, they're Instagram.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.240]   It's written by the folks.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:53.360]   I remember they bought slide and apparently the slide folks have a huge, huge amount of
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.360]   autonomy.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.320]   So that the pool party program, which is their kind of Instagram killer, uses Facebook
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.880]   Connect and not Google+ at all.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.880]   Wow.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.880]   Okay.
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:11.600]   And Vic said, oh, I just got mine invite yesterday.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.560]   So apparently you could be senior vice president at Google and not get an invite.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.560]   They're not playing favorites.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.560]   That's good.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.560]   They're not playing favorites.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.760]   They're not.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.240]   Spotify is in the US.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.720]   We were thinking maybe that was going to be part of the awesome announcement.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.160]   Spotify, the European music system, which has been frankly, you know, very popular in
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:36.360]   Europe and highly demanded in the US.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.560]   Spotify is coming, it says to the US.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:45.480]   Any track, anytime, anywhere, it's free, but you have to sign up and it has not apparently
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:48.080]   has nothing to do with Facebook, even though we'd heard that Facebook would be involved
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.080]   in this.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.560]   That's been coming longer than the Messiah.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.560]   I know.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.200]   Mark Zuckerberg says Spotify is so good.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:58.480]   Demi Moore says Spotify is genius.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.480]   How the hell do they know?
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:00.480]   What does Demi know?
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.120]   My theory is that it doesn't really exist.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.960]   I think it's a, it's a trick.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.680]   It's the Germans are playing a trick on us.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.960]   It's their, it's the Germans getting back for Google street view.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.640]   We have Spotify and you don't.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:20.120]   You are so behind the times.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.800]   Uh, any other stories I'm trying to go through these real quick.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.880]   Oh, I think you hit them.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.360]   Real time search gone.
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.760]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.440]   That's the one that used Twitter, right?
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:31.440]   Is that just because the Twitter deal is up?
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.920]   Twitter deal was over real time search.
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:38.120]   When you did a search, you could have real time results coming in streaming in from Twitter.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.240]   Begs the question.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.480]   What the hell?
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.680]   Why are they using Twitter?
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.200]   Why aren't they using other things?
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:46.520]   They try to get Facebook.
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.680]   They can never get that deal.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.240]   Bing locked up Facebook.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:54.080]   Interesting, like the obvious alternative, but now with plus, I mean, Google has put it
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.080]   up somewhere.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:57.640]   I can't find it on one of their sites, but it's on one of them.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.760]   It says that they are looking to integrate Google plus once it comes back.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.720]   So, so real time will have plus good streaming once it probably goes live for all.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.960]   I hope that's true.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.360]   Let us take a break.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:16.440]   We're going to come back quickly and get Gina Tarpani's tip of the week.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:21.640]   Jeff Jarvis is number of the week and my tool of the week.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.660]   But first my friends, a word from the folks at Netflix.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.480]   Just a quick word.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.960]   Sign up today 30 days free.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.960]   If you don't have Netflix, what the hell?
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.400]   Get it.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.840]   And now we return with our program.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.840]   I mean, really?
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.880]   Do I need to say anything else?
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.120]   $7.99 a month for unlimited streaming.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.360]   It's incredible.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:46.360]   You know, I have to say though, I am a Comcast customer and a cul-de-sac.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.240]   I watch Netflix every night.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.760]   Every night, everything slows down on the internet.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:56.240]   And I think, I think in this cul-de-sac, every house they're watching Netflix.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:00.680]   We now know that something like 30% of all prime time traffic is Netflix streaming.
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.320]   And I think that Comcast, you need to give me some more bandwidth because everybody's
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.640]   watching Netflix.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.320]   I just watched a Firefly and Serenity that was a long weekend.
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.320]   Like rewatch it.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:11.320]   Summer Cloud.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.320]   Great series.
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.320]   So great.
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.320]   Summer Cloud.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.320]   It's just great.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.320]   So if you don't have it, get it.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.440]   Do us a favor because we desperately need your support.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:24.040]   If you're not going to buy a brick, just tell a friend about this free deal, 30 days
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.040]   free of Netflix.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.200]   Netflix.com and just make sure they go to Netflix.com/twit.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.720]   That's all.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.080]   You could buy a brick later.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.080]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.080]   All right.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.440]   Now, I don't want to leave you out, I as, but this is the part of the show where we do
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.760]   the tool tip and the number.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:43.760]   So if you could think of something you'd like to throw in there, go ahead, but let
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.200]   me start with Gina Trippan and her tip of the week.
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.200]   Yeah, sure.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:52.480]   This was a Google+ tip that I just found out about.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:58.600]   If you want, you can hide who you are, who is in your circles and who has you in their
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.600]   circles.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:05.840]   Not saying that you should, Jeff, just saying that you can, just in case, by the fault,
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.200]   it's public.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.760]   But if you want to hide it and you'll show up in social statistics as having zero, you
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.680]   just go to your profile and hit edit.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:17.520]   And if you click on the area where it says, you know, in Gina circles or have Gina in
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.720]   circles, you can click there and you can uncheck a box that says, show people in my
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.720]   circles or show people have added you to your circles.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.840]   Only if you want, I, public is better, but kind of interesting to know that you can, if
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.840]   you don't want to broadcast your, who you're following, you can do that.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.600]   That's a good idea for those of you who wish to hide.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.120]   See, you cowards.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.120]   You don't want to--
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.120]   You cowards.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.760]   Actually, I'm going to, I'm going to turn mine back on.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.400]   Yeah, but you proved that it was doable.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.400]   We saw it.
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.400]   Yes.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:47.040]   And you can set it to anyone on the web can see who's in your circles or just your circles,
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.040]   can see who's in your circles.
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.880]   So there's some granularity there too, which is nice.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.480]   They can't see what circle again.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.480]   Right, they can't see the name of the circle.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.480]   Just that they're in your circles.
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.720]   That'll be the first bad leak.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:57.720]   That would be bad.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.600]   That's what you know what's going to happen.
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.600]   You know what's going to happen.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.720]   Oh, I'm in his, he's in a whole circle.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.720]   Right.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.280]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week's up.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:14.280]   A few choices here, we have Twitter is now seeking a $7 billion valuation in its next
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.280]   round.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.360]   200 million tweets a day.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.920]   Right, but no business model.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:23.920]   And the other number that fascinated me that everybody knows is Microsoft, congratulations,
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.760]   Hotmail for being 15 years old.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.760]   God, that's amazing.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.760]   It is.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:32.560]   It makes me wonder what is the useful life of any of your services.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.920]   You know, Hotmail still exists.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.560]   As long as they're relevant.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:39.560]   Revalent.
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.560]   Revalent.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.760]   They're revealing things.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:48.320]   Actually, it is interesting because we act as a Facebook, Google, Twitter, they're going
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.520]   to be around forever.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:50.520]   And that's not the case.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.280]   15 years from now, who knows?
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.240]   I still get over.
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.240]   My space too.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:01.640]   By the way, Tom Anderson on Google Plus is now pointing out that MySpace had Skype in
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.640]   2004.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.640]   It's chat.
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.280]   Oh, yeah, and that news about Google Plus being in real time, Google announced it on
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.280]   Twitter.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.280]   Just now?
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:10.280]   No, that's where I found it.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.880]   That's where the announcement's from.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.360]   So everyone's using each other services.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.520]   Oh, 15 years from now, we'll all wonder what this is all about.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.080]   Can I plug one more thing?
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.080]   Yes.
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:29.160]   I'm going to be at Google HQ on Monday doing a privacy talk for Googlers at noon.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:32.120]   So if you're a Googler, and we know many, listen.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.120]   12 noon.
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.120]   Oh, at Twitter.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.760]   You're doing a talk for Google?
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:36.760]   Go at Google.
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:37.760]   Oh, sorry, sorry.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:38.760]   Okay.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.560]   Fortunately, I don't have time to come up to to pedal.
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.720]   I was going to say, why don't you come up?
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.720]   You don't have to.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:43.720]   I wish I could.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:47.280]   I'm going out and I'm hitting that and then hitting glam on Tuesday and then going down
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.320]   to see Bill Gross at IDLAB on Wednesday and then back home.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.280]   Oh, and the reason that is that you will be broadcasting on Twig next week from IDLAB,
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.040]   and I think we're going to have Bill Gross on, yes?
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.040]   I'm trying to get him.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.920]   I'm trying to read yet, but I'm trying to get him, yes.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:00.920]   Yeah, that would be wonderful.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.800]   I told them we were all excited.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:06.920]   Fascinating guy who really was the first to create a startup incubator, I think.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.920]   Yep.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.920]   IDLAB.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:16.920]   My tool of the week is something I've been, you know, I'm a big fan of alternative launchers
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.720]   on the Android phone, and you know I'm a big Android user.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:20.720]   I really am.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.440]   And I loved it because M.G.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:27.480]   Seagler on Google+ was saying, I would send you pictures if the Android app on the
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:32.920]   iPhone, if the Google+ app on the iPhone let me, and I had to say for the first time,
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.440]   you should get a real phone M.G.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.440]   that iPhone.
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.760]   Maybe you ought to think about it.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.280]   I wonder how many people are thinking about Android phones at this point.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.920]   Well one of the nice things you can do with an Android phone is you can change the launcher,
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.800]   which really changes the whole way the phone looks.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:50.280]   And we've all tried a lot of different launchers.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.240]   I was using launcher pro for a while.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.080]   I know I'm a little late to the game at this.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:59.520]   Mylene Rivera, who hosts are all about Android show said, what of course you have to use
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.240]   Go launcher X.
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:03.440]   This is the, this it's free, which is nice.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.280]   In fact, the way they monetize is cool.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:13.400]   They sell themes for Buck 99 or so, and they have a lot of additional plugins.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:18.240]   This is a very attractive, very usable launcher.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:23.200]   And unlike a lot of launchers, it doesn't seem to cause stability issues.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.480]   I just think they've done a very, very nice job.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.840]   So that's kind of my favorite launcher these days on Android.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:35.400]   And one I think a lot of people would like a lot of launchers among other features you
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   get.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:41.200]   Now this is gingerbread by the way, hacked gingerbread on the G2X.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:47.480]   You get a full length bar across the bottom, but you can also have additional bars across
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:51.160]   the bottom, which means you get a lot of functionality built into there.
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:54.160]   You can see my G plus widget right there on the front page.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.640]   This is one of the features I really like.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:22:02.320]   You can pinch to see all of the home pages and it's easy to add home pages and even rearrange
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.400]   home pages in a very Apple like fashion.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.360]   Just a few of the really nice features of this.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.120]   It's absolutely free.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:14.600]   Go launcher X, go launcher EX from the Go launcher dev team.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.600]   That's my tool of the week.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.600]   Downloading now.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.600]   Yeah, I really like it.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.480]   I'd like to hear what you think about it.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.480]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.680]   You use a Nexus One or Nexus S?
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:26.400]   A Nexus S right now, yeah.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.400]   And I'm not, it's naked.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.920]   I'm not using a launcher right now for a while.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:33.040]   I was using slide screen and I dabbled with launcher Pro, but yeah, I'll check this one
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.040]   out.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:37.000]   Yeah, you know, a lot of times I take the launcher's office, but the gingerbread launcher, while
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.880]   okay, is missing a few little things like that, more elaborate taskbar at the bottom
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.880]   there, then I just kind of get attached to there.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:50.040]   A lot of Go launcher X widgets too, which are pretty cool.
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.400]   All right, I think we're out of time.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.760]   I think it's time for Tech News Today.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:53.760]   I ask, don't move.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.760]   Well, I gotta move over there.
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.760]   No, don't let them have this.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.760]   I have four in double duty.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:22:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.240]   Possession is nine tenths of the law.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.720]   You keep, you know that you're a lawyer.
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:03.720]   Keep the seat.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:04.720]   Don't move.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:05.720]   All right.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:06.720]   All right.
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:07.720]   All right.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.720]   All right.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:09.720]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.720]   Thanks for having me guys.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.720]   On the Twitter view is @IAS.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.720]   I-Y-A-Z.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:13.960]   That's me.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.280]   And are you, you know, he used to do a podcast called This Old Nerd.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.800]   Yeah, just relaunched it two weeks ago.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.800]   Oh, good.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.800]   So it's back.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.800]   Yay.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:22.800]   So where would we find that?
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:23.800]   That could be at thisoldnerd.com.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.800]   Good.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.800]   Check it out there.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.880]   Or just follow me on Twitter because I will tweet about it nonstop.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.120]   And then when you're on plus, it'll be there too.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.120]   Good.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.120]   Yeah, you're a plus user now?
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.120]   Yes, you are.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.280]   We are all plus users.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.480]   Gina Trapani is @smarterwear.org.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.040]   She's also at ThinkUpApp.com and @GinaTrapani on Twitter.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.720]   Yes, I'll see you all in three shows.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:47.560]   Have fun at showboyage or however you say it.
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:48.560]   Thank you.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.560]   Great talk.
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.560]   Peking duck, you got to have.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:52.560]   OK.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.560]   But why, there's so much.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.560]   The food is so good.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.200]   If you go to Xi'an, you got to have dumplings.
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.200]   They're famous for their dumplings.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.200]   Oh, I cannot.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.200]   I am going to use dumplings.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.200]   So is Shanghai actually.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.200]   Yeah, dumplings are great.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.200]   Peking duck.
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.200]   OK.
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.200]   OK.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.200]   All right, I've got a list.
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.200]   Yep.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.200]   But I'm really going to miss you guys.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:11.040]   I'll see you in three shows or three shows from now in the news video.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:11.880]   In the news studio.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:12.880]   It's awesome.
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.720]   Say go buy to the cottage.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.200]   And everybody out there buy your brick.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.200]   I bought one.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.600]   You all buy your brick.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.200]   Thank you for the plug.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.960]   Bricks.twit.tv.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:28.600]   I'll tell you, when you come and see the wall of honor there, all the bricks we've got,
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.080]   we broke a thousand bricks.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.280]   So it's going to be fairly long.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.520]   It's so cool to see all those messages and things.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.520]   It's just really neat.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:38.240]   And it does help us build this new studio, which ended up costing, well, I just got
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.240]   a quote for the curtains in my office.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.400]   Curtains $20,000.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.560]   No, we are not going to do that.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:45.560]   Don't worry.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.560]   They're made out of iPhones.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.200]   It's hard to explain.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:49.920]   It's like what?
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:53.480]   No, I will hang them myself.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.480]   I will make them.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.280]   I will do the opposite of Scarlett O'Hara.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.280]   I will take a dress and make it into curtains and hang them myself.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.200]   Who's your designer of Noldemarkos?
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.680]   Yeah, pretty much.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.680]   Marissa.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.680]   Yeah, no, it's very Marissa.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.400]   It's very easy to get very expensive on this stuff.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:12.400]   We're cutting.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.080]   Believe me, we are being intelligent.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.080]   But things happen.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:21.040]   For instance, we were using a Blackmagic router, 40 in, 40 out, which gives us the capability
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:24.120]   of-- we have 30 cameras.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:30.040]   And it turns out, once we connect it up all the cameras and the video and the Skype, it's
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.040]   not big enough.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.000]   So that was $5,000.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.920]   We now have to buy a $15,000 router.
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.120]   So these things add up.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:43.760]   Your bricks make it possible for me to say-- actually, more like Lisa, our CEO, to say,
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.280]   no, you can do that.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.280]   No, you could do that.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.360]   I don't know how long that's going to last.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.920]   Yeah, you could do that, Leah.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.920]   Brixt.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.320]   Okay, you could do that.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:55.920]   Brixt.twit.tv, I promise it won't go to curtains in my office.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.280]   Jeff Jarvis is in charge at buzzmachine.com.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.280]   That's his great blog.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.760]   It's a must-read.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.960]   His new book, Public Parts, is due out next September, I guess.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:06.960]   September.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.360]   And he's also on the Twitter at Jeff Jarvis.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.640]   And his latest book is, What Would Google Do?
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:13.640]   That is a great read.
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.320]   You should read that.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.600]   Thanks everybody for being here.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:21.640]   We do this show every Wednesday, about 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:27.720]   That's 2,000 UTC at live.twit.tv, but you can always catch it after the fact by going
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:33.160]   to TWIT.tv/twig for this week in Google.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.160]   You can subscribe, get it automatically.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.400]   Listen every week, just like all the Googlers do.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.400]   Thanks for being here.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.400]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:39.400]   Bye-bye.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:42.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.020]   (upbeat music)
