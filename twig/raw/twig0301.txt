[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.680]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.320]   Leo Leport here with Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis from the CUNY Labs
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.280]   in beautiful downtown New York, New York.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.000]   Meatballs make you mellow.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.360]   That was a very mellow beginning.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.440]   I am mellow.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.840]   I've been eating meatballs.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.080]   No, you know why I'm mellow?
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.400]   Well, we'll talk about it in a second.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.480]   Let me introduce Kevin.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.640]   Kevin Marks is also here.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.560]   We love Kevin from his garden, the chirping birds signal,
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.280]   the arrival of spring, or of the new tone extension.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.920]   For Google Chrome.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.640]   Hi, Kevin.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.160]   Kevin Googler and Appler, a British telecomer, a sales
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.480]   forcer.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.400]   And now he's a gardener.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.360]   And now Indy.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.680]   Now Indy.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.080]   Indyweb is a wonderful thing.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.360]   We're going to talk a little bit about some Indyweb stuff.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.580]   But the reason I'm a little mellow-- it's not merely
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.080]   mellow.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.560]   I'm kind of sad because this is Letterman's last night.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.560]   And boy, I just--
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.480]   I remember Carson's last night.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.800]   I remember Bette Midler saying, one for my baby,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.600]   one for the road.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   I just--
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   It's the end of the--
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.320]   Carson was the comic model for my father's generation.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.800]   Yes.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.200]   Letterman for my generation.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.040]   Our generation.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.720]   Very much.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.080]   And I would argue John Stewart for Sunday
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.480]   Jakes.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.520]   I think you're right.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.240]   But Letterman definitely was the voice
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.360]   we tried to emulate in comedy.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.560]   And then telling a joke and a story and an attitude.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.440]   And he changed--
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.400]   He just did so much.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.120]   I feel bad to this day about the whole Leno thing.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.680]   But in the end, I think what tonight--
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.200]   what's it is-- this proves right now
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.400]   is that he won in the end.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.880]   I think so.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.520]   He's much more respected, much more loved, much more
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.440]   of an innovator.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.840]   Leno turns out to be a low heart buffoon,
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.440]   poor, poor, lump of monastic humanity.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.720]   And kind of with you.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.560]   And it's funny because Dave's known
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.920]   for being kind of cranky and snarky and sarcastic.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.880]   But there was this-- just as with Johnny,
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.160]   there was an undercurrent of kind of Midwest good old boy.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.360]   Nice guy.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.760]   And the thing about-- I think Dave Stewart was--
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.120]   and this is how it's turned for me too-- is honesty.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.800]   Yes.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.960]   Leno was just one big fake--
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.200]   It was showbiz.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.800]   He was the old showbiz.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.400]   And that's what Letterman was an antidote to in the '80s
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.680]   and then '90s.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.760]   Was it to that whole showbiz thing?
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.720]   He always kind of deprecated that and hated it.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.160]   So I just put up two letters that Dave sent me
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.920]   when I was a TV critic.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.880]   These are my most prized possessions.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.080]   Where'd you put them?
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.600]   Under the other-- as a tweet.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.320]   They're very minor, but they are
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.120]   my absolute prized possessions.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   All right.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.560]   Under other as a tweet-- OK.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.840]   There you go.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.040]   You mean on the Twitter?
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.400]   There's a Twitter tweet, the thing.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.120]   What did he say?
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.120]   So he said, I just wanted to thank you for saying
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.600]   such nice things about me.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.440]   I predicted the sport.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.400]   This is when he was going through the Leno fight
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   losing the tonight show.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.640]   It kind of blows me that that was 22 years ago.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.400]   And the amazing blows me away.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.400]   I just thought--
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.680]   It's like, what?
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.960]   I was in the C-letterhead.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.560]   This is a CBS letterhead just thanking me
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.560]   for a review of the show.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.160]   So I mean, as time your friend, Dave, he hated critics.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.440]   He wouldn't even let us into the show.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.840]   I went there once, and what we weren't allowed in despised us.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.440]   But still, I have such respect for him
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.360]   and to have gotten within a mile of him.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.360]   It was amazing.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.880]   So I'm going to miss you, Dave.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.480]   Even though I was too old to stay up late to watch you.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   Well, that's the sad story.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   As none of us watched it.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.280]   And now who watches Jimmy, Jimmy, or Colbert?
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.040]   We're going to watch them all on John Oliver and John Stewart.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.640]   No, not even Tebow.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.640]   You watch them on demand.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.720]   It's the best bets on YouTube.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.080]   On YouTube, yeah.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.640]   I must admit, I'm quite here because I barely watch any of these things.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.080]   And I only have the loosest idea of letting them in a thing.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.520]   I mean, I understand the cultural legacy of it.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.920]   Well, that's the deal.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.200]   Yeah, I mean, Carson really was the kind of show
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.800]   where everybody watched it.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.640]   And then you kind of wanted to talk about it the next morning.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.120]   It was a water cooler conversation.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.440]   And so for some reason, it really was must watch,
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.760]   even though it was really late at night.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.640]   But I think the habit of late night television viewing kind of died out.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.320]   Probably thanks to Tebow and VHS and stuff.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.160]   I mean, Jimmy and Jimmy are both good.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.880]   They're both wonderful.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.000]   But what young person watches anything scheduled?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.680]   Right.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.160]   Nobody.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.760]   Nobody.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.840]   And thank God, that saved Saturday Night Live.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.040]   Because it was usually only one or two good skits.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.720]   And so the fact that you just watched the clip really
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.360]   saves you hours of wasted time every week.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.520]   I'm going to miss John Stewart.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.080]   I think when's his last show?
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.480]   Or did he already have it?
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.320]   No, no, no, it's coming up.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.840]   I think I'll have the same kind of feeling, although, yeah, for, I guess,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.920]   for our generation, because Letterman was on for 33 years.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.520]   He's really for-- I mean, we started watching in our 20s, right?
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.920]   So that's really why it means so much, I think, to our generation in particular.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.320]   You can--
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.320]   You can't be--
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   You're scared.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.320]   When Conan retires, you guys will understand.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.000]   Colbert's taken over.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I think that's going to be interesting.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.920]   Is he going to be Colbert or Colbert?
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   Colbert.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   So he will keep the--
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.920]   But without the Colbert character.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.920]   Without the character.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.240]   I'm dying to see what he's like without the character.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.400]   I think he'll be good.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.120]   I was talking about this with Jake last night.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120]   He's a little nervous about it.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.520]   But I think he's very--
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.080]   I mean, Jake, thanks to Jake, I went to see the show.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.360]   And he does the pre-warm up stuff.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.360]   He's quick.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.880]   He's clever.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.880]   He started with Letterman.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.320]   He's one of his writers.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.400]   And then, of course, Sean Oliver, who is the dark horse who
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.960]   surprised everybody, except me because I listened to his bugle
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.400]   podcast for years.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.360]   The funniest podcast ever.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:08:00.560]   And so I knew that Oliver was a gem, although I was a little disheartened when HBO looked
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.960]   like so blatantly copied The Daily Show.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   Yes.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.960]   Though I think we've found his mission on the show.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   Or he's factually different.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.840]   And it's actually almost a documentary show, which is very interesting.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.040]   He takes on a big topic, which is risky, because most of the topics really work.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.440]   His school testing one was great.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.800]   But not everyone is the gem.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.520]   And he's committed to doing a 12-minute gem.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.520]   And that's hard.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.520]   It's hard.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.600]   But boy, he's made a big difference in our world.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.440]   I think maybe you're trying to give him credit to turning around the net neutrality conversation.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.440]   Yep.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.080]   Well, and patterned, software patterns and other bad patterns recently.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.320]   He's taken on some big sacred cows.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.800]   He did the piece he did on testing a couple of weeks ago.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.120]   I hope made people aware of what is going on in education in the United States.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.120]   It's not good.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.760]   It's not good at all.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   I love the birds.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   They're really, they're active.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.760]   Must be mating season.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.760]   It's everything.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   That's not chirp.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   That's Kevin.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.760]   It's.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.720]   We've had the nests of hatch.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.520]   There were nests in our canopy here, but they seem to have hatch.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.240]   You need some cats to cut down the population.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.840]   Oh, we've got a cat.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.280]   You can't see cats been by.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.640]   I've got cats and dogs and birds here.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.640]   So next week.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   Next week.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.000]   We need to tie a towing jerry show.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.160]   Next week, Jeff will be in studio with us because he's coming to town.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.760]   Google I/O starts a week from tomorrow.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.760]   Yay.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:34.680]   And already some rumors, according to Bloomberg, Google will be unveiling a new photo service
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.520]   separated from Google Plus.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:43.600]   This would be just another nail in Google Plus's coffin.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   It makes me sad.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.440]   I was sad when Buzz closed.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:53.160]   I was at when I was at Newsgeist in Helsinki, which is a news saying that Google did to
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.400]   just loop some squeaky wheels in Europe.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.560]   But I, you know, so it's Googlers and it's news people.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.520]   And I did my standard joke about how, you know, I still like Google Plus.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   It always gets a laugh.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.520]   It is a constant laugh line now.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.920]   But I like it.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.920]   I do too.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.840]   And I like it more because there's fewer people there.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.400]   It turns out I realize that really this I like social networks when it just people like me.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.360]   And as soon as normal people get in there, I don't.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.760]   It's like, come on, I don't need any more up worthy posts.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.560]   And you start, you start to see that in Google Plus.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:33.760]   You start to see that same kind of Facebook re re sharing of, you know, garbage.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.480]   And that, that to me is the beginning of the end for any social network.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.520]   Such as Twitter has gone post.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.760]   It posts that now Twitter is something completely.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.840]   I don't know what Twitter is, but it's something completely different.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.120]   So the new photo tool, which will let users according to this, according to Bloomberg,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.080]   post images to Facebook and Twitter.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.320]   Yeah, last.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:07.400]   Finally, it's a little bit will greater autonomy photo tool, more freedom to take on rivals.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:13.080]   In other words, because Facebook and Twitter were seen as competitors to Google Plus.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.560]   You couldn't share to them.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.760]   I thought there was some mutual blood there as well.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.760]   Yeah, that's probably true.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.560]   The other thing that's changed was announced was that they're going to Google is indexed
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.520]   in Twitter again, which is not one of these strategy tax things that they think there
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.120]   was some that was at least partly Google and partly Twitter.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.400]   But the fact they couldn't go into agreement on that was a big shame.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.960]   I suspect that was in fighting within Google as well.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.400]   Yeah, because Google had the fire hose, then they then Twitter turned it off, I think,
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.760]   where they couldn't come to an agreement.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:51.000]   Well, they had Google Real Time Search, which was primarily Twitter, but was obviously valuable
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.680]   for them as they were ramping up plus and other things as well.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.600]   Yeah, they wanted to see us.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.000]   And then they couldn't make a deal on the fire hose.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.160]   Twitter asked for too much money.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.320]   Google got too grumpy something.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.880]   All there were some Google Plus strategy tags.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.280]   I think that's quite possible that was part of it too.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.520]   And so that ended up with them getting rid of Google Real Time Search completely, which
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.800]   was a shame because that was actually a useful thing.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.720]   I don't know if you remember using that, but it was something quite helpful.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.480]   And someone's going to act irrationally these days.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.640]   I'm going to bet it's Twitter over Google.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:33.000]   No, I think there was, you know, we can see some of this as pluses being the emphasized,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.160]   but there was definitely some strategy tags coming from there as well.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.160]   And certainly with this photo's discussion and with the Twitter fire hose thing as well,
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.760]   there was definitely a we should be using our thing, not their thing from the plus group.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.840]   Now I suspect that wasn't what the search group wanted.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.560]   And that ended up being one of those internal infighting things because otherwise, you know,
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.840]   why would they have got rid of the real time search?
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.560]   I think if the goal was to put Google Plus in the real time search.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.480]   So how do I get this new thing?
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.480]   Do I search for, I see on search engine land, the story there was hashtag I saw.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.160]   You have to say that you're mobile apparently.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.160]   Oh, I can't.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   It doesn't work from desktop.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.400]   What the report said was that it's mobile only at the moment.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.880]   And I wasn't even sure it was everywhere yet.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.240]   Oh, let me try it on my, my hashtag I zombie.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.360]   Well, let me do hashtag David Letterman because that's trending right now on Twitter.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.840]   So presumably there'd be a lot of content there.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.520]   David Letterman, I hate having this.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.560]   So does it do you have to use a hashtag if you're going to do this search to get the
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   carousel?
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.280]   I've seen the examples.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.280]   So here we go.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   Popular on Twitter.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.280]   Here's the carousel.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.280]   Interesting.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.080]   So that's above normal, the normal search results.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.280]   That's a very high placement.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.280]   Wow.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   Well, you don't get much higher than that.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   It's number one.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.760]   Oh, but it's a lot of real estate.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   Look at this.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.680]   And you get a follow link.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.680]   Can you zoom in a little bit?
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.920]   I think it's hard to read right now and we don't.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.600]   My camera is too far away.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.000]   You get at the bottom, you get a follow link that says more tweets for David Letterman.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.240]   So it's popular on Twitter and then you get this carousel.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240]   And these are tweets.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.320]   I mean, this is James and Carla Murray.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.120]   It's just somebody on Twitter.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.160]   Then, yeah, but this is weirdly curated.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.080]   I'm getting K R Q E news 13.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.080]   I'm getting that too.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.080]   What's that?
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.080]   I don't know why.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.080]   And here's some guy named Steve.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.560]   Who's an who's an ass says good written, David Letterman.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.560]   Please take.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.000]   Please take Jimmy Kimmel with you.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   What do you do?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   What do you Steve?
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   You go to funerals and you say good riddance.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.600]   That's sad, isn't that?
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.440]   That's what's wrong with Twitter.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.480]   Unfortunately, is everybody.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.200]   It makes you feel like everything you have.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.680]   Every little thought that goes through your head is important.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.540]   And everybody says, you know, like has to weigh in on everything, however trivial or silly
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.040]   or irrelevant their thoughts are.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.800]   A lot of grown men crying this month says Sarah.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.440]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.760]   Diane says, look what I found.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.840]   David Letterman sponges from NBC Burbank in the 80s.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.840]   Oh geez.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.840]   You know what?
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.960]   Steve, Steve, Steve's put Bible verses in his Twitter bio.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.120]   Nice and Christian of you, Steve.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.280]   Hey, hey, good readance.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.480]   You should have been dead long ago.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:26.600]   I wonder what I wonder, you know, and then if I do more tweets, this is a link from Google
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.720]   back to Twitter.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.240]   So, okay.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.160]   So that's not really more Google search results.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.680]   And then you get the Google search results and the hashtag turns into the knowledge box
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.200]   and all that.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.520]   Wow, wait a minute.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.680]   Holy cow.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.400]   So you get CBS.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.680]   That's what you should get right right out of the tweets.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.600]   David Letterman's knowledge graph with, you know, Wikipedia stuff.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.760]   And then a link to Twitter is Twitter account.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.160]   Boy, talk when you change tunes.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.080]   Google, you go all the way.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.240]   Twitter is very important now.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.040]   There's just a look for David Letterman.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.840]   I don't get the far look how far down YouTube is.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:14.200]   This will give a lie to all the European you folks who say that they favor their own.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.040]   I mean, YouTube could have very reasonably been.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   Top there.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.160]   Did you put the hashtag in to find this?
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.800]   I did hashtag David Letterman.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.800]   Okay.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.160]   So that's a plain David Letterman won't do it.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.960]   No, that's kind of a signal, I guess.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:36.120]   It's a safe research for the voice because that was last night and was had a lot of Twitter
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.120]   stuff in it.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.120]   I'll make it.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.120]   I'll make it.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.720]   I'll give it a shot by doing the voice one word.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.920]   See if we see tweets.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.920]   Nope.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.200]   I just did hashtag the voice.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.080]   No, hashtag didn't even do it, huh?
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   Nope.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   Huh.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.080]   Here we go.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.000]   So if I scroll down far enough, there's NBC, there's the knowledge graph.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Here's episodes.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.800]   And then there's tweets.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.360]   And then tweets about the voice hashtag on Twitter.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.920]   But that brings you back to Twitter.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.840]   I suppose the thing is, oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.760]   So that's not a search result.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.160]   But they use hashtags for voting.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.360]   So it would be happy to have to look for whatever it is, save, save all of their names.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.680]   Ah, yeah, that's why I use David Letterman because that was a trending topic.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.080]   So I knew that that would, if anything was going to work, that would work.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.520]   So you'd want to use the trending topics, I guess.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.520]   It's interesting.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.800]   But that also implies that there is a strong time component.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.800]   So imagine that would be high last night.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.520]   I, for one, wasn't crazy about the idea of including tweets and search results because
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.200]   tweets are kind of unpredictable.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.000]   Well, as we just saw.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Right.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.960]   So I feel like, I don't know, is that really what I want when I go go a search?
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.920]   But maybe, I mean--
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.160]   I don't think that I think that's not that prominent.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.320]   I think it's kind of like a side one box, maybe.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.320]   Right.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:57.480]   Google researchers create amazing time lapses from public photos.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:04.480]   This is kind of an auto awesome thing, but not to photos uploaded to Google, but wow.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.440]   This is out in the public domain.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.680]   A team from Google and the University of Washington have created an, it's completely
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.040]   automated way to create time lapse videos.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:19.920]   They scour through Flickr and Picasa and other photo sharing sites.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.840]   They sort them by geographic location looking for widely snapped landmarks.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.400]   Oh yeah, this is amazing.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:30.120]   Order the dates, order the photos by date, and then obviously you have to then modify
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.280]   the photos so that everything matches up.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:39.200]   And video below as a creepy in ice there.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.800]   Time lapse mining from internet photos.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.640]   This is University of Washington.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.720]   It's going to go through.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.880]   So all these people take pictures of glaciers, right?
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.160]   But they have to color correct and match, and then you can actually see the glacier melting.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.160]   Wow.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.160]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.960]   Wow, that's really neat.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:09.600]   I mean, it's not a good thing, but here's the building we just saw.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:16.640]   And you can see if when you see the timeline, all the images that they're using, holy cow,
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.680]   what computers can do?
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.680]   It's amazing.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:26.640]   This is interesting because it's like the thing Microsoft did, but in time rather than in space.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.400]   They did photosense, which made a 360 out of multiple pictures.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.800]   For multiple people.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.280]   Whereas this is doing it across time.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.280]   Which is very cool.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.560]   That's a very nice piece of work out there.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.120]   Thank you, science.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.120]   And math.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.480]   Yeah, I mean, also, was that an annual cyclical glacier or was that the same time?
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.480]   That was from 2010 years.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480]   OK.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   So I would say--
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.920]   The glaciers do melt and grow and shrink every year.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.120]   But over 10 years, I think that's more significant.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.080]   Yeah, you can see it because you're a good friend.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.880]   It's definitely a trend.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.440]   Because years ago, when I was doing multimedia stuff, one of the things we did was a thing
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.000]   called Erzist, which was an exhibition in a museum where we did time-lapse stuff, but
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.240]   it was all satellite-time stuff.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.160]   And we had polar ice caps and ozone holes, things like that.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.000]   It's a long time since it was those.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.560]   But it's great to see ground-based stuff.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.560]   You merge--
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.680]   If you've got satellites, it stays in the same place.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.520]   You merge big data, the fact that we now store everything, and it's all kind of accessible
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.720]   with computation.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.960]   Some pretty sophisticated computation.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.200]   It's very interesting what you can get.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.480]   It's not just the one.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.480]   It's not just having big data.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:43.800]   It's being able to parse it to massage it, to get something out of it.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.320]   Maps was hacked again.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.240]   Oh, badly.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.080]   By jerky jerks.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   Yep.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.120]   I thought Google had fixed this.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.600]   Boy, this is just shocking.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:02.200]   It's not like exactly peeing on an iPhone.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.920]   This happened yesterday.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:10.320]   So Google, which had said we are going to change who we let change maps and so forth.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320]   We're going to change everything.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.000]   We lose the opportunity to get people to contribute to public knowledge.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Which trolls everywhere.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Geez Louise.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.120]   But isn't this an indexing thing rather than a labeling thing, isn't it?
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.880]   Oh, so it's using a different searching for a particular phrase.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.520]   So this is kind of Google bombing.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   Yes.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.520]   It's the opposite.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.360]   So they aren't using the Maps tool.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   I miss it.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.440]   There was a weird thing that people did was doing was search Google Maps for your Twitter
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.520]   handle and see where it puts you.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.560]   And for mine, it puts me with Tantec apparently.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.200]   What a surprise.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.480]   That's probably accurate.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   So wait a minute.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.880]   So you search maps for your Twitter handle.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.880]   Yes.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:01.120]   And since Twitter is, if you turn it on and I do, tell it, yeah, I'm right here.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.360]   So yeah, you're quite likely to be accurate because you.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.480]   I tweet with the location turned on.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.480]   So it does.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.480]   Right.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.680]   But a lot of other people were finding very, very strange ones.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.800]   There was somebody was collecting them.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.400]   Let's try Jeff Jarvis.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   Where is Jeff?
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.400]   Let's do that.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.960]   I'll do it for you, Jeff.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.680]   This is going to freak people out.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.680]   Watch.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   I'm counting down.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.200]   I just started the lockdown clock to freak out in Germany.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.560]   What freak out in Germany?
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.560]   Why what's going on?
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.600]   They paid pinpointed where I am.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.440]   Of course, you tweeted exactly where you were.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.440]   Yeah, you already tweeted that.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.440]   Let's see where Jason is.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.440]   You're here, Jason.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.440]   Little off.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.280]   So this is the nearest, is this the nearest, the most recent tweet in time or is it based
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.280]   on all your tweets?
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   I'm not quite sure what it's based on because you're not with Tantec now.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.880]   I searched for things that are getting very strange results.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.680]   They were searching for Ed Miliband MP and getting...
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:54.280]   Yeah, because you're not with Tantec in San Francisco at the panel right now.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.840]   So it's not your most recent.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.680]   But do you have geolocation turned off?
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.080]   I turned on an old family.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.080]   Let's see where POTUS is.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.080]   Oh, he's at the White House.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.800]   Look at that, right.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   Okay.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.880]   So maybe they have iterated this a bit.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   They're just messed up.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.120]   Dr. Mom says she's...
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.680]   Let's see.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.400]   Is it Dr. Mom on Twitter, Dr. Mom?
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   That should be.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.240]   She said to know that's a company called Dr. Mom Presentations.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.240]   That's not you.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.800]   There are runners for her in there somewhere.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   Yeah, I put the...
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   I put the other...
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.440]   What Dr. Mom, what's your Twitter handle?
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.880]   There's a little delay between when she hears this and when she can put that in.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.400]   Oh, well.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.800]   She's in our chat room right now.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.640]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.120]   Is that related to the Google Twitter relationship?
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.800]   It is, Dr. Mom.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:52.160]   I think this was a little meme of this too.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.200]   I think we're searching for politicians on strange things, especially UK ones, without
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.760]   turning up in very odd places.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.080]   POTUS, of course, is President Clinton...
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.480]   President Clinton.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.280]   It will be President Clinton's account.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.600]   I think, can I go?
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.080]   Did you see Bill Clinton tweeting?
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.880]   So Barack Obama tweets from @POTUS.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.880]   Great.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.040]   Finally, after six years, they've given me my own Twitter account.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.760]   What is Clinton ask?
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.200]   He says, "So is it yours or does it pass on to the next owner I've got?"
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.200]   The house.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   Does it go with the house?
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.200]   I've got somebody...
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.520]   A candidate in mind.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:32.560]   And Obama comes back and says, "It's been like, I don't know, but somebody interested
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.560]   in the flotis."
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:40.520]   Because, of course, Clinton will be the first gentleman we've learned, by the way.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.520]   Is that what it is?
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.520]   There's a question, Bill Clinton.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.520]   The handle comes with the house.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   No, anyway.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.520]   So he will be F. Godus.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   I hope it has.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.520]   F. Godus.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.520]   I wonder if they've reserved that yet.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520]   Yeah, I wonder.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.320]   Well, how come POTUS was available?
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.480]   Oh, because Twitter has the ability to keep people off.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.560]   So they get people off of that one.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.560]   Hoping someday.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.400]   Yes, F. Godus has been assigned.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.400]   Huh?
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.320]   There you go.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.320]   First guy.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.920]   That's kind of a desert-duled purpose.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.920]   It could be first gentleman or first guy.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:19.760]   Oh, among those walking into Letterman's Finale, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Steve Martin,
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.760]   Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Jim Carrey, Peyton Manning.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.760]   Oh, my.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.760]   Oh, my.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.760]   Oh, my.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.160]   That's a pretty good lineup.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.000]   Yeah, it is.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.680]   Let's take a break.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.280]   When we come back, we got more.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.600]   We got Kevin Marks and the birds.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.600]   Oh, good.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.080]   We got Jeff Jarvis and the letters.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.680]   And we got here in the Brickhouse FreshBooks.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.840]   FreshBooks was a lifesaver for me when I was a freelancer still and sending invoices
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.720]   or not, truthfully not, sending invoices out at the end of the month.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.200]   I couldn't bring myself to him.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.440]   Ah, it was such a pain.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.400]   I had my invoices in Microsoft Word.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.840]   I wasn't using Excel.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.840]   It wasn't that sophisticated.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.200]   It's just a pain.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.560]   And every day, every month and the 30th, I was supposed to make my invoices send them
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.560]   off.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.720]   And this, the problem was if you don't make your invoices, you don't get paid.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.160]   Fortunately, Amber MacArthur knew about FreshBooks.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.520]   This is when I was going to Toronto one week a month to do the show up there.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.600]   Had to build Rogers, not only for my, you know, my visits, but for expenses for hotel
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.440]   and meals and airfare and that is just such a pain.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.600]   She told me about FreshBooks, what a lifesaver it was.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.960]   First of all, I immediately designed a good looking invoice that could be emailed, made
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.760]   it easy for me to fill out it, just click, click, click, make an invoice.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.760]   It meant I got paid faster.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.720]   In fact, on average, FreshBooks users get paid five days faster.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:49.680]   Partly because the invoice has a pay me button, which lets your client use credit cards and
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.080]   almost all the, you know, the payment methods online.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.160]   And, you know, the truth is clients do want to pay you.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.240]   It's just a much pain in the butt for them to do the check as it is for you to send the
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.240]   invoice.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.600]   Make it easy for them.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.080]   Make it easy for you.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.080]   Get paid faster.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.440]   It's the greatest.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.440]   And incidentally, with the FreshBooks apps, you can capture and manage your expenses.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.400]   Take pictures of the receipts.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.080]   Track your billable hours.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.720]   It's so cool.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.000]   And if you ever need help, they have the best support ever from their offices in Toronto.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.880]   The FreshBooks support rock stars.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.960]   Getting started is easy.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.200]   It's totally free for your first month.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   No obligation.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   You're going to love it.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.080]   Go to freshbooks.com/twig.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.800]   Stop doing this manually.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.280]   Please do yourself a favor.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.580]   Come tax time.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.400]   Your accountant will appreciate it too because the reports are great.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.720]   Freshbooks.com/twig.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.600]   And where they say, "How'd you hear about us?"
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.320]   Just put TWIG.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.400]   Start your 30-day free trial today.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.760]   Freshbooks.com/twig.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.480]   Use Twig as the, "Where'd you hear about us?"
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.680]   Reference.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.000]   Thank you so much for your support, FreshBooks.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.560]   And thank you for making my life a lot easier for many, many years.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.760]   Self-diving cars hit the road.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.360]   Let's hope they don't hit pedestrians in Mountain View this summer.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.200]   Google said, "We're going to put them out there.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.400]   The speed will be capped at 25 miles an hour."
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.760]   And you know, it's going to be those little weird talk-a-toy, rounded little cars that
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.640]   Google showed that have no steering wheel, no accelerator, no brake.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.600]   But that's illegal.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.840]   So Google's going to put temporary steering wheel, brake, and accelerator in there, along
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.840]   with a human.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:35.320]   It just like being the monkey on the first Sputnik.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.560]   It's very similar.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.920]   It's like that barely fit like of the dog in that thing.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.680]   There's no reason for me to be here.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.680]   Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.680]   I don't know.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.280]   See, if you were in a self-driving car, would you, would you, I feel like we talked about
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.280]   the self-driving car.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.880]   No, I'm just saying to people, employee who has asked me to get a gig.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.880]   He would bring the sandwich something to read.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.720]   I'm working for Google.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.720]   What are you doing, son?
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.120]   I'm sitting in a car all day.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.960]   These are this.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.280]   Do you think they design these because this is the right design for this car or just to
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.280]   make people feel better?
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.760]   Like, like, as a mother of a Sony robot that looks like a small human.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.600]   Oh, that's very, that's very Chromebook pixel.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.040]   That light bar on the side.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.000]   Do you think when it hits somebody, it pulses red?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.920]   It looks up your name and, and, and, and, I am sorry, I've hit you.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.680]   So they'll be going through neighborhoods.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.720]   This is not going to be on highways.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:39.280]   They've been sell, they've been doing about 10,000 miles a week, a million autonomous
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:45.360]   miles on the road, 10,000 autonomous miles a week.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:50.240]   So it's, it's, it's going to be a self-driving golf car, isn't it?
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   It looks like that.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   I want a real car.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.240]   I like that.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.100]   It's, it's about the same speed and power as those and it may actually therefore be
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.100]   legal in those terms.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.100]   Oh, maybe it is.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.100]   Maybe it is.
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.120]   Maybe one of the reasons it's that shape.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.040]   But it's so cute.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.760]   There's no human in that one.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:11.680]   It's also looks less resistant to being crashed into by a brand of passers by than the previous
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.920]   Priuses.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:20.440]   There have been, since September 4 accidents, but in every case, Google says they were low
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:26.000]   speed under 10 miles an hour and it was the humans fault, not the drivers fault or the
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.200]   cars fault.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:34.960]   So I just put a, and then the rundown of Chris Saka, just Saka, Saka, Saka, Saka, Saka,
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   Cowboy Sherboy.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   Saka.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.880]   Is it doing an AMA in periscope?
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.880]   And I got lucky.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.920]   You know, there was, I had a friend, James Cham, who, who at the time was at that time.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   So bored of his stuff.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.920]   I know I'm too.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.440]   Shouldn't it be sideways?
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.960]   I mean, doesn't it?
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.720]   You could turn it sideways, I think.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:03.080]   But we asked Ben Rubin, the founder of Mirkat, why Mirkat, when it first came out, forced
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.320]   you really to do portrait money, said, because that's native to the phone.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.320]   If you're watching it on the phone, then just on the phone, it makes sense.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   It's one of those.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.640]   And it only looks bad on a desktop when you go, why am I looking through a, especially
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.400]   what this particular shot where Saka's half cut off.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.400]   It's a two shot.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   I can't get both the faces in it.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.480]   It's a one and a half shot.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.640]   They should, they should like lean in from opposite sides of the frame like that.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.880]   Oh, I think, I mean, this, this is the eternal problem of TV, which is like, what shape should
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   it be?
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.880]   Not that shape.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.080]   Somebody says your eyes, you have two eyes.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.040]   It should be, it's a turn that on its side.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.800]   So you can use your two eyes.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.240]   I think when you're looking at a phone, that makes perfect sense to me.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.240]   I don't have any problem with that.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.560]   But that, but it doesn't work for this particular thing.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.680]   So why should we care that Saka's doing a periscope?
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.840]   Is there some excitement?
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.840]   Nah.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:00.480]   Are you a, you know what they did periscope?
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.320]   The Spotify announcement this morning, the Spotify announcement was not streamed publicly
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.880]   in New York.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:12.120]   Press were invited and Mashable, I think, or fast company decided to periscope it.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.280]   Oh, interesting.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.880]   Huh?
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:20.840]   Spotify announced that they are going to do an updated app.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.600]   This is, you know what's happening here is everybody, this is anything happened before
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.960]   the watch came, the Apple watch came out.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:32.600]   Everybody is trying to get their bit of the news cycle before Apple announces its streaming
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.520]   music service in June at WWDC.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:42.040]   So Spotify is going to do video, which is a big, big deal.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.640]   And they are also going to feature podcasts, including ours.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.680]   Oh, so this show and all of the Twitter programs will be available.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.880]   Audio and video on Spotify.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   I'll be very interested.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.880]   That's really interesting.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.640]   So they cost you their hosting it?
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   No, no.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.640]   Any revenue.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.640]   I don't know what the deal is.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   We might get revenue.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.640]   I don't know.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   I don't think so because they're not modifying.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.920]   They're not putting ads in it or anything.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.240]   They don't do ads, but they don't do it.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:13.280]   How far are they taking our ads out though?
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.440]   So they also announced a new feature, which I really like.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.640]   If you're a runner, they'll automatically make a playlist that matches your cadence
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.240]   as you run because the phone knows your...
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.840]   Oh, Jesus, I'll get a funeral dirge.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:31.720]   Well, just your dog running right.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.360]   He said it's like dancing.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.360]   You don't want it.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   You wouldn't dance to music.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.360]   They didn't match.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.560]   You wouldn't dance one way and have the music be different.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.480]   So that makes sense.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.160]   So yeah, we're thrilled to be part of that.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.400]   We knew about it because we had to provide them with content and make sure it worked
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.000]   and all that stuff.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.640]   So if you're a Spotify subscriber, good news, along with all the great music, you'll be able
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.120]   to listen to "Twit" or "Twig" this show.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   "Twig."
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.920]   Please twig.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:14.560]   Russia threatens to ban Google and Twitter and Facebook over extremist content.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:20.960]   There is a move of foot, not just in Russia, look at Great Britain, to mark some of the
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:26.480]   some kinds of speech, so threatening that it's going to be blocked.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.400]   I hope we don't get to that situation.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.400]   I'm not afraid.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:36.080]   But it's also, I think, just the nearest excuse to try to ban these things that threaten
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.800]   tyrants.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.000]   Well that's really the real reason.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.040]   They want to ban, Russia says, over extremist content, illegal activities.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:52.760]   It's that bloggers law that they passed.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.120]   The 2014 legislation requires popular bloggers in Russia to register their real identity with
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.360]   the authorities.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.720]   Well they have to do that a while ago, right?
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.800]   Right, that was last year.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   So they're going to use that, though, to also regulate social media.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.480]   And of course, David Cameron, we talked about this last week, said, "Great Britain."
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:19.280]   Very depressing.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:24.800]   Well, it was actually such a depressing quote because it sounded like 1984.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.520]   I can't believe that he said that.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.520]   It was shocking.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.520]   He said, "I've got to..."
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:33.120]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.960]   Yeah, because I want to...
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.160]   Up to now we've said that as long as you obey the law, we won't bully you, but that's
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.160]   got to change.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   It was literally...
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:49.840]   It was a passively tolerance society for too long.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.280]   For too long we've been a passively tolerant society saying to our citizens, "As long as
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.400]   you obey the law, we'll leave you alone."
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.640]   Is this Putin or Cameron?
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   It's hard to tell.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.640]   This is David Cameron.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.080]   It's David Cameron, which is...
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.520]   Sure.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.880]   This government will conclusively turn the page on this failed approach as the party of
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:14.160]   one nation we will govern as one nation and bring our country together.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.960]   This sounds like nationalism to the extreme.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.360]   Well, one nation has a different nuance in the UK, but it does sound like...
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.360]   Oh, it does?
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.360]   Okay.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.320]   Well, there's a notion of one nation tourism which, as opposed to divisions between rich
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.320]   and poor.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.320]   Oh.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.320]   So that's what he's drawing on there.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.560]   But yeah, from the outside it does sound like Ayn Reich, which is...
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.560]   Ayn Reich?
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.560]   Ayn Volk?
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.280]   And if you say anything against us, well, that's your problem.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   Wow.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.040]   But it is a...
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.440]   It is a really, really bad departure.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.760]   And the Open Rights Group in the UK is sort of wrapping up working on how to deal with
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.920]   this and seeing how they can respond.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.400]   What is the reaction in the UK?
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.720]   I'm not in the UK, so only see what I see through social media.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.480]   But it was widely heralded as a shocking thing.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.480]   Yeah, good.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:15.360]   So the other half of it is that it is also a shout out to the law and order wing of his
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.640]   party and the UKIP crowd as well.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.520]   That's the other piece of this.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.520]   And it is a...
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.040]   Yeah, that's kind of...
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:26.960]   To me, it sounds like the UKIP rhetoric, the very highly nationalistic rhetoric.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:33.520]   Well, that UKIP was very, very shocking for the Conservatives because they won the majority,
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.360]   but they won the most seats in the European Parliament last year because the European
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   Parliament is done by the...
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.240]   They got one seat in the selection.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.480]   Partyless PR, whereas the election is done by First Task Post.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.480]   But it didn't...
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.960]   They got one seat, yes, but they got five million votes or something.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.840]   So they did affect a lot of results by moving votes around, which is the way things work
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.000]   in the UK.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.960]   And it worked out in the Conservatives' favour mostly, I think, because they managed to
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.760]   persuade some of their UKIP types to swing back to them, rather than vote Labour.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.000]   But it was...
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.280]   It was a shock result.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.000]   The pollsters had no idea what was going on because of all these different parties and
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.160]   their model of left-right didn't fit anymore.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.800]   But it was also this sort of...
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.600]   There is now this sort of...
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:26.520]   UKIP has moved the rhetoric such that there is this very, very strong anti-immigration turn,
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:32.320]   anti-immigration policy, which sounds very un-British to me.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.160]   But then I've been away for a while, so it's all committed to...
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.040]   It feels like nationalism is growing.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.640]   And nationalism in Europe has always been a problem.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.800]   It's a history.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:45.080]   There's a bad history.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:50.280]   Google wants to put buy buttons on its search result pages in the coming weeks.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.640]   This is a slap at Amazon, isn't it?
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.760]   Yeah, it's like a one-click.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.760]   Google says...
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.760]   Well, Google doesn't say anything.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.760]   But the idea is that the buttons, when you do a search...
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.760]   Again, on mobile.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.760]   It's mobile.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:08.600]   Well, a company sponsored search results or paid search results.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.240]   You might see, according to this article, a shop on Google heading at the top of the
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.240]   page, the button, though, will not drive you to Google, but drive you to the sponsor,
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.240]   to the advertising map.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.120]   Which will still have Europe, it will preserve, because that's been the essence of the fight.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.120]   That is the essence of the antitrust.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   Is Google shopping?
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.200]   So it's Google putting a bit of a poke in the eye.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.400]   No, I'm fine with that.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:33.360]   Google won't show buy buttons when shoppers search on desktop computers.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.360]   Just...
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.360]   Why not?
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.360]   On mobile.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:40.160]   You know, I think they figure it doesn't matter on desktop, where they're really facing
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.920]   the battle is in mobile search, right?
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.840]   But if it's a user...
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:49.520]   I don't think that it's still the same user, and treat me as a user appropriately across
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.680]   all platforms.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.600]   What's good for the mobile is good for the game.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.280]   Yeah, just a little step.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.760]   That's a good point.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.080]   And it's kind of an inconsistent user experience that way.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.080]   Right.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.280]   And I don't mind a buy button.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.880]   I mean, it's already an ad.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.800]   All it's doing is giving me a way to act upon the...
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   But here's what will happen.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.760]   Oh, Google's promoting its advertisers over neutral listings of shopping services.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.760]   Yeah, it is.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.760]   It's called capitalism.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.600]   But I don't think they're going to complain, because it's in paid advertising.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   Not in central sources.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.960]   But that was the same problem as the Google's promoting its paid advertisers.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.160]   That's the essence of the suit.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.280]   Of the investigation.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.480]   Where do you guys come down on...
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.480]   What?
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.480]   What?
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.480]   What?
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.480]   What?
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   Is this a...
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.480]   I missed the presidential lawsuit by that.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.160]   There's not a lawsuit.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.000]   There was proposed action by the EU.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.280]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   They investigate.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   Oh, is the antitrust?
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.280]   Is the antitrust actually?
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.280]   Exactly.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.280]   So, they're going out for them.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.160]   They'll charge them 6% of their revenue.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.000]   You didn't hear about that one?
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.800]   That's a good one.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.560]   Might help pay off Greece's debt.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.480]   Probably would.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.560]   Internet.org and the EFF.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.960]   We talked last week about Zuckerberg.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.600]   You're going to Facebook on Tuesday.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:17.160]   You can ask Mark about this.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:23.480]   Internet.org is not just Facebook, but others proposing a way to bring the Internet to under
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:29.680]   undeveloped nations with the support of Facebook and others, and it would give them
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:35.200]   kind of a special version of the Internet.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:39.440]   Remember, Mark Zuckerberg addressed this notion that it wasn't net neutral.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.280]   EFF now has published an article.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.040]   Internet.org is not neutral, not secure.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.040]   That's a new argument.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.800]   And not the Internet.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:56.480]   Internet.org offers people from developing countries free mobile access to selected websites
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.880]   and has been pitched as a philanthropic initiative to connect two-thirds of the world who don't
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.160]   yet have Internet access.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:07.480]   The EFF says we agree that global digital divide should be closed, but is this the right
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.880]   way to do it?
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.960]   So what is the right way to do it?
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.680]   That's not going to be his point, is that you can't give away the whole Internet for
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.680]   free.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.280]   That's just not going to work.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.800]   There are commercial interests here.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.320]   They opened it up to more than Facebook.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.080]   The original one was going to be Facebook for free.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.600]   Well, Facebook and Wikipedia.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   Wikipedia was the thing.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   Wikipedia, that's right.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   That's right.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.600]   Well done.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   Get all that in.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.600]   Knock your Wikipedia stuff.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.880]   You see, you got Wikipedia.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.360]   Now if they did the WikiLeaks, then I'd be impressed.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.040]   And so they opened up to more.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.680]   And so what do you prefer?
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:51.040]   I certainly get the argument on neutrality, but does the fundamentalism go too far if it
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.040]   prevents something here?
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.040]   I think that this is, I'm not going to, we're going to have to do it again, but this is
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.520]   kind of the argument I had with Matthew Wringham.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.680]   Is it when you say, "Well, I just don't like that.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.680]   Stop.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.120]   Take a deep breath and say, 'Well, what are the terms that might make you like it?
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:11.560]   What are the principles that you would expect Facebook to accede to that would make this
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.560]   acceptable to bring free internet to a lot more people?
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.680]   Are there any other circumstances in which you could imagine that happening?
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.440]   That's the conversation we ought to have.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.200]   And I think it's something about Facebook being open to other services, which they're
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.200]   doing.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.200]   I don't know what the limitations are.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.200]   Is it too limited?
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.960]   You know, let's get into the arguments.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:34.440]   Or are you just saying that no, Facebook cannot give away free internet access full stop?
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.720]   Well, but get ready for this.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.880]   You can debate that and maybe reasonable people can.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.880]   Get this.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.160]   Unreasonable, so that's long to be.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.240]   No, I'm on your side on that one.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.560]   But maybe you can make an argument, "Hey, better that than nothing."
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:54.760]   But internet.org prevents encrypted HTTPS connections.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.600]   It's a proxy server.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.160]   Traffic must pass through.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:04.760]   And some devices like Android phones that have the technical ability to make encrypted
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:10.440]   connections through the proxy server will be prevented from doing that.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.840]   Android app can automatically bring up the interstitial warning directly on the phone
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.360]   by using the app to analyze links.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:23.080]   And more importantly, traffic must pass for phones.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:27.080]   Okay, the most inexpensive feature phones that can't run an Android app don't support
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.960]   phone-based warnings that would say, "Hey, this is not a safe connection.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.880]   It's not encrypted."
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.160]   For these phones, traffic must pass through internet.org's proxy unencrypted, which means
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:42.360]   any information users send or receive from internet.org services can be read by local
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.640]   police or national intelligence agencies.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.560]   What do you imagine the rationale for that is?
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.520]   It's because these are low-end phones.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:51.520]   I'm not sure of what the...
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.120]   It's also because it's very hard to proxy HTTP.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.960]   Yes, because it's a point of HTTP.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.960]   Right.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.960]   Yes.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.120]   Because in order to proxy, you have to man in the middle.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.920]   Whereas you can proxy HTTP because it's in plaintext.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.600]   And so Kevin, you have to proxy this because that's the only way to make it free because
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:09.160]   it's a free connection to versus a paid connection.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.960]   I think it's a rewriting proxy.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.560]   I think that's my understanding of it.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.560]   Here's a deal.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   Transforming the pages.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.760]   Let me read this.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.640]   Compliance, blah, blah, blah, with the guide announcement, will be reviewed by internet.org
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.400]   team, which make the site available.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:30.280]   There's a compliance standard, guidelines.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:34.880]   Any website operator could submit their site for inclusion in internet.org provided it
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.920]   meets the guidelines.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:42.320]   Those guidelines are neutralized to subject matter, but do impose technical limitations
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:47.360]   intended to ensure the sites don't overly burden the carrier's network and that they'll
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:54.280]   work on inexpensive feature phones as well as modern smartphones.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:58.320]   The site will have to be then routed through the internet.org proxy server, which allows
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:04.320]   the sites to be zero rated by "participating mobile phone operators," allows the automatic
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.480]   stripping out of content that violates the guidelines.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.840]   That includes images bigger than a megabyte, videos, VoIP calls.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.360]   That's why it has to go through the proxy so we can do that filtering.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:20.160]   It's going to strip out flash, Java applets, even JavaScript, and inserts an interstitial
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.800]   warning for user attempts to leave internet.org's zero rated portion of the internet.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.240]   In other words, you've got this for free, but if you leave this, you're going to be billed
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   for data charges.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:34.240]   You still have access, in some cases, to a broader internet, but you'll get billed for
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.320]   that whereas internet.org is free.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.440]   To some extent, do you remember the Google proxy?
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.440]   Google.com/twt/n.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:49.360]   That was an old one they wrote a few years back for when mobile browsers were really
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:55.880]   crap, and it takes your web pages and strips them down into a nice lean version.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:03.080]   It does a fairly good job of making sense of the pages, but it will rewrite the HTML.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.120]   It will dump out the starting and the scripts.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.720]   It will make smaller versions of the image and do that sort of thing.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:15.440]   It's a way of getting some kind of rendition of the page on a mobile connection.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:21.880]   So there, that always doing something similar to that, and to some extent, the new Facebook
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.040]   instant pages thing is doing something similar to that.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:29.760]   It's reading the HTML and rendering it a different way.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.320]   You can argue this in different directions.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:37.760]   You can say a re-running proxy can be a useful thing because to some extent, readability
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.640]   is that some of the reader type apps do that.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.000]   They make a more stripped-down version of the page.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.800]   It's easy for you to make sense of.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:53.760]   But it's stripping out things that the app these sending site put there for a reason.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.960]   But in the other sense, that is kind of the spirit of the web.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:01.560]   The spirit of the web is you declare a bunch of stuff and then the browser makes a choice
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.680]   about which part of it to render to you.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:09.560]   So that is doing that as an answer is one way of doing it.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.360]   But obviously, if you're still done doing the whole thing and then deciding which bits
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:18.440]   to display, you're still creating a lot of data transmission to do that.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:22.320]   So they're basically doing that in between and sending something different through.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:28.680]   And the question there is how does that affect the web in between?
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.240]   So there is some nuance here because there's obviously value.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.320]   You don't want to outlaw sites that transform other sites.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.320]   That will be a bad idea.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.360]   So it's like this Google proxy or some of the indie web tools that we have that do feed
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.640]   reading off HTML page, things like that.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:54.360]   But there is a challenge when this is being sold as this is the internet to people who
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.520]   don't have much alternative.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.120]   It's like, oh, Facebook works great, but everything else works in some slightly damaged
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.160]   way is a bit problematic.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.680]   EFF concludes, while we applaud Facebook's efforts to encourage more websites to provide
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:11.280]   support for low-end feature phones by stripping out heavy content, that would be the right
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:16.720]   way to do it, by the way, is to put the burden on the site to offer a special version.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:21.120]   We would like to see internet.org try harder to achieve its very worthy objective of connecting
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.360]   the remaining through thirds of the world of the internet.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:28.480]   We have confidence it would be possible to provide a limited free internet access service
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.480]   that is secure.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.480]   Oh, OK.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.480]   So here's the principles.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.480]   OK, good.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:39.080]   Don't rely on Facebook and its partners to maintain a central list of approved sites.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.080]   That's the set.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.080]   You know, there's two things.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:46.280]   It's insecure, but also Facebook's a gatekeeper until then internet.org will not be living
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.480]   up to its promise or its name.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:52.080]   Well, this is the case where it won't be hell.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.680]   Oh, that's been eaten.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.680]   Whoa.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:59.280]   And all the notes, the birds have gone quiet as well.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:04.480]   I got this accredited down there quick.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:10.760]   So I think that what I does internet.org have an independent board.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.760]   I don't know.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.520]   But that's why I sort of long argued.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:19.200]   We have discussions about Google and cases where, you know, they knock off a shopping
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.800]   site because they think it's spam and the shopping site argues there ought to be a jury
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.200]   appears an independent jury.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.800]   Same here, you know, then fine.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.640]   They have a board that makes independent decisions based on principles.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.400]   What is it that makes free internet for the world okay and acceptable?
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.560]   Which I'm, you know, they're starting to answer that.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.720]   How do you do you feel good?
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.960]   How do you like dubstep?
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:45.600]   Apparently, no, I was quite a transition.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:50.760]   I mean, these two topics are so close to each other.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.440]   So I'm changing this subject.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.920]   I'm changing the subject.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.000]   Google, kind of dubstep.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.200]   No, I'm just moving on.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.200]   Vasistas.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.280]   Vasistas dubstep.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   So you know who Skrilix is?
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.480]   Oh, because the Skrilix side of it.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.480]   Yeah, it's okay.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.480]   Yeah, I was put that into it.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.480]   It's funny.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.480]   I love it.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:14.840]   This is the Google store store.google.com where they sell Nexus phones and Nexus tablets.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.360]   Now has a limited edition Skrilix live case.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.520]   Ask Jake about it.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.920]   Jake will know.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.000]   It's got special companion wallpaper.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   The view from Skrilix's satellite.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.840]   I don't know what the Skrilix has his own satellite.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.840]   It's pretty cool.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.680]   It has NFC built into the case.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:36.120]   So the phone knows which case it has on.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.120]   And then reacts.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.680]   Each Skrilix live case is in it.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.680]   I got to get this.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.680]   I'm not a Skrilix fan.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.680]   My son is.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.320]   40 bucks.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.760]   Each Skrilix live case is individually numbered and comes with built-in smarts.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:52.200]   A customizable shortcut button on the back there is that's that button gives you one
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.400]   touch access to your favorite stuff.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.240]   It's like a like like a built-in pressy.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.240]   Remember pressy that kick started?
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.200]   You could set it to launch the phone's camera open any of your apps.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.920]   Of course go to Skrilix's site which I bet you is the default.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.040]   When they do a yo-yo ma case.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.560]   That's what I'm going to buy one.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.760]   This is for the Nexus 5.6 Galaxy S5 Samsung Galaxy S6.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   Ah!
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.320]   And note 4.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.200]   I'm going to order it right away.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.200]   And I'll demonstrate it when it comes in.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.800]   There are three different companies.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.760]   Space Shield Circuit Bay and Planet.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.560]   Or those are the three different styles.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.240]   Which one should I?
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   What's Circuit Bay?
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.240]   Ooh.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:45.200]   And I saw it because Google retweeted the Google Store Twitter account.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:48.000]   Which one, uh, whichever one should I get?
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   Skrilix Live Space Shield Circuit Bay or Planet.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Let's see Planet.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.360]   Do you think my son will have more respect for me if I get one of these cases?
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.160]   No, he'll say that.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.440]   I'm not sure.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.360]   I'm leaning towards the Space Shield.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.560]   He'll say Skrilix is so overdone.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.200]   Skrilix is like 2010.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.200]   Come on, Dad.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.400]   He is kind of, isn't he?
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:21.280]   Who does he like now?
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.720]   I can't remember.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.720]   All right.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.720]   Dead mouse.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.720]   I'll go on.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   Ask Andrew.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.720]   Who's the...
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:35.720]   He's in Florence at the moment.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.720]   Easy.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.720]   How nice for him.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   He was funding.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:46.920]   Oh, and here's an article from Wired Magazine on how it works.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:48.920]   Google and Skrilix.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   I like the question.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.920]   All right.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.920]   All right.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.920]   That is...
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   I think that's editorial.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   Why now?
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.920]   Oh, man, these takeovers.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   Okay, here.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:58.920]   All right.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.760]   You know the new thing they do with takeovers is they move the close button around.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:06.360]   So you have to like really look at the ad to figure out where you get rid of it.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.760]   Oh, I know it's so awful.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:08.760]   They hide it.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.760]   They move it around.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.760]   We got rid of pop-ups.
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:13.200]   We got rid of pop-ups in their back.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.560]   It keeps you guessing for at least like three seconds so that they can register you as a
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.560]   view, right?
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.560]   Exactly.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.560]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.560]   Where's the X?
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.560]   Yep.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.560]   It's a new game.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.560]   Oh, Skrilix designed these himself.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.880]   What a surprise.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:29.120]   His real name is Sunnymore.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.320]   Phone cases are supposed to be fun, you know.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.680]   Baron of Bangorang.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.480]   I really like the really crazy phone cases that are out right now.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.480]   You see the...
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.480]   I don't know if he's British.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.480]   I don't know where he's from.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.400]   He did like 20 designs.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.960]   His favorite was quote, like Windows 95.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:51.720]   It was a super vaporware one.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:58.560]   He's not even speaking, making sense.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.560]   He is a DJ.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.120]   Is he a DJ or what is he?
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.120]   Yes.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.120]   He's a DJ and producer.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.120]   He makes music.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.120]   He's a producer.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.120]   He makes music.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.120]   He said mix it.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.120]   I'm proud to tell anybody this.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.880]   I had this really crazy dream when I was really young.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.880]   I was in my house.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.880]   Oh, Lord.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   I'm in my room.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:13.880]   This is the dream.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.880]   And I wake up in the dream and I look out my window and this blue light flies into my
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.880]   backyard.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:23.080]   And moments later, these two aliens open the door to my room.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.600]   The dumpling of America.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.560]   Covering my face on the covers and walking them and just looking at them like so frightened
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.240]   and so afraid and it was so real.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.480]   And then they just sort of like walked around me and like stared at me and then left the
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.480]   room.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:36.480]   Why do you think this is a dream?
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.480]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:38.480]   That's a real dream though.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   That's a real dream.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.480]   I'm so real in the dream.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.480]   I'm fascinated.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.480]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.480]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:44.480]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.680]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.680]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:52.680]   Google hopes this is a model for other artists and creators, more edition partners coming.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.680]   Okay.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.680]   Okay.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:56:00.580]   Somebody at Google probably Larry Page really likes Skrillex.
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:05.380]   There has been a rumor floating around for a few months now and Andrew Police has kind
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:10.880]   of been all over it about customizable cases.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.680]   So I don't know if this ties into that.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:18.960]   And one of the rumors actually is using Google Maps to create totally custom cases for Nexus
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.120]   devices and stuff.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.240]   So, you know, who knows?
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:25.680]   Maybe this is something that we're going to hear more about at I/O kind of a broadening
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:26.680]   of this.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:27.880]   This is like a little teaser and then we get to I/O.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.440]   You remember, you know, what we just did with Skrillex?
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:33.280]   Now you can do it with Google Maps or whatever.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.800]   How would you use what?
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.800]   What do you do?
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.880]   Put on different cases based on your mood.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:40.880]   Yes.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.880]   Buy more cases.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:42.880]   Apparently.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:43.880]   I don't get it.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:44.880]   This is, I put, I kickstarted it.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.280]   I put some money in this one.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   I'm a backer.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.880]   I pledged 109 bucks for the next pack.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.520]   Didn't we talk about this on the show?
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.880]   The first truly modular smartphone case.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:54.880]   Yeah, we did.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:56.880]   See?
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.880]   All the little bits and pieces.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.880]   I'll be trailing bits of my phone cases as I walk around.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.880]   We'll prepare you for Project ARA when you get that.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:06.880]   It's kind of just a warm up.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   Yep.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.880]   So what did I get?
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:10.880]   109 bucks.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.880]   Oh, here it is.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.640]   Special Edition Magenta Next Pack and four modules.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:24.320]   So the modules you could have an SD card reader, an amplified speaker, a flashlight, more power,
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:28.440]   temperature and humidity sensor, hot keys, USB flash.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.640]   See, this is better than Skrillex.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:37.520]   There's an air quality sensor, a breathalyzer, a laser.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:42.440]   There's a backup drive and a dummy slot.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.400]   My luck, I'll get two dummy slots.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.280]   I don't know.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   I guess they're funded.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.280]   Look at this.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.280]   They wanted $50,000.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.880]   They got $200,000 and still have nine days to go.
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:53.880]   Next pack.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.520]   Thanks to Schmucks like you.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.320]   Thanks to Schmucks.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:01.320]   You know, I every once in a while like to go back and look at all the Kickstarter projects.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.320]   I know.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:06.200]   That I've backed and never got anything from.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   Just a reminder of what a true sucker I am.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.240]   It's like, ah.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:16.680]   So did you see the $9 computer one chip?
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.160]   Is that a Kickstarter?
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.440]   That's a Kickstarter.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.840]   It's called clip, I think.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:22.840]   Chip.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:23.840]   Chip, that's it.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.080]   I just put the link in the.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:29.560]   Yeah, we tried to get them up, but they were for last week for the new screen savers, but
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.960]   they were they were busy.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.480]   So it's a $9 computer.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.040]   They've raised $1.5 million.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.040]   $9 at a time.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.760]   28,848 backers.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.720]   So it's like a Raspberry Pi, right?
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.720]   It's the first $9 computer.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.240]   It's a cheaper, cheaper Raspberry Pi.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.640]   VGA or HDMI.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.440]   Chip does computer things.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.200]   Save your documents to chips onboard storage.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.480]   Lift the web over a Wi-Fi.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.760]   Play games with Bluetooth controllers.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.760]   But wait.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:06.360]   If a $9 computer could do this, what do we need Project Internet.org for?
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:07.840]   It makes chip portable.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.840]   Take chip.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.840]   It's a connectivity.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:10.840]   And you can use chip.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.840]   It's kind of tippy.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:13.880]   It's a tough part, isn't it?
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:14.880]   You might have noticed.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.880]   Is this kind of weird?
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.880]   Is this different?
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.640]   I think the main of the cable, isn't it?
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:19.640]   Right.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:20.640]   Like, I think it's in your projects.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:25.800]   And we're so excited to see what you can do with a $9 computer.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.360]   Kickstarter, we need your help.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.520]   We're going to have them on this week.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.280]   This week, they're going to be on this right now.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.280]   That's what Jerry just confirmed.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.280]   Good.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.280]   Watch Saturday.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.280]   Make the $9 computer reality.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.280]   They're coming up.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.800]   And back chip on Kickstarter today.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.000]   They still have 16 days ago.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.720]   It's not too late.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:44.120]   I doubt there's any $9 pledges left.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.400]   Nope, those are gone.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.880]   Well, yep, there are.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:50.880]   There's still some.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.360]   You get a make your very own $9 computer.
[00:59:53.360 --> 01:00:00.000]   It was a chip and a composite cable for maximum bare bones enjoyment.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   That's cool.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.640]   Yeah, we'll find out what's going on with that.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:09.560]   Let's take another break, I guess.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.680]   Why don't you guys look through the rundown and see if there's anything you're interested
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.680]   in.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.680]   Sure.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:23.200]   While I talk about something I'm interested in, legalzoom.com, are you the next world
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.200]   famous entrepreneur?
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.760]   Maybe it's not fame you're looking for.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.720]   You just want to help people.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.800]   Whatever your motivation, if you're an innovator, it is easier than ever to launch your dream.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.760]   You know that.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.560]   Legalzoom's here to help you incorporate a form an LLC to start your business.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.560]   That's what we did.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.560]   LLC.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.400]   Register those trademarks to protect your products and services.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.040]   We also did that.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.320]   Apply for a patent to secure your invention.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.880]   You could do that too.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.040]   For a lot less than you'd think.

[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.480]   They're not a law firm.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.200]   I want to be clear about this.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:21.720]   But you can get advice from Legalzoom's network of independent attorneys in most states.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.880]   You choose the attorney based on their profile, but on it it reviews as well on Legalzoom.com.

[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:04.680]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.720]   Weird.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:13.840]   We talked about this on security now on yesterday.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:19.120]   Legal operators in Europe are saying we're going to block online advertising.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.480]   Kind of adblock for you.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.120]   Talk about net unnatural.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:33.160]   Well, you know, the examples they give are a little scary of free games that are ad supported
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.640]   and they just take the ad right out.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.800]   You didn't really want that, did you?
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.480]   So what's the story here?
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.920]   This is, again, this is Europe as comes to stories from financial times.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.920]   It's a report.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.920]   It's sources.
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.720]   You know, who knows?
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.400]   Although the financial time says one European wireless carrier has already installed the
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.920]   blocking software and its data setters and plans to turn it on before the end of the
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.120]   year comes from an Israeli startup called Shine.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.200]   I mean, the details are pretty good here.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.720]   Tens of millions of mobile subscribers around the world will be opting into adblock by the
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.640]   end of the year said the chief marketing officer of Shine.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:18.800]   If this scales, it could have a devastating impact on the online advertising industry.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.520]   And he says that with a smile.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.960]   And every site supported by advertising.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.880]   Well, that's what worries me a little bit.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:34.200]   It wouldn't affect us, but the video that they show, let me see if I can find this technology,
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.760]   shows them just stripping the ads out of stuff.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:44.320]   So this is like the next toxic version of the internet at all problem of putting proxies
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.320]   in the middle of Europe.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.320]   Right.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.320]   Yeah, it is.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.320]   It is.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.360]   And some of the carriers have done this, this kind of thing.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.680]   I think they've done ad injection rather, ad stripping.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.160]   Yeah, they put ads in.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.160]   One of the Canadian ones did, didn't they?
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.160]   Was that really cool?
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160]   Yep.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.160]   Yeah, it was one long ago.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.800]   There was one 10 years ago, I think I mentioned the show before that we fought it kind of
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:08.480]   asked along with other big publishers in one in the United States.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.080]   You couldn't take over our page and do something to it with a browser add on.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.600]   Shine says eliminating intrusive ads is a consumer right.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.320]   Even if it undermines the business model of online publishers that rely on advertising.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.000]   Online advertising is out of control and it's polluting the user's experience.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   Oh, how marvelous.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.160]   Well, I'm not completely unsympathetic.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.680]   It can be annoying.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:37.120]   You were just talking about pop ups and the Xs and well, the equivalent would be if your
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:40.000]   cable system cut off the air.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   That's for you.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.520]   You didn't have to fast forward just to pull that.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:43.520]   That's a good point.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.520]   Yeah, we had that.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.520]   It was called Tivo.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.240]   You got to do it though.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:51.160]   Well, that but they had a version that would actually like find the ads and skip them and
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.720]   then they're like, yeah, no, you're going to be shut down if you do that.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.200]   So they then they had the 30 second skip forward button and then took that out too.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.360]   Let's see if I can find this.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.640]   Yes, you have to fast forward them.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:14.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.

[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:52.640]   I'm not sure if I can find it.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:12:00.640]   We could also learn from Google that plain text ads don't bother people as much.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.640]   - And relevant ads.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:11.640]   Oculus has sent out invites, I think we have one somewhere lying around.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.640]   For a special event, June 11th, we're trying to decide should we cover this?
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.640]   What's it going to be?
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.640]   Facebook owns the Oculus Rift.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.640]   It's not going to be the announcement of an actual product or what?
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:29.640]   Stepping to the Rift is what the invite says.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:36.640]   - At the same time, above Google moved ahead of search design to cardboard.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:41.640]   - There's a VR war on Cleveland.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   - Do you think I bet you, I actually predicted this on Sunday, we'll see at Google I/O.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.640]   We'll see some AR, I think.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.640]   - I'll show you will.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.640]   - Not VR, but AR.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.640]   I'm curious what's going on here.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.640]   Maybe you could pre-order this.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.640]   - Just to be sure here, is cardboard just AR or is it also VR?
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.640]   - Card was VR only.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.640]   - Google does have some AR technology.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.640]   - We also might see more VR then.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.640]   - I personally am not sold on the VR thing.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.640]   - I'm just having my Seymour.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.640]   - Oh yeah, Google's going to do VR too.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.640]   - Yeah, there's investment in cardboard.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.640]   - They shipped cardboard at the last Google line.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:35.640]   - And of course, I wish we could see sales numbers for the Galaxy Gear VR, but that's
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:40.640]   Samsung selling a cheap, it's only a couple hundred bucks because it's really just a
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.640]   plastic holder for your smartphone.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.640]   - Galaxy S5, you're not--
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:49.640]   - Oh, I actually said Note 4, and then there's an S6 one.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.640]   - Glass is not AR either, I should point out.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.640]   Glass has kind of-- it looked like glass might be a augmented reality, but it's not.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.640]   It's just a little screen over your eyebrow.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.640]   - Why is that not augmented reality?
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.640]   - Augmented reality.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.640]   - No, it's superimposed.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.640]   It's a heads up display.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.640]   It's augmenting reality.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.640]   I guess it depends what you--
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.640]   - Oh yeah, the direction, the--
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.640]   excuse me, the directions and saying, "No, turn left up there."
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.640]   - No, that's just putting your phone interface over your--
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.640]   - I know, but it's still AR.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.640]   - All right, Kevin, is it AR?
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.640]   - Is which AR?
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.640]   - Glass.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.640]   - Sorry.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.640]   - Um, not really.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:31.640]   I mean, it is, you know, it's AR in the same way that having a phone is AR, but it's not
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.640]   doing overlays.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.640]   - But you've seen-- we've all seen-- maybe we haven't, but the browser that you can run
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:40.640]   in your phone where you-- it uses the camera and it superimposes on top of the picture
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.640]   information about the businesses on the street.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.640]   That's to me what I think of as augmented reality, whereas your--
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.640]   and glasses would be even better.
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.640]   You're looking at something and more information is provided to your user interface or something
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:53.640]   like that.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.640]   I feel like glass is-- and that was kind of the disappointment for me.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.640]   I was hoping it was augmented reality, but as soon as we saw it, it was just really a little
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.640]   screen over your eyebrow.
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:03.640]   - Yeah, I mean, there are definitely-- there are definitely arguments about it, but that's--
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.640]   - Right.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.640]   - Moment.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   - Yeah.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:09.640]   - There's-- because if it's-- if the information that's coming up is the location
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:14.640]   aware and has some sense of what you're looking at, even if it isn't trying to do an actual
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.640]   realistic overlay, that's still potentially useful.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.640]   You know, that's like the terminator view where it puts up little captions on things.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:28.640]   You can imagine that as a form of AR that is more practical than I'm going to replace
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.640]   other people's faces with masks and things or those kinds of ideas.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:37.640]   But you could do like superimposed name tags on people.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.640]   - Yeah.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:43.640]   - Which is allegedly something Google built and then backed away from--
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.640]   - Oh, really?
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.640]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.640]   - That was-- - That was the definition to identity, yeah.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:53.640]   - But even more than that, what I'd love to know, you know, reputation score, email address,
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.640]   whatever, you know, that would be great.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:58.640]   So Google had that and thought, oh crap.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.640]   - Uh, creepy line.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.640]   - Creepy line.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.640]   - Creepy line.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.640]   - Mm.
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.640]   - The-- what was it, Kevin, you-- the-- the creepy and craft creepy line.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   - Creepy and craft creepy line.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.640]   [laughter]
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:13.640]   - Creepy craft is a different problem, but yeah, that's a--
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.640]   - I know, I just like the alliteration, that's all.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.640]   - Creepy line, yeah.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:23.640]   - Letter to the president from Google, Apple, and others, dear President Obama went out yesterday.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:29.640]   Washington Post obtained the letter, "We, the undersigned represent a wide variety of civil society organizations
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:34.640]   dedicated to protecting civil liberties, human rights, and innovation online, as well as technology companies,
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.640]   trade associations, and security and policy experts.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.640]   We are writing today to respond to recent statements by some administration officials regarding
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:49.640]   deployment of strong encryption technology and the devices and services offered by the US technology industry.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:57.640]   We urge you, it says, "enbold, to reject any proposal that US companies deliberately weaken security of their products.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:02.640]   We request the White House instead focus on developing policies that will promote, rather than undermine
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.640]   the wide adoption of strong encryption technology.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:10.640]   Such policies will in turn help to promote and protect cybersecurity, economic growth, and human rights,
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.640]   both here and abroad."
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   It's my guess that these signatories have some weight with particularly Google and Apple.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:31.640]   The bill of rights defense committee, the anti-Arab anti-discrimination committee, the center for democracy
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.640]   and technology is quite a little demand progress.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:39.640]   EFF, of course, EPIC, of course, the Free Software Foundation.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:43.640]   They actually got Richard Stalman to sign this, I guess.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:51.640]   The Gannom Foundation, Adobe, Apple, automatic, that's Matt Mullenweg's WordPress company.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:57.640]   Cisco, Coinbase, Cloudfair, Flair, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.640]   It's not what they're talking about.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.640]   It's a good list of people who know what they're talking about with software security.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.640]   Yeah, I would say Google.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.640]   Hewlett Packard.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.640]   I say, God bless Edward Snowden.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.640]   Micros, yeah, this whole conversation wouldn't even be going on.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:24.640]   Hal Abelson at MIT, Jacob Applebaum from the Torv Project, Steve Bellavan, one of the great security.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.640]   These are the top security researchers in the world.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.640]   Whitfield Diffie of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.640]   These are big names.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.640]   You don't get bigger names than this.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.640]   And they all agree.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.640]   Seems like it's a no-brainer.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.640]   It's not a heck of a list.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:52.640]   And then on the other side, you have the NSA, Bruce Schnire.
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.640]   Phil Zimmerman, creator of PGP.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:01.640]   So anyway, that letter went to the president yesterday.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.640]   See what happens.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.640]   Anything else you fellas?
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.640]   Oh, I know what I wanted to talk about.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.640]   Micropub, since we've got Kevin Marks on here.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.640]   Kevin's doing the work of the Angels, I think, with IndieWeb.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.640]   He's one of many, of course, it's not all him.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.640]   But at IndieWebCamp.com, you can find out more about the IndieWeb.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:26.640]   And he posed a question on his Twitter last week.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:35.640]   For you, Jeff, we were talking on the show last week about how medium incense people like you to put stuff there because of their interface.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:39.640]   It's such a pleasure to write.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:47.640]   And Kevin, you were saying, well, if that's all you want, we can give you that.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.640]   Well, that was the thing.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:57.640]   There was an IndieWeb camp in Dusseldorf last week because we've been doing them all different places.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:03.640]   And Aaron Parecki built a medium-like editor for Micropub.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:15.640]   Let me show Jeff what's cool about this is now I'm using known, we talked to Ben and Aaron on a show a while, maybe a year ago now, with known.com.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:30.640]   And so because known supports something called Micropub, which is a protocol that uses OAuth, I think it does, that allows me to authenticate with a Micropub endpoint, in this case, IndieWeb,
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:34.640]   I can just merely enter in my properly configured website.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.640]   And I'm going to do that at this Quill site.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:45.640]   And once I authenticate, and you see I can authenticate via Twitter, Google+ GitHub, that's because I've set that up or by phone.
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.640]   But let's just do Google+.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:48.640]   I usually use the phone.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.640]   It'll send me, it's really cool.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.640]   It'll send me, I can do that right now.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:55.640]   It'll send me a text message with a 4-digit code.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:21:00.640]   And when I enter in that 4-digit code, it'll authenticate, as it has.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:06.640]   And now I'm in Quill, but this is what Kevin wanted to show you, is the editor, the Quill Editor.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:07.640]   Let me launch this.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.640]   So you clicked on the editor thing at the bottom.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.640]   Yeah, I did.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:11.640]   But it's slow, hold on.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.640]   Now let's do it again.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.640]   Waiting, there we go.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.640]   This looks a little like medium, doesn't it, Jeff?
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   You know.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.640]   It looks a lot like medium.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.640]   It's based on a JavaScript, as I was cloned, of the media editor.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.640]   So Marker Word.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.640]   Watch this, you're going to love this.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.640]   There it is.
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.640]   Bold, italic, this is a link.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.640]   It automatically formats it all.
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.640]   H1, H2.
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:40.640]   No H3, that's it.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:45.640]   I could also do it in, as code, if I'm doing a code editor.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.640]   This is really nice.
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:49.640]   I really like it.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:54.640]   It's hidden this.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.640]   Yeah, can I drag images into it too?
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:00.640]   That's one thing medium does nicely.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:06.640]   And then, well here, let me, I'll just write a little posting from Quill.
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:11.640]   We're demoing this on Twig.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:15.640]   And I guess I should really make that a URL, shouldn't I?
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:21.640]   No, we'll do a little link here to http.slash.twit.tv/twig.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.640]   Check that and then publish it.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:29.640]   And clicking Publish Now will send a request to your micro pub end point.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:36.640]   So I'm doing this from my browser and from quill.p3k.io.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.640]   And it's posted.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:42.640]   And now if I go to my website, wow, magically, this is my known site.
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:49.640]   That post is there, which is really cool.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:56.640]   Aaron has also written a tool called Own Your Gram that will actually take things like this,
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:00.640]   which I posted on Instagram and copy it to my blog.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:06.640]   So the idea of all of this and the reason I strongly encourage Jeff to consider other choices is,
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:09.640]   and I realize that Jeff, your whole time you've been writing,
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:13.640]   your stuff has been in somebody else's hands.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.640]   No, not my, much of the time.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:21.640]   No, but even if you do, you've been writing for magazines and newspapers,
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:25.640]   you're used to the notion that stuff you write goes somewhere else.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:29.640]   And I'm such a, the whole, I think Kevin will support me on this idea,
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:35.640]   that the idea of IndieWeb is that it'd be great if you had your own website where all your stuff lived
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.640]   but was sitting in the house.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:41.640]   In addition to distributing worlds, that's the model I want for media is, is, is.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:42.640]   But Medium doesn't do that.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:43.640]   Put it on Facebook.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.640]   I'm saying, but the media in general.
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:50.640]   Media. Put it on Facebook. Put it on Twitter. Put it on Instagram. Put it everywhere. Fine.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:55.640]   But have your own home version of it, which is what these guys do, which is wonderful.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:58.640]   Quilted a nice job, by the way, of embedding your tweet, Kevin.
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.640]   I wasn't sure what would happen if I pasted the embed code and I knew exactly what to do, which is great.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:05.640]   Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's, it's also does image insertion.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.640]   It does.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.640]   Okay.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:16.640]   Which it does by data URLs, which is a, which is a wonderful bit of HTML voodoo, which means it can inject images directly into the HTML that it's sending over, which is, which is kind of fun.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:20.640]   The other thing that's cool about this is that you can comment on somebody else's blog.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:27.640]   If you have the URL and if it's blog is an IndieWeb, you know, micro pub supporting blog, it will, it's, it's, there's some nice stuff.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.640]   It's a indication of comments as well as content.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:33.640]   So the, the comments stuff that isn't micro pub that's web mention?
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.640]   Web mention, okay.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:41.640]   So the point of the, the IndieWeb stuff is we've, we've been in a lot of very, very focused, very small protocols for doing these different pieces.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:48.640]   So micro pub is micro pub uses indie or, which is the authorization thing you saw to say to prove that it's your site.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:49.640]   Right.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:25:00.640]   And it lets you post to your site, which means we can build a variety of tools that will let us post the sites, including this new quill editor, including, own your cram and so on.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:04.640]   And also mobile clients and whatever, but it's, it's a sort of general posting API.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.640]   Yes.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:12.640]   Because of course I can use knowns own, you know, mobile bookmark to post to it.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:22.640]   But, but this is another little IndieWeb project called mobile pub that gives, so this is an app that's on my Android device that when I post will post to my blog, which is kind of wild.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.640]   Yes.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:28.640]   But again, that's using the micro pub API and posting it from an app.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.640]   Right.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:32.640]   And I can even like this is what I really like.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:36.640]   So you want to do Facebook style likes if I have the URL that I'm liking, I can paste that in here.
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:42.640]   And this will actually syndicate to that blog, put a like up there, which is fantastic.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.640]   Yes.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:51.640]   So that's, and so that's the, the sort of, the point is that we're building enough of these protocols that we can start plugging them together and have this thing work.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.640]   And there was another thing I wanted to show you, which is, which is a new one.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.640]   Oh, good.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:58.640]   If you go to silo.pub.
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:25:59.640]   All right.
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:02.640]   S-I-L-O dot P-U-B.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.640]   Yep.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:11.640]   So the, the point of this is, this is a micro pub bridge that goes to certain hosted sites.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.640]   So Tumblr WordPress and Blogger, a blog, a hosted blogging site.
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.640]   This is WordPress.com, not WordPress at all.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:22.640]   And the problem is you can't necessarily install code on those.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:28.640]   So what this does is it gives you a way to add micro pub to these hosted sites.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.640]   Because they have an API.
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:37.640]   Because they have an API and you have to do a little bit of work, there's a little bit of setup work you have to do to put the right headers into the templates.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:45.640]   But it walks you through how to do that as well, which means you can then use these micro pub clients with these, these hosted services as well.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:48.640]   So you can use those elices or only a gram and so on with those.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.640]   So it's another sort of extension of this model.
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:27:00.640]   Again, this was one of these ideas where we were chatting about in the, in the IOC channel and Carl's, and I said, oh, it would be nice if we could do this.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.640]   And then Ryan said, well, this is how you could do this.
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:06.640]   And then Carl said, oh, I'll go and do that then and build this.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.640]   So, that's nice.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.640]   I love it.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.640]   I love it.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:13.640]   If you know how, if you know how to code, the world is your oyster.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:19.640]   Just stay up with web technologies.
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.640]   So many tries asking, how about media integration for this?
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.640]   Media doesn't have an API.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.640]   So much as much as web devices.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:31.640]   But when you cut and paste from text, it's very good.
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:32.640]   It picks up all the links.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:33.640]   It picks up everything.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:40.640]   No, it has, if you click on the thing on the right hand of media, there is an import post from URL thing or something like that.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:46.640]   And that you can then give it that the URL of the, the indie web posts, and it'll do a reasonable job of pulling it in.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.640]   Oh, that's good.
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:48.640]   Yes.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.640]   It's pretty, it's pretty damn impressive.
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:53.640]   But it would be nice to have a full API as opposed to.
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.640]   It'd be nice for you to do it directly.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:05.640]   But that's also be nice for, you know, medium, did announce this week that they're going to start letting you have medium hosts during your own domain, which is a step in the right direction.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   That's good.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.640]   They've only done it for a couple of big publishers.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.640]   They said they're going to let you do that.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.640]   So that's, that's encouraging.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:17.640]   But it's still, they're still hosting it and you don't get much control over markup and things.
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.640]   So you would, that would be a step towards the indie web idea.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:23.640]   And it was good to let people have control of their own domains.
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:29.640]   But the challenge is you wouldn't be able to plug in with this, because they haven't got the hooks that for us to do that.
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:33.640]   It is currently silly, difficult for most people to do this.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:37.640]   You have to do all sorts of little fiddly stuff.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:39.640]   And I guess it always will be a little bit.
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:42.640]   We'll try to work our ways to make it simpler.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.640]   So yeah, the.
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.640]   Hey, I could.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.640]   It's not that.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:55.640]   No, it's obviously one very great simplification because it gives you a standalone thing you can install or a hosted service that will let you get these indie web features.
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.640]   We're also encouraging people to integrate them into other systems.
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:28:59.640]   There's a series of WordPress plugins.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:04.640]   So if you've got a self hosted WordPress, you can install a set of indie web plugins and get these features.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:05.640]   So I think that might suit you, Jeff.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.640]   I think your does, does machine itself hosted, right?
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:16.640]   So I'm going to go to a meeting today at the Narrow Times from Pointer and the Knight Foundation on annotation.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:17.640]   Right.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:28.640]   Like genius there and annotation is a fascinating structure of wanting to leave comments on top of things in a way that's open and having multiple conversations around the same thing.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:33.640]   And then I argued too that embedding content is like a reverse annotation because where was this embedded?
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:35.640]   What does that tell you about the content?
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.640]   Huge new layer of possibilities there.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.640]   It'll be fascinating.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.640]   Yes.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:42.640]   I mean, that's one of the things.
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:49.640]   You know, that's another set of bits and pieces we've been doing in the indie website to try and think about this.
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:55.640]   So the idea of web mentions can work for annotations.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.640]   There's an example.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.640]   See if I can find the link for this.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:06.640]   There's, Karthik built this thing called Marginalia.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.640]   I'll put it in the IRC.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:23.640]   And this does this does that thing where it uses the fragmented idea, which was the thing I discussed last time with your annotation, which you put the piece you're linking to in the URL after the hash.
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.640]   So it says I'm looking to this piece of text.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:30.640]   So if you scroll down this post, you'll see little green things at the end of the paragraphs.
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:34.640]   Little speech bubbles.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:36.640]   They're a little subtle.
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.640]   And if you click them, it'll pop out the comment in line.
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:41.640]   And anybody could post that.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:43.640]   And that is a post that.
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:45.640]   Wow.
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.640]   Did you come on?
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:48.640]   I don't see any.
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:49.640]   Yeah, there's not cream bubbles.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:50.640]   There's bubbles.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:54.640]   I think it's a, it's a, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's got a frag mention.
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:55.640]   Scroll down there.
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:56.640]   Just pass fragmented.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:57.640]   There's one at the bottom of that paragraph.
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:58.640]   By the way, you were, you were.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.640]   I see.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:04.640]   Today's me and Kevin, you were quoted, Frank mentioned people loved the name.
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:05.640]   Okay.
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:08.640]   So you can see, so you see he's got this little speech bullet there.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:13.640]   If you click that, it's exposing the comment, but the comment is actually on somebody else's site that is linking back to this.
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:14.640]   Oh, that's amazing.
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:21.640]   If using the fractions to say I'm targeting this paragraph and it's using a web mention to say I commented on this paragraph.
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:22.640]   Wow.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.640]   So we've basically built the components to do this.
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:29.640]   So far, Cartic has, has built this little marginal script to do this on his site.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:32.640]   And I'm not sure that many other people have deployed this yet.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:38.640]   But again, it's, we have this set of building blocks that says, I want to refer to a piece of this page.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.640]   That's the fragmented part.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.640]   I want to let you know when I've mentioned you.
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:43.640]   That's the web mentioned part.
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:49.640]   And then by combining those two, he's able to build something like this that works very nicely.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:53.640]   It's, it's, so it's like the, again, it's like the medium comments that let you comment on the paragraph.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.640]   Right.
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:57.640]   Except that it doesn't all have to be in a database on one, on site.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.640]   It's a distributed way of doing that same idea.
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:01.640]   More personication.
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:02.640]   That's nice.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:02.640]   Right.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:13.640]   So the, the, the point of this is that by spending the, the point of the indie web stuff is to make, to think about how we can do this so that it doesn't all have to be hosted in one database.
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:17.640]   But we just, we define a protocol that will work between two sites.
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:22.640]   And because, you know, they're independent implementers, they try and keep the protocol small or not over complicate them.
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:26.640]   But then you can start changing together to do these interesting kinds of things.
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:31.640]   And that, the nice, then potentially you can build these bridges that go to the site.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.640]   Or the silos can start implementing these, these protocols as well.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:43.640]   There's nothing to stop a medium from adding these, adding the markup we need to do this or making this stuff something that will work across site.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.640]   They could, they, they're quite capable of doing that.
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:48.640]   The question is whether they want to give people that power or not.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.640]   And that's the, you know, that's, that's the trade off.
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:56.640]   But if they've already got a mechanism for accepting comments, arbitrary comments on paragraphs and people, it's just another way of them being posted.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:57.640]   There's no secure.
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:00.640]   Is there, is this opening security issues?
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:04.640]   Well, your, your site is in control of what it posts.
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:07.640]   So the, the comments is posting there.
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:12.640]   It has passed the HTML of the commenting page and decided which piece to post.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:18.640]   So it is doing a, you know, it's, it's not just injecting an iFrame with the whole page in.
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:22.640]   It's constructing the piece that is, is the comment.
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:29.640]   So it's, it's, yeah, there's a potentially, there's a potential injection issue if that, if that script isn't sanitizing.
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.640]   But that's, you know, no more than any other.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.640]   Yeah. And it's happens everywhere.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:41.640]   We, we, we, we, we've fairly well know how to deal with, um, taking HTML for one page and putting another page.
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:47.640]   Now, that's something that, that, you know, yes, you can get it wrong, but we know how to sanitize that stuff now.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:52.640]   If you want to know more about this indiewebcamp.com and go to an indie web camp.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:56.640]   If you, if you have an inclination, if you're intrigued.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.640]   I should also give a plug for the, um, homebrew website club, which is down there.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:02.640]   The bottom of that page.
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:09.640]   Um, they're held every other Wednesday and there's actually homebrew website clubs today in New York, San Francisco and Portland.
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:12.640]   Um, the New York one is starting soon, I think.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.640]   Um, six thirty click on the New York one.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.640]   Oh, oh, rush. I gotta, I gotta go.
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:17.640]   I gotta go.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:21.640]   Uh, where, where is the New York one?
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.640]   Uh, if you click on that one, there's a, there's a link to New York somewhere in there.
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:25.640]   Here we go.
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:26.640]   Uh, here we go.
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:27.640]   Uh, Snippers quality kitchen.
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:28.640]   Get down.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.640]   Oh.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:30.640]   An eighth and forty first.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.640]   That's right.
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:32.640]   That's right at the corner.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.640]   Snippers.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:34.640]   Is that near you?
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:35.640]   Yes.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:36.640]   The New York Times building.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.640]   I'd drop in.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:38.640]   Which is extra.
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.640]   Wow.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.640]   Jeff, drop by.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.640]   I think it's, it's, when we finish this show, you can, you can drop in.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:47.640]   I think it's, it all starts at seven thirty, I think, but there may be, um, may, I think there's, go back a page.
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.640]   There's a, there's a time and day on it.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:52.640]   It says 10 thirty, uh, but I bet you it's adjusting for my.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:55.640]   No, no, no, that's, um, yeah.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:56.640]   New York City.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.640]   Sick quiet writing hour six thirty seven thirty.
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.640]   And the meeting begins at seven thirty.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:02.640]   So that's right.
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.640]   He now or drop in Jeff.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:05.640]   So they'll have to see.
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:06.640]   Just going right.
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.640]   Open medium and they'll see what happens.
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:10.640]   They're right.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.640]   Well, they get out of here.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:18.640]   Well, the quiet writing out this was a, this was a thing that, um, Andy thought of, um, which was.
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:27.640]   We set this thing for six thirty, so you could get there after work, but some people could get there a bit earlier and then they could work on something they were working on before we have a, like the.
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.640]   I like this for all those.
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:30.640]   Oh, good.
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:32.640]   You got dinner and indie web.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:38.640]   Uh, I just, I really like the idea and I know it seems kind of a counter call.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.640]   It's a little counter cultural.
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:45.640]   It's an antidote to the highly corporatized commercial web, a web.
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.640]   It's made of people.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.640]   I like the idea.
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:56.640]   But it's, I mean, it's also thinking, you know, it's, it's tackling a lot of the same issues we've talked about about, um, how do you give access to the web to more people?
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:57.640]   How do you make it easy for them to publish?
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:58.640]   Right.
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:00.640]   But with an answer that isn't, oh, everyone should use Facebook.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.640]   Oh, everyone should use Google Plus or whatever.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:10.640]   It's, how can we do this in such a way that means that you're not required to log into a large company's server.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:30.640]   I mean, when you see these $9 computers and Raspberry Pies that are completely capable of running a good quality web server, it just seems like there's, uh, there's, we could have a much more human scaled fragmented web and fragmented in the best possible way instead of a monolithic web.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.640]   Facebook web.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:33.640]   This is the antidote.
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:36.640]   You still need to root to the service, which can be tricky.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:39.640]   Figure out a way.
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.640]   One thing is that, you know, cloud servers aren't expensive these days either.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:44.640]   So being able to put this up on, that's probably better.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.640]   Indeed.
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:47.640]   Google just lowered its prices by 30%.
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:54.640]   Every house should have a DMZ ethernet port in the wall that you could plug your Raspberry Pie server in server into.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.640]   Just get B6 working.
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:03.640]   It's, yeah, then, then gosh, your refrigerator could be your web server.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:05.640]   Everything could be your web server.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.640]   Anyway, I always, when you're on, I always want to give a plug for this.
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.640]   And then people glaze over and think, oh, I don't know what this is.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:11.640]   Can I just use Facebook?
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:12.640]   That's fine.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:13.640]   Go ahead and just use Facebook.
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:18.640]   But there are some few proud hippies out there who want to kind of.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:23.640]   But it's also that, um, you know, just because you're using Facebook doesn't mean we can't communicate.
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:34.640]   That's the other part of this is that part of this is that the idea of, of, of posse published on your own site, share elsewhere is that we can write it on our site and then send the link over to Facebook and then you can see it on Facebook.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:44.640]   But the other subtle thing is the stuff that has been set up with Bridget, which translates the Facebook comments into web mentions, so those can be come back to your site as well.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:48.640]   So you're able to move this stuff back and forth between the different servers.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.640]   Now that gets harder when the site has changed thing.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.640]   Facebook has just made it a lot harder for us to do that by changing the UI.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:54.640]   Oh, really?
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.640]   Nice.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.640]   And I'm not sure that was necessarily intentional.
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:02.640]   I think that's more that they didn't think about this use case when they changed the API.
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:11.640]   They're reacting to the perception people have that Facebook is too public and they want to give people more control of what happens to it.
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:16.640]   But what that ends up doing is make making it harder for us to take the bits that actually are public and make sense of them.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:18.640]   So that's been a bit of a shame.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:31.640]   And that's, that was one of the most fascinating things watching people sign up for known because no part of what known does is when you sign up for the site is it asks you, how do you want to connect it to your social media, what do you want to publish out?
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:35.640]   I'll give you buttons on the bottom of your post to let you share out which ones go where.
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:49.640]   And a lot of people are really, really wary of taking that connect to Facebook button because in their mind, publishing on the web is kind of public, but publishing on Facebook is really public because they go straight to the people who actually know you.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:53.640]   So they were much more concerned about connecting to Facebook than they were with showing how web's the site.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:57.640]   That's so funny since you have more control over Facebook than you do over the web.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:01.640]   Here's, by the way, this is my site.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:05.640]   Conceptually you don't. In your head, you don't understand quite what this is.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:11.640]   When you watch ordinary people use this rather than those of us who actually understand ACLs and things.
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:17.640]   In their head, if I post something to Facebook, it's going to go straight to my mum and my mum is going to complain about it.
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.640]   Right.
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:21.640]   There is there's a mental model of how that works.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:26.640]   And that's probably true because your mum on my mum on Facebook follows me and my sisters and that's about it.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:28.640]   So anything I post on there, she will see.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:34.640]   And my sons have a more nuanced attitude to this and they understand the stuff.
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.640]   So I didn't see anything they post on Facebook.
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:45.640]   But that is the mental model is Facebook is this place that is a social performance to a set of people you already know,
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:50.640]   whereas the web is a place where you can talk in a less focused way.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.640]   And that's a really interesting reversal.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:59.640]   And I think that's part of the trying to adjust that is what was the thinking behind the new Facebook API changes.
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.640]   But in practice, we end up with the worst of both worlds.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:05.640]   We have a set of people who don't want to connect to Facebook because it could be scary.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:10.640]   And then they break the API so we can't do the things we're doing with it as well.
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:13.640]   So it's a it has been a step backwards in that respect.
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:17.640]   Now I understand why Ben and Aaron Joe are slow to include some of the features we asked for.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:20.640]   They're busy fighting Facebook's API changes every too much.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:23.640]   This is I'm on my own site.
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:27.640]   I hosted it with known.com, but I could host this.
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:29.640]   In fact, I was hosting it locally for watch.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:31.640]   So I want to pay for a server.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.640]   I can write a post here and then because I've already connected Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn,
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:39.640]   I can automatically afford an image I could add Flickr and so forth.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:44.640]   And now when I publish this, it goes to all of them and state, but stays on my website.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:46.640]   And you could do long articles too.
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:47.640]   This is just a short status update.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:50.640]   So I think that's I think that's very cool.
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:56.640]   And I like it that it's centered on my own site as opposed to those sites.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:00.640]   And it just showed up in the indie web IOC channel as well.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.640]   Why is that?
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:05.640]   Because it because you said indie web and the hashtag Wow.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:08.640]   And the IOC channel looks for that's hysterical.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:11.640]   All right.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.640]   Let's take a break.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:16.640]   Come back tips, numbers, tools.
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:19.640]   Let me show you all that stuff at the back of the book.
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:31.640]   Let me tell you, this is a great solution for entities doing a mobile web mobile app, a mobile site or a mobile app to add payment APIs to that unbelievable.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.640]   So simple, just a few lines of code.
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:39.640]   And all of a sudden you're accepting Bitcoin or Apple pay or PayPal or credit cards.
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:42.640]   securely, easily.
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:45.640]   Braintree is amazing.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:47.640]   No wonder Uber uses them.
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:48.640]   Airbnb uses them.
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:49.640]   Lyft uses them.
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:50.640]   Hotel tonight use them.
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.640]   Everybody living social uses them.
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:59.640]   GitHub started at the very in the very early days and continues to use brain trees, their payments API.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:01.640]   Look at the new V.0 SDK.
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:03.640]   It works with all your favorite languages.
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:05.640]   It works easily, simply.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:09.640]   They've got great customer service, simple integration.
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:11.640]   You'll be ready to receive payments instantly.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:16.640]   Try the sandbox if you don't believe me and you can literally see how it would look with your code.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:22.640]   And brain trees continuous support plus fast pay at payouts means you'll be ready.
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:26.640]   They'll be with your company from the first dollar to the billion dollar.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.640]   Braintree turning companies into unicorns all over the place.
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.640]   They really are amazing.
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:33.640]   I want you to check it out.
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:34.640]   It's easy to do.
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:40.640]   Just go to braintreepayments.com/twig.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:50.640]   Yeah, braintreepayments.com/twig and to make it easy for you, your first $50,000 in transactions will be fee-free.

[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:07.640]   Braintreepayments.com/twig.
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:16.640]   You're watching this week in Google with Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York, the author of Geeks Bearing Gifts.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.640]   What would Google do in public parts?
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.640]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:23.640]   Kevin Marks is also here.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:29.640]   He's a legend in the microformats and standards business.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:31.640]   Nobody better.
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:33.640]   Kevin Marks.com.
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:35.640]   Kevin, you've shown us a bunch of stuff.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:43.640]   I think you're off the hook if you don't have a tool or a tip or anything, but if you've got something, we already showed you.
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:44.640]   In fact, I see your links.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:46.640]   Silo.pub and Quill.
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:47.640]   We're done.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.640]   I want your muted sound maker.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:51.640]   I'll show you that.
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:53.640]   Let me unmute myself.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.640]   Yes.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:44:05.640]   There's another little app that a friend of mine has built and I've helped him build some of it, which is called Will Someone.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:07.640]   So it's ask.willsomeone.com.
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.640]   Ask.will.someone.
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:16.640]   No, ask.willsomeone.com.
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:17.640]   All right.
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:18.640]   All right.
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:19.640]   I've got it.
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:23.640]   Will someone sign in with Google?
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:24.640]   That's the first one.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.640]   I better sign in, right?
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:28.640]   All right.
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:31.640]   Yes, I will sign in with Google.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:32.640]   All right.
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:33.640]   Allow.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:34.640]   Yes.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:35.640]   There's Google.
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:36.640]   Here we go.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:40.640]   Now, will someone, my name, what is this?
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.640]   What am I going to do here?
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:51.640]   So it's basically a to-do list, except that a task manager, except that you can get the tasks to other people to do for you as well.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.640]   So you can ask people to help you.
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:53.640]   Love it.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:54.640]   Oh.
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:45:00.640]   So, wash my windows.
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:01.640]   Okay.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.640]   That's the task.
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:03.640]   I'm going to add that.
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:05.640]   So I didn't have any tasks.
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.640]   So now I have one.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.640]   Okay.
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.640]   I can add details.
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:10.640]   I can add a due date.
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:12.640]   And now I can ask somebody to do it.
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:17.640]   So if you hit the ask button, you can share it out publicly or you can click on the Will someone.
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:22.640]   And then it becomes a global task that appears on the front page of the site.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.640]   So it's a simple idea.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:38.640]   This is Chris here who's had this idea that the challenges with task managers, everyone has their own, but it's nice sometimes to ask for help too.
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:39.640]   So that's the thing behind.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:41.640]   So this is fairly new.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.640]   It's just been out a couple of weeks.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.640]   But try it out.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:45.640]   Let me know what you think.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.640]   Will.
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.640]   Will.
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:51.640]   No, no, ask.willsomeone.com.
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.640]   Right?
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.640]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.640]   Ask.willsomeone.com.
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.640]   That's cool.
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:00.640]   Is this another indie web-y kind of thing?
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:02.640]   Well, I hope so.
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:04.640]   It has some indie web features in it.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:09.640]   So it does have the markup so that you can subscribe to it with indie web feed readers and things.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.640]   But it's not directly indie web.
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:16.640]   It's more of a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a silo app, but it's a, it's indie web friendly.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.640]   That's a, that's the phrase that we use.
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:21.640]   I get that first picture page I was looking at.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:24.640]   Now I understand that's my profile.
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:25.640]   Yes, that was your profile.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:28.640]   So I have to customize that a little bit with pictures and so forth.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.640]   Jeff, you got a number for us?
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:32.640]   Yes, I do.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:33.640]   I found it interesting.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.640]   There was a, a DNA India.com.
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:43.640]   Said there was a survey of 12,000 Indian students in grades age of 12, 90% of them use Facebook.
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:44.640]   No surprise.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:50.640]   Coming in at number two, Google Plus was 65%.
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.640]   Number three, Twitter at 44%.
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:57.640]   So I just, I don't, you know, maybe Google Plus is popular in ways.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.640]   People make fun of us for it.
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:02.640]   Maybe it's a little more popular elsewhere in the world.
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:03.640]   I don't know.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:05.640]   Just like our could.
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:06.640]   Exactly.
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.640]   Well, I think that was, they did migrate the awkward users to Google Plus, didn't they?
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:11.640]   There you go.
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:12.640]   Oh, is that it?
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:13.640]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:14.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:17.640]   I don't think there's anything wrong with Google Plus functionality wise.
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:18.640]   It's fantastic.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:19.640]   Oh, it's wonderful.
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:20.640]   It's wonderful.
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:23.640]   I wish, I wish it would, I don't know.
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:24.640]   I see Google.
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:31.640]   You know, make it more, you know what, make, you think that was a mistake that they never gave us a right API?
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:32.640]   Yes.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:35.440]   Well, they gave us one, but it, you couldn't, it was weird.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:38.640]   You could write to it, but it would, it was like uploading photos from your phone.
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:41.640]   They would disappear in a place that only you could see.
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:43.640]   And then they were very strict about not giving access to it.
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:50.640]   So that was, I think that was a reaction to what happened with buzz, which we used it as a place to, to syndicate to.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:54.640]   And so they were trying to avoid that and make it more native, but I'm not sure that was completely successful.
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:59.640]   And it would be nice if there was a way of doing it more, more generally.
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:03.640]   This article just came in, no, it didn't just come in.
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:05.640]   This is an old article, never mind.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.640]   It's not a new article.
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:09.640]   Let me show you Google tone.
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:10.640]   We didn't use it once.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:11.640]   I should have used it.
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.640]   Let me use it real quickly for ask someone.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:21.640]   So if anybody has tone installed, will, I mean, ask.willsomeone.com.
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:23.640]   I'm on the page now.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:27.640]   I'm going to press the tone button and you will hear a sound.
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:40.640]   A rather pleasant sound that if you have this Google tone extension installed in Chrome and the speakers turned up and your microphone turned on will bring you.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:42.640]   I know it's funny, isn't it?
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:45.640]   Bring you to ask.willsomeone.com.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.640]   Your browser just goes there.
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:57.640]   They say this was something cobbled together in an hour or two as a joke, kind of as a lark, as a laugh.
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:02.640]   Kevin, what do you think that tone, how is that tone community?
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:07.640]   It doesn't seem like it would have enough in there to communicate like a full URL.
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:08.640]   How is that working?
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:11.640]   Well, it sounds like it might do.
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:16.640]   I mean, the question is, is there more than one tone going there, but it's probably your real shortness equivalent.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:20.640]   Oh, they do a URL shortening, of course.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:24.640]   My guess is they're sending something that is like a look up in their database.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:25.640]   Right.
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:26.640]   Because it sounded like.
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:29.640]   So, do you give them a URL as I just did?
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:31.640]   Ask.willsomeone.com.
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:37.640]   It shortens it to, you know, GOO.TO/13419.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.640]   And then modulates it somehow.
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:42.640]   Then it sends 13419, whatever.
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:45.640]   Yeah, that would be easy, wouldn't it?
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:48.640]   Do you think these will get longer as more and more people use tone?
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.640]   It'll be like the Twitter URL shortness, where they're now often longer than some URLs.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:55.640]   24 characters after the T.co now.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:58.640]   The tone will go on for hours.
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:49:59.640]   Hours.
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:02.640]   It's nice and short right now.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:03.640]   That is funny.
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:11.640]   You know, this is like, I've got J.MP/K goes to my blog because I cut it on the first day they said that the URL shortness.
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:12.640]   Perfect.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:13.640]   But now the URLs are very long.
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.640]   So you can't do that anymore.
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:15.640]   Perfect.
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:20.640]   We have our own shortener, twit.TO, so we can use nice short ones.
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:23.640]   So you can pick your own namespace out of that, yeah.
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:27.640]   So the use case, the GOO gives, there really isn't any use case.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:29.640]   Actually, we're the best use case.
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.640]   You're listening to a podcast and you turn it up.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.640]   Yeah, that's actually a good use case.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.640]   That's actually a good use case.
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:36.640]   Well, it's kind of a horrible way to do it.
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:37.640]   But yeah, it'll be nice.
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:41.640]   It's a good use case for people who actually want to use it.
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:42.640]   For everyone else.
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:43.640]   It's just annoying.
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:53.000]   We used something a few years ago called chirp.io that did the same thing for one show.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.960]   But the use case Google gives is you're in a, this is a terrible use case.
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:03.320]   You're in an office situation and you want to hand off some websites to your colleagues.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.320]   Just what you want.
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:09.520]   Somebody in the office playing out loud, holding up a speaker.
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:11.960]   That's not a good idea.
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:20.240]   Anyway, my friends, we have come to the end, the conclusion of this silly little thing.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.920]   I'm so glad you could be here, Kevin.
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:24.520]   Always a pleasure and always a fondress or always.
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:28.960]   And I, and he's fighting the good fight for indie web and bounce.
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:32.880]   Now you got quill in your quiver, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:35.360]   You don't have to use that medium anymore.
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:39.680]   Yeah, you, I was sitting next to two medium people this morning.
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:43.720]   Because that's the other thing medium brings to the table is a community.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:44.720]   Yes.
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.320]   What you really want is a way to syndicate from your posse.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:51.080]   You're known, you're with known long to medium.
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:54.080]   And for that medium has to cooperate by giving us an API.
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:59.200]   Well, you know, I, I think we're going to embed stuff around the web more and more and
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:04.720]   the architecture Kevin is working on enables you to write what was and embed multiple times
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:05.880]   that's going to be beneficial.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:06.880]   I like that idea.
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:07.880]   Yep.
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:08.880]   Yes.
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:11.560]   Well, part of the challenge is what do you embed?
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:13.600]   How do you just decide what the preview is?
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:14.840]   And that that's that's what.
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:18.680]   So if, yeah, if I write a tweet length post that there's a comment on yours, then it's
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.920]   straightforward to work out what's been there.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:23.920]   But if I write full blog post that happens to cite you and you've got to work out how
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:24.920]   you can start to preview for that.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:26.920]   So that's something that we're experimenting with.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:27.920]   All right.
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:28.920]   I'm pissed.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:29.920]   What?
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:30.920]   I'm pissed.
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:31.920]   What?
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:34.720]   I just see the story on BuzzFeed was, oh, no, I'm pissed about lights off.
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:35.720]   Don't, don't.
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:41.000]   You know what we went an entire hour and 51 minutes without a Jeff Jarvis rant.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:47.960]   I didn't get invited to BuzzFeed reports that the camp Google Sicilian Davos returns
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:51.440]   for a second year, the secret of conference known as the camp.
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:54.880]   Oh, no, it was luxurious golf resort in Sicily.
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:58.000]   And we were not invited.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.320]   Who gets invited to that?
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.320]   Not us.
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:02.320]   Wow.
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:03.320]   Look at that.
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.320]   Beautiful.
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:11.000]   Beautiful Bay there on business leaders, tech luminaries and celebrities.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.540]   That's who gets invited.
[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:18.880]   We are none of the above.
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:24.520]   It's the, it's the Illuminati of the, or the Digiran, Elon Musk, Travis Kalanick, Evan
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:27.760]   Spiegel, John Dore, Lloyd blank fine.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.880]   Yeah, all the usual subjects.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.280]   I guess we're not up there.
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:32.520]   I don't want to talk to them.
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:33.920]   I don't want to be with them.
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:36.320]   I would never join a club that would have me as a man.
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.320]   No, I'd rather be an eye on.
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:39.320]   Mm.
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:40.320]   All right.
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.560]   Well, you're going to be next week.
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:43.720]   We will be back doing Twiggy.
[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:49.040]   It's usual time, which is 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:53.840]   2000 UTC on Wednesdays at live.tv.
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:58.200]   Jeff will be in studio because the following day is Google I own and you're going to go
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:01.720]   back and go to the keynote, but we'll broadcast the keynote.
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:02.920]   We will just plan to stream it.
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:07.200]   You of course can watch Google stream, but if you want our commentary on top of Google's
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:15.280]   stream and Gina, Trippani and I and Aaron Newcomb and from all about Android, Ron,
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:16.360]   what's his name?
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:17.360]   Richards.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:18.360]   We'll join.
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:20.120]   He's called Ron.
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:24.320]   Just Ronnie will join us and we will be and Jason how you're going to go.
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:27.120]   Mike Elkins going to go there both going down to get out.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.120]   Good.
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:36.240]   So coverage, special coverage begins 9.30 a.m. Pacific, 12.30 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:41.120]   16.30 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:43.760]   That is a week from tomorrow.
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.680]   So that's 5.28, May 28th for our special Google I/O coverage.
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:49.040]   I think it's going to be a good Google I/O.
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:50.040]   I'm excited.
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:51.040]   I think it is too.
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:52.040]   Yeah.
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:54.920]   I think it's interesting that we don't really know a whole lot about it this time.
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:59.840]   I feel like at about this point of the year leading into Google I/O week, we feel like
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:03.760]   we are pretty confident that we know a lot of what Google is going to talk about.
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:05.640]   We really don't this time around.
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:07.040]   So here's the question.
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:13.800]   On next week, will we say, wow, that was a big surprise or will we say, oh, I think
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.560]   there's some risk because last year was kind of an okay I/O.
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:17.560]   There's nothing really exciting.
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:20.040]   I think it's going to be kind of like that.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.040]   But you never know.
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:25.360]   We know we're going to get a new version of Android, but we don't know what it'll be.
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:26.960]   We got a new one last year.
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:31.840]   Everybody gets a Google refrigerator to take out.
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:34.440]   I imagine there will be some more VR-ish stuff.
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:36.640]   I think that is quite a likely thing.
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:39.000]   VR and I hope see some AR too because I prefer.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.240]   I'm more excited about AR.
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:42.240]   All right.
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:43.240]   All right.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:44.240]   All right.
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:45.240]   Thank you gentlemen.
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:46.240]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:47.640]   We'll see you next week on this week in Google.
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:57.640]   [MUSIC]
