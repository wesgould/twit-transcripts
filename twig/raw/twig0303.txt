[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.160]   Yay Gina Travani. Good to see you. Once a month we are blessed with Gina's presence because of
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.240]   course she's got her own dang startup she's very busy doing that old thing doing think up but
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.880]   it's going great I could tell. It's going well thank you yeah I'm happy to be here this is the
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.600]   first well we got to do the I/O keynote together. That was fun thank you for joining us yeah.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.800]   That was really fun yeah I was actually jealous I wasn't on the air with you guys.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.160]   Did you want to join oh you were in the I/O. I was in there I was there yeah.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.200]   Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York or is it Professor of Journalism Buzzmachine.com
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.360]   he's written the book What Would Google Do and many others including public parts in his latest
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.200]   geek sparing gifts and you were at Google I/O. I was like Google I was fun fun so was Mike Elkin our
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   news director yep and he's here too and Jason Howell and Jason Howell our producer whooohoo
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.840]   and technical director so Cal Lee you're surrounded by I/O.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.080]   So surrounded by people who have the new cardboard yeah there you go I am really close now I would
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.360]   I held off ordering the gear VR I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 but I think now I'm going to order it
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.040]   because it's you know because it's more comfortable than cardboard it has a strap one thing it's a
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.920]   strap on so you can leave it on I shouldn't oh my doorbell's ringing I hate it when that
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.520]   I am a little too wired now so but I think that the you know I've kind of come around on the VR
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.920]   thing yeah and it's funny it's cardboard that did it not Oculus Ritz yes that's right yes it's the it's
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.960]   the VR for the people and the audio reality for the people because it's going and I think one of the
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.680]   coolest things that they showed at the at the event Google I/O during the keynote was this this new
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.040]   program to get cardboard into schools yes and it's such a perfect solution because it's not like
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.600]   you know apples plan to get iPads into schools so that every school has to pay 600 for whatever
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.720]   dollars well wait a minute it's cheap cardboard's cheap but what's driving it and the reason is
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.440]   cheap is you still need a smartphone yes you do you know where's that coming from
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.400]   it's all got them now they you know it's oh no no no kids don't all got them and especially below
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.240]   sixth grade K through six well what they show what they showed was boxes that had the had the
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.120]   smartphones in them so I'm guessing that people you know people will cost the same as an iPad
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.800]   well depends on what phone you get right I mean they're definitely less expensive options
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.840]   what's the minimum I what's the minimum cardboard it's as well like I bought my um
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.200]   you don't need a phone connection you're on Wi-Fi at school okay so you could get what what then
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:34.000]   you can get an Android one for under 100 bucks and I'm sure that I mean you said that kids under
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.400]   the age of you know I've been reading a lot of stuff lately that shows that in the United States
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   at least a huge percentage of even sixth graders have phones and carry them every day to school and
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.840]   so it'll be one of those things where they'll say okay who's got their own phone okay who doesn't
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.440]   have a phone and then they can pass out the school's phones for for this purpose but the the benefit
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.560]   is that is as they as they talked about in the presentation is it's a way to get kids really
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.560]   super engaged to actually immerse them in the content that they're talking about rather than
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.080]   just sitting there listening to a teacher go on and on I think the value is massive and the
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.880]   the additional cost I think can be very very low of course Palo Alto school district will
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.160]   spend a fortune on brand new phones for all of them that's kind of my point it yeah it's this
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.280]   happens all the time the tech community gets all excited puts hardware into schools or
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.480]   you know sets us kind of stuff up and says hey see see you later bye-bye and there's no curriculum
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.600]   there's no training for the teachers in this case there's this assumption that everybody's got
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.640]   an Android smart or high-end smartphone I think they'd all have to be school issued because the
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.640]   teachers controlling them from the tablet right so they've all got to be school issued for this to
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.440]   be this is not a cheap thing you're talking about here if they roll this out well they're gonna
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.760]   do they're gonna focus on lower income with the kids really need it you know right so I hope we're
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.440]   gonna see things like donors choose and we're gonna see other programs hopefully Google's gonna throw
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.880]   money it's you know places other than you know Palo Alto and figure out ways to help people
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.040]   Google has a very compelling argument in the schools I mean either Chromebook is of course the
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.360]   best way to put a computing platform in a school but I'm not you know you know you
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.280]   everybody focuses on the fact that it's just the viewers cheap well but I think I think you're just
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.520]   a holder right but the way to look at this I think is that the alternative to to something
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.800]   like Google cardboard the alternative to low-cost VR and augmented reality is nothing
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.480]   that's not going to get cheaper than this in order to do VR you have to have a good display
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.360]   you have to have some sort of connection you have to have all the things that a smartphone has and
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.000]   there's no there are very few industries that have the economies of scale entire industries
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.840]   entire countries that have been built that have built industries around making all that stuff super
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.040]   super cheap and so I it's just it's basically the only alternative argument to if the argument is
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.320]   that this is too expensive then virtual reality has no place in schools well that may be another
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.960]   argument yeah yeah it's the cheapest virtual reality you can get well said Mike you know so a rubber
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.400]   waiting pool would also be the cheapest pool you could get doesn't necessarily mean that this
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:16.480]   ballers in the schools and there's this a whole additional thing of you okay so you've got okay
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.680]   let's say you figured out a way to get all the kids cardboard now you got to get the teacher
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.320]   a tablet and you got to get curriculum associated with it you know remember the LA Unified School
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.640]   District put said they were going to put an iPad in the hands of every student they made a deal
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.560]   with Pearson developed curriculum and it's been a horrible failure they're suing both
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.880]   uh apple and Pearson curriculum wasn't developed the teachers weren't trained most of these iPads
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.800]   ended up in the back of the classroom unused I it kind of makes me mad because I think
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.480]   Silicon Valley and and we tech enthusiasts love this idea of tech in schools but we don't follow
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.880]   through we don't go the whole distance on it you know yeah yeah that's true you know another
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.080]   thing here at the Leo is that if you look at an elementary school it's not like every classroom
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.840]   needs a setup right one setup for an entire school you're buying one per class right you're
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:14.000]   buying a team about one per school yeah and uh you know Paulson just gave 400 million dollars
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.320]   to Harvard the last school on the earth that possibly needs it no I agree Ross be had it there
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.760]   and I'm hoping the school is probably the least of the problem yeah I don't say this is the first
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.560]   thing to buy at all I agree with that too yeah Museum of Natural History was at IO they did one
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.560]   of the explorations um you know I'm going through the same thing in news people are going gaga over
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.360]   VR and I'm saying well hold on it really hasn't had any impact yet we really have you know it's
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.320]   yes it's the latest new shiny toy what's it what's its real value going to be under determined
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:49.440]   nonetheless yes we go god god we see that's cool I'm excited I want to build a jump camera that's
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.560]   the 16 GoPro or 16 doesn't have me go pros but that's the demo 16 camera rig that GoPro will sell
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.600]   but you could also build yourself and then the jump software assembles it and I if my sense is
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.400]   you could do this in real time which means I could say to our audience watch live you can
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.240]   download the show later but if you'd like to watch live as if you're in the studio with us
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   we have set up one of these rigs right where you would be sitting and now you can look around and
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.720]   participate oh that's interesting you can imagine a whole different kind of talk show yeah
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:28.640]   where it's not just a camera going to one level it's that you're in the middle of of of
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.920]   couches of a discussion right you know we look around as people talk that's that's cool you know
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.560]   imagine imagine a round table like like the kind that Alex Lindsey built for other purposes for
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.520]   conversations and you have it in the middle of the table yeah we could do that and and
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.040]   and that's the yeah wouldn't that be great and then you hear somebody talking over here so you
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.840]   turn this way and so on that's very by the way and dr mom saying oh great twitch's gonna now make
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:10:00.080]   me barf believe me I get nauseous with the Oculus Rift absolutely I've never gotten nauseous with
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.040]   a non-sure why with cardboard but I think it's because you're not you're not moving
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.320]   and the thing isn't it's not you don't have this situation you didn't rift where you're not
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.880]   moving physically but you're moving virtually that is disorienting the inner ear that is what
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:21.200]   makes you nauseous I think there's also latency issues I'm sure that that's not necessarily solved
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.240]   in in cardboard but I don't I never was bothered by it partly because too because you can just go
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.400]   like this yeah right you don't you're not gonna really say spend hours you're not playing a game
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.160]   the games are what makes you nauseous frankly right my wife has inner ear uh vertical problems
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.800]   and and so Jake and I were showing her cardboard and I tell you it was three seconds as she said but
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:48.080]   okay yeah it threw then it then it maybe will make you nauseous yeah they're telling me to
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.640]   pronounce it nauseous but then this isn't that isn't that jump rig a reason to have a reporter
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.760]   on the scene Jeff yes the reporter in the in the wind getting blown away
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:05.280]   Jeff Hayes Jeff Hayes local news standups
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:11.200]   it's the expedition you know where where here come to the scene this is this is where it was
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:17.360]   kind of be kind of interesting from from a news productive yeah uh apparently
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.080]   hockey night in Canada has done this really yeah you can look to the two different team benches
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.320]   so me and the charams telling me that they should use this instead of the puck imagine the view you
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:38.400]   get out hitting me okay I should be saying nauseated not nauseous according to doctor mom
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.720]   they're two different things and and by the way this is one of the reasons why augmented reality
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.280]   is absolutely going to rule over virtual reality because you don't get nauseous exactly you're
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.960]   seeing are nauseated exactly you're seeing objects being placed in the real world but you still
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:57.360]   see the real world which satisfies your inner whatever by the way cardboard can't be used as
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.360]   augmented reality but things like the gear VR can because the gear VR can use pass through with
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.920]   the camera so you you put your phone there I don't know why they didn't do this with cardboard but
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.720]   chair scissors and you could yeah just cut off the camera I think one of the reasons is that they
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.000]   are trying to be ultra compatible with all the phones right and they don't know where the camera
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.320]   hole is some can't so you could buy one for your specific phone that would work I would think so
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.840]   or just come on software uh no I think it's already the soft much of the software will do that it
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.080]   actually asks for permission to use your camera when you install the app yeah so that maybe is just
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.680]   this cardboard that doesn't yeah doesn't do that there are many cardboards in the
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.960]   are are can you buy the second generation cardboard out there already oh yeah really
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.760]   uh Google has a google at least on their site uh says get a viewer and shows uh
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.720]   they're selling them um well they have buy at links on on all of these let me check so let's like
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.560]   the view master was the Mattel one that probably is yeah not yet out dodocase.com has the new one
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:05.280]   that's easy right yeah so this is view master see this I could see in schools yes see the dodocase
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.920]   has yes devices that have the the camera exposed uh you know cardboard kits that have the camera
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.440]   exposed right for augmented reality they also have a virtual reality hat where the cardboard
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.040]   hangs from the brim of a baseball hat how about this one this is the Knox aluminum aluminum aluminum
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.600]   VR viewer the only machined and handcrafted crafted metal VR viewer with a hint of wood
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.080]   85 bucks well but that's cheap compared to an Oculus Rift which will be probably five or six hundred
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.040]   bucks there you know the problem with it is I just want one where it doesn't show your forehead
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.960]   grease okay you're gonna like this one this is the one we we have these these lying around somewhere
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:54.160]   this is the CI or C1 glass 22 bucks it's very lightweight it folds up because basically it's
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:04.080]   just a it's a plastic frame that holds it so uh do all these now fit six inch phones well you
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:10.080]   have to get one the compatible this one says Nexus six yeah but but these are all third party
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.320]   vendors I'm looking at store.google.com and I don't I don't see Google themselves selling it unless
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:20.480]   they never sold it well I can buy they never sold it they just published the plans yes that's right
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.200]   and that's by the way the other way to do it is just to get your 3d printer out and download
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.000]   the plans and make your own damn it that's what that's what you should do if you're a real VR user
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.280]   eel maker geek real maker and of course we were treated once again to the site at Google I/O
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.800]   of a large number of people all using some sort of virtual reality and it people always look like
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.920]   idiots yeah like staring at the space especially in a group you really want to do this in the privacy
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.200]   of your own house yeah you have a picture on the look okay let me go plus obviously if it's
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:00.560]   dot google.com slash plus jeff jarvis see if I can find it
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:06.160]   when you know what this is good because we covered and if you didn't watch you probably should
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:14.160]   watch our twit live special google I/O coverage Gina and I and uh Erin Newcom no it's not there
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.120]   uh but but so you should know and oh and then Mike suggested I think it was a brilliant idea
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:26.560]   that we also air the next day the ATAP the advanced technology group of video yeah that was really
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:33.360]   cool I was excited about many of the things I saw there but let's get the experience of oh here
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:42.240]   we go yeah you got the picture up oh there it is this is straight out a wallie and you thought
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.760]   people texting in restaurants was anti-social I'm depressed and then and then here's the better
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.800]   so at at the google party I guess because of noise regulations in seresisco they had to turn
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:58.000]   the music off at nine o'clock so they distributed wireless headsets to everyone so they were all
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.800]   bopping to the music that you couldn't see that before yeah with that too and then it would be
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.960]   the ultimate google experience to make fun of for the world yeah now you know it's funny galex
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:15.440]   that the Samsung folks uh did a demo of galaxy vr for a nicoleat uh engadget one of the things
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:21.680]   they said it's really a wonderful social experience because one of the things they have on the galaxy
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.760]   vr is the ability to watch a movie and you're actually in a movie theater you could see empty
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:31.120]   seats around you you can look at the screen look behind you and they said it's so cool when three
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.720]   or four of you are sitting around with your now the nice thing is at least you could strap this
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.480]   on you don't have to hold it watching a movie and you could talk to each other about what you're
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:46.240]   seeing yeah well i hate people who talk in movies i hate that what wait a second
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.760]   go on a movie theater in my own home means that i'm sitting in front of my tv on my couch i know
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.240]   i see empty theaters surrounding me i don't know well that's what you're going to see for a while
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.920]   with all of this vr is a lot of stuff stupid stuff and of course mark zakoburg says that someday
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.080]   the future of facebook is in virtual reality you'll be just hanging out with people in virtual reality
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:12.720]   yeah that's going to be that's going to be awesome it's nice to see you how's the hip actually see
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.680]   he's like a nightmare hey look a cat
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:26.480]   uh i am going to order one of these gear vr helmets yeah i they said on a plane then this is a good
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:33.440]   use for it if you really want to get nauseated yes get on a plane put on your gear vr and sit back
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.320]   just don't go like this to your well versus sitting next actually an airplane is a perfect place for
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.120]   that i think they have a little barf bag right there you're ready i was actually one of those on a
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.080]   plane that i would do yeah isolate yourself isolate right it's the one place that you just want to be
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.680]   as far away as possible you know what you know what the killer app is for that it's a it's an app that
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:18:01.760]   simulates you being in first class yes that that's what you want to believe that seat actually
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.720]   was empty exactly exactly right right you look down your knees are not pressing up against the
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:13.840]   the seat in front of you yeah yeah uh yeah go ahead effin done effin done oh you're not here can you
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.840]   he says his gear vr is over on the uh he leaves it on the table on his desk i couldn't say i'm
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:26.480]   sorry i made that for more units than their own phone why should they that's not that's not how
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:32.880]   they're sold for them um well first of all they say that this is a like a like a beta project they
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.920]   don't even say this is a finished thing they want to be apple they want they want you to like have
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:44.080]   complete buy-in to the samsung universe in order for you to use that how's that working yeah exactly
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.040]   well there's different also there's more software because uh samsung has its own software suite for
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:55.840]   its own vr yeah that's what they want to sell right there sell the software no the phone well yeah
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.760]   why not in fact this is specific to galaxy uh s6 yeah and the other one is specific to the note
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.960]   but don't forget this is an oculus rift device exactly it says oculus on it even though it works
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.600]   with cardboard so there's kind of this i think that's good that means there's going to be kind of a
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.640]   yep and youtube is going to support this right yep in fact i think i can can i do now i can do
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:22.160]   youtube stuff on this if i turn on my cardboard you can you can you can you can do google maps
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.800]   stuff as well neat yeah so there is a there is a section now in the play store for cardboard
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:38.480]   um get more cardboard apps and by the way the thing we're looking at on the screen is the jump
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:43.920]   platform which is the back end yeah and this is really sophisticated stuff people uh dial into
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.800]   the thing that holds the cameras and that of course is open sourced and you can essentially
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.280]   build your own depending on what cameras you're using not you the user but like companies that
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:20:00.240]   have cameras can do this GoPro did it uh but the really amazing part is the massive data crunching
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:08.400]   behind the scenes to take all these disparate live video streams and to create new 3d surround
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:16.160]   video that is very complex and very computationally expensive and and complex and and so that's the
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.160]   part that's really the magic here i think yeah you know you know Mike i think i think the untold
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:28.240]   story of of IO was for that and photos and so much else it was really about deep learning AI
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.160]   large neural networks only google only google i think can do what they're demonstrating here the
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.120]   the fact that that major computing power has become trivial yep to them all right but just
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:44.560]   analysis go to the go to the play store and look at i know you're get you're you've left VR but i'm
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:51.840]   back again look at all the apps there's an adult swim app for VR here's Jurassic VR there are paid
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:58.800]   apps for cardboard you're gonna start seeing this may be it's so i you know what i love about this
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.600]   google completely scooped facebook yep and their oculus rift but you're saying well what if we did
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:10.800]   some cardboard and uh what if you know and then already these are all apps have we ever heard who
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.720]   the two people who sat around a beer are saying you know bro did i have a cardboard you want to
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:22.240]   you want to interview them this to me is the essence of google just get some of the concert
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.960]   and then tweak it look at this instead of they used an Apollo at a paul macarney concert and you
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:34.640]   can go there now and sit on the stage with paul this is on the app store and it's free
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.200]   isn't that interesting i mean this is this is already an ecosystem yeah and they haven't released
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.680]   your VR yet either yeah i'm a downloading paul macarney right now i haven't heard about the
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.080]   makers i want to get these these people in maker base i leave looking at the at the wikipedia page
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:58.800]   i don't see yeah who was responsible for this because it was a 20 project i believe
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:04.080]   that but you know what their 20 google's 20% is really paid off yep what do they get out of that
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:11.680]   gmail um somebody lose so many things all right i'm sorry i went back to vr g cool vr no no i
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:17.360]   wasn't trying to change subject i was just uh extending no i think it's really interesting to
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.600]   see what google's up to i really do but again i think this is the i think this is the essence of
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.320]   google and what gives them a huge advantage they have the guts to come out with stuff that isn't
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:33.280]   done now we're probably later in the show and uh gonna talk about um this uh this thing that
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.040]   everybody's complaining about that take you take take a picture of your food porn
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.520]   yeah and tells you how many calories and it's like oh it doesn't work that can't possibly oh if
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.120]   it doesn't work well people are saying that it's the inaccurate plus calories is a bad measurement
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.000]   for food and so on but the google philosophy unlike the sort of oculus philosophy which is work on
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.240]   it work on it working for four years now they've been working on oculus and still we have nothing
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.560]   in our hands google just put something out there and let's all keep working on it it's about
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:04.640]   agile use it exactly that agile yep so i have to download it turns out the gear vr app as well
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.600]   did you get that in 3d like yeah download it's it's and welcome to gear vr now download take
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:15.440]   your take your phone out and download the app exactly don't try to do this on a live show yeah
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.840]   it's at that um everybody i steve kipson was thrilled about his project solely so this is
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:29.440]   one of the a-tap things this is it's like radar it's a chip that sends out a um i don't i don't
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.720]   know technically what the technology is is it like a theremin isn't it yeah it's yeah it's a
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:40.800]   navigational theremin yeah yeah yeah and it can sense movements and stuff this thing was really
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:47.040]   uh very exciting uh because it could be a whole new way of interoperate of using your computer
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.560]   yeah uh or your computing device well or or yeah computer device you know interacting with a
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.320]   vending machine or with a or clothes yeah because of project check card there i mean you could i mean
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.560]   it's fair i just think google is is knocking out of the park in every respect very exciting there's
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:10.000]   the use case in is that i think is the most exciting is in a smartwatch because they made a big
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   point of showing how small they got the chip already and it's they haven't even you know still
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.040]   early days in this thing and and it's the size of a dime yeah what i want is alternative uh air
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:28.880]   typing yeah with some way to get to 26 letters by motions without having to have anything physical
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:36.400]   yeah i mean of course you wouldn't do as a courty would you you'd use some if you'd like to touch
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.280]   your touch your your your knuckles or do a circle or well you know what it is well you can
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:48.400]   imagine asl with that exactly that's everybody would have to learn that asl yeah teacher you know
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:54.800]   edda should learn asl now yes yes that's perfect because it's complete language it's in every
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.200]   care for the future it's it's a it's a approach to language that exists in many many languages
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.360]   that's perfect it's is it sound waves
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:10.480]   i don't know what it is yeah it's magic i mean it's just magic yeah
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:16.400]   it's very low energy i asked you know maybe it's the i don't know what it is it's gonna fry us all
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.720]   oh it is but who cares i don't mind i for one
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:28.240]   prepared welcome our new friend i welcome our new friend i love the fact that google bought
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.880]   Motorola and this was originally part of Motorola and then they sold Motorola and they said you know
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.840]   what we're gonna keep this bit do they look crazy like a fox now oh absolutely yeah and that was the
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.800]   whole point of the patents too so yeah the patents were valuable yeah the phone's not so much right
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:49.920]   exactly exactly exactly uh wow you know they look so smart uh we were talking uh jina about
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:55.600]   android m during the live stream mmm what are your takeaways on the new version of android
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.800]   uh you know i'm excited i mean visually it's not the kind of huge upgrade that we got with
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.000]   ollie pop material design but i'm really excited about some of the new features um particularly around
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.920]   the easier permissions permissions that don't make you feel like you're signing your life away the
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.160]   minute that you install your app permissions that happen in flow that's something i like that i'm
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:21.040]   apple just that yeah fingerprint um detection excited about that excited about android pay
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:27.440]   even though you know i mean google's taking a few shots at at contactless payments and just
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.880]   payments in general but um i was excited about that i think that you know in general it's i think
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.040]   in general it's a fairly subtle upgrade but there's some good stuff here better
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.440]   met battery management i mean look we're always trying to make our devices go longer but that
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:47.680]   does mode and battery saver that may be the most important single piece if they could if they really
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.920]   did impact battery life significantly that's huge mm-hmm the other thing that i think is absolutely
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.600]   huge is google now and now on tap yeah is that come does that come with them yes it does and it's
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:04.640]   it's one of the biggest it's probably the biggest reason to not use an iphone because you can't do
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.960]   this on on an iphone and therefore this is one of the rare cases where google likes to have
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:14.000]   everything on every platform that it can but apple won't give this kind of access so as an
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.040]   example you're looking at any app and you can just basically press and hold the home key and it'll
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.760]   just pop up all the information that knows about whatever's on the screen another part of this is
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:31.120]   where you can basically developers can build in google now compatibility and then you can use
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:36.640]   whatever is going on with the app in context so for example let's say there's music playing and
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:42.880]   you're listening to a pandora song on pandora you can say who is this and it knows who this is
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.520]   knows what the word this means based on the context of the app itself there that's just one
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:54.080]   trivial example but it just it just turns it takes google now and it puts it anywhere and
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:59.360]   everywhere which is amazing i think google has finally decided that it's going to ignore the
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:05.520]   privacy advocates and just go ahead yeah and if you don't like it if you don't want google reading
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:12.640]   every screen on your phone use an iphone yeah fine in fact that's what cook's doing is differentiate
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.280]   himself saying oh we don't have an advertising model we don't snoop on you also don't know me
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.440]   yeah good and i hope they do that because i'm tired of google kind of
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.440]   saying well we're gonna we're gonna slow down we don't want to face recognition we don't want
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.680]   to do anything yeah slow down we got to be you know what google should you say okay that's fine
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.200]   for those of you who are willing to give us more information we will be more valuable
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.320]   experience for you for those who aren't we'll be less valuable and and if you really don't want
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   to give us anything there's other choices out there tragically one of the reasons they can do that
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:47.840]   is that we've all been bludgeoned by news about all these hacks our private information has been
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.360]   hacked at target it's been hacked by the irs it's been hacked in all these locations it's just
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.240]   i think people have accepted the fact that personal private information of the kind that you interact
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:05.040]   with online is just available it's just out there by all kinds of for all kinds of uses and and to
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.480]   serve up contextual advertising and to give you better you know pre-emptive virtual assistant
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.400]   results is the most innocuous result of that data harvesting do you think at his generation
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:23.440]   we'll just say oh who needs privacy i mean we're getting there right i mean i i think there's kind
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:30.240]   of this feeling of like the benefit of of things like this outweighs you know the risk i think i
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.520]   think i think a lot of people feel like well i mean you know what what i have to hide it's just
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:39.120]   so convenient right that that's what that's what that's the security versus convenience trade-off yeah
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.320]   that's the risk of the yeah yeah and i mean i think you know where maybe more aware of it than
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:50.080]   than a sort of normal consumer but i think that's generally the feeling i mean that worries me a
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.680]   little bit i think we should need to think about the implications i mean when they showed now on tap
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.720]   but on the stream i mean the first thing i thought was wait a second they're now on tap there's
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:05.680]   summonsing this now on tap in a non google app right so yeah i know that google has access to all
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.600]   my personal data in google apps i i agreed to that right there's a there was a change in their
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.320]   privacy policy a few years back and i said okay fine right calendar knows about gmail now knows
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:20.960]   about all of them okay fine but but if i'm having a private you know conversation with my spouse on
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:27.040]   a third-party sms app or you know uh you know i don't know any sort of you know third app and
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.840]   even as a developer i'm thinking okay i make it to do list does this mean that that google you know
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:39.520]   now on tap now sees my users to do this yeah i mean i i yeah so that that jumped out of me instantaneously
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:44.080]   i was like wait a second how is this happening is the user-granting permission how is it screen
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:49.520]   scraping what's going on so there's this assist api uh it's a brand new api that's going to be in
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:56.240]   in android m that actually gives access to any assistant type like app like now on tap so that's
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.840]   interesting because there might be other assistance apps not just now on tap and the developer sets a
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:06.320]   flag that you know in a sensitive view where you might have personal information the developer
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:11.920]   can set a flag that says secure so that says now on tap can can access this information otherwise
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:17.280]   the developer can expose now i feel like that's a weird role for developer to be in i you know i
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:23.280]   might be having the default is open then the default is open because no no app new this existence so
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:28.080]   thus people will have to go back in and retrofit or if you have an app that has all sorts of private
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:34.560]   stuff in it and it's not updated does it just give it all to google this should be my choice
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.480]   right and there's so we don't know there's a lot of this we don't know i don't know if it's on by
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.800]   default if it's enabled by default i don't know if users to come out turn this on and off probably
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:48.320]   uh right because you can turn on now on and off so probably but it's it's until you summon it though
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.200]   jina until you know but maybe here's the difference maybe here's the difference it's not like google
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.960]   is listening to all your activity and all the apps it's when you pushed on the button you are
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.520]   purposely summoning now on tap to say please give me context for what i'm doing right now that's an
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.280]   easy thing to do by accident for one thing well right you accidentally press it okay okay you
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.440]   can do lots of space but i but i i think as a principle i think there's got to be not to be
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:17.680]   as a no but as a principle the act of summoning google now on tap is an option too easy to do
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.200]   because why else would you do it not because what how do you summon it
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:26.160]   you do not have the whole press i never have a long tap on the home button you don't paying
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:31.200]   attention you accidentally forget to let go on the home button i do it all the time all right
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.880]   that is not a long tap while scratching my head okay now well i'm just no but i'm just saying
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.200]   yeah this is what it has to do then the first time and i'm sure they will is do what they do with
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:46.640]   google now the first time here's what it is are you in and you have to say yes i'm in or it won't do it
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:52.160]   right but i think but my point of gnet is that let's say let's say you generally say it's okay
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.840]   it's on then it's not like google is listening to your app activity all the time it's when you ask
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:04.480]   it to it will give you contextual suggestions uh and then the other question is what happens to
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.280]   that exactly that is this is the question is it local to the phone or is it sending back to google
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:15.520]   servers saying hey what are these pictures of leo uh what is going on here is there anything
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.760]   you can do with this yeah there's a lot going on the seat behind the scenes here and and while i
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:27.040]   agree that this is an incredible incredible feature and i and one of the one of the best things that
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.160]   they showed off i want to know more well as a developer you want to know more too right certainly
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.160]   as a developer i want to know more i mean i i have i have a lot of users that are don't like the idea
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:40.560]   that their to-dos or you know sync to drop box which is a choice i made like oh hey let's sync to it you
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:47.520]   know so you know like if google can look at your to-do list or your private you know chats and i
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.280]   don't think this should be a developer choice i think this should be a user choice so and maybe
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.840]   it's both um but i'm interested to see how this is how this is how the permission's work
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:00.720]   uh but but it's very it's a very cool feature and i and i get you jeff that you're summoning now on
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:05.200]   tap it's possible that now on tap that i mean it's using the the google view hierarchy or the android
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:10.400]   view hierarchy i think to to get it to to say what is contained in this view what taxes contained in
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:16.000]   this view and it's possible that locally it's able to say oh this is a pronoun that represents a
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.720]   restaurant but most likely i mean it's got to be making calls back to the server to say what is
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.880]   this restaurant what's the number what what it's not the only context it's also going to it's going
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:30.000]   to use the other things that it can get like like location time of day uh knowledge of where you
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.480]   live versus where you are now um that contact i mean the point of this all is context context context
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:42.720]   blood sugar level from your smartwatch uh skin sensor well i mean with diabetics in the family
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.440]   yeah that would be a wonderful thing yeah i'm deep the watch can tell you when you're hungry
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.160]   so so the uh one of the interesting things that came out of i/o that's related to this topic the
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.440]   topic being what does google do with this personal information we've all been marveling and ooing
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.640]   and eyeing over the google photos capability of recognizing dog breeds and different kinds of
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.480]   food and things like that which just looks amazing how do they do that and one of the
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.080]   concerns people have is the um recognition of people's faces which they demonstrated goes all
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.640]   the way back to infancy somehow which that has not been explained and it does not work i might
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:22.320]   add it doesn't work it works better than it should but not as not perfectly enough to really use it
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:30.000]   but but the um luigi came moment yeah so so no but wait a minute i i'm okay can you explain the
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.760]   reference without everything is everything is awesome and nobody's happy yeah okay gee
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:41.680]   it missed me at four years old yeah no i just want to point out it's not perfect but one of the
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.800]   interesting things that they said about this uh in the google photos press conference is that the
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:53.760]   the they're not actually doing identity in other words they have a internal uh uh
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:59.280]   nerdy database entry thing of identity this is a person and there's all the things we know
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:04.000]   about this person the the photos app doesn't use that in other words it doesn't know the
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.440]   difference between a grilled cheese sandwich and somebody's face it just knows that these these
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.880]   are associated with each other and so you're on this far away from your nose exactly at this age
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:22.720]   and as you grow so for example if i took a picture of one of my kids and i i labeled it grilled cheese
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.040]   sandwich it would from then on think that that was every picture of my kid but i would come up
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.960]   when i search for grilled cheese sandwich so give it your love of food i'm surprised you didn't
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:38.000]   name your kid so how much of that has to do with this this is a big change in google if you go to
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.960]   any google page now remember you used to have a picture of yourself and if you click on it
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:50.000]   it you drop it down it would show my profile no longer do you go does it say my profile right
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.080]   no longer do we push to google plus yet another way we're chiseling away google plus it says my
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.520]   account now and you'll get this you'll get this page in fact google's been pushing people for the
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.560]   last couple of days anytime you go to your google account to this page my account control
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:10.800]   protect and secure your account all in one place and this is not quite the dashboard but this is
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:18.160]   this is i think in some ways this is google's proactive way to respond to some of the concerns
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:23.200]   that you're having this is the convenience versus risk thing right so at at at i/o they had to show
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:28.880]   off they'd emphasize the convenience and in that in that new thing they have to minimize the risk
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.520]   right they have to make you feel like okay this is yes i have control here i know where what's going
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:38.880]   on uh i'm okay with consenting to this right so that it has to be really a two prompt approach
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.120]   this is for people who aren't regulars is the show we've talked about this maybe a year ago
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.440]   that's was a larry page interview was it larry i think it was larry maybe it was Bradley
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.760]   who are what somebody says i'm google uh executive said it was sundar i don't know
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:57.360]   that there's the two faces of that coin and that we've not we've not done such a good job
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:03.120]   we've done a job explained the benefits but not such a good job of consent and so and they go
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.360]   together you can't do one without the other so this isn't you're exactly right you know this is
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.840]   in action that philosophy that they describe gina i think the other thing about it is too is that
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.320]   this allows google to argue that there is a benefit of pulling all your data together
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.200]   yeah because you can control it at once whereas the argument in europe is oh no no no just because
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.800]   you bought another service you can't pull there you know but you want youtube doesn't mean you
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:30.720]   can have youtube data and and google well now you can have control across all google services
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:37.280]   right let's take a break we're come back with more there's lots to talk about yeah we haven't we
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.320]   have we have i think we've talked enough about photos on every other show including paul
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.880]   tharat and windows weekly was singing its praises i was all i was amazed never liked anything from
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:52.400]   google no it just shows you i mean it's everybody's excited about this yeah i was surprised the
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.440]   new york times led with with cardboard and b r in their story i thought photos was unquestively
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:03.040]   the lead of i/o you know why i've just been told there is a new york times magazine cardboard app

[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:26.640]   big changes over there at ev Williams is a medium is it a pivot or is it a refinement or are they as
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.360]   retreat somebody just said throwing anything up against the wall and seeing what sticks

[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:49.920]   what you want uh kind of think of it as an ombudsman for your smart home a central hub that talks to
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:56.160]   everything and then your single application you know that talks to it and i have to say i was
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.680]   a little disappointed when i read about what others are doing because they still you're still
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.800]   installing a hundred apps on your phone i want one app and that's what smart things does smartthings.com

[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:41.280]   i've gone through the fairly elaborate onboarding oh no i'm just off to verify my email i gotta say
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.640]   that sitting next to you here it's it's so much it's so much easier to look at your screen
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:53.280]   you know violation of every social norm you've established look at my screen my friends it's yours
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:59.520]   i give it to you um what were we what did i say we would talk about next medium medium medium
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.640]   that's not necessarily next but yeah we could talk about that what's going on over at medium
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:08.320]   i i actually was kind of excited because i finally made a medium account and everybody i follow on
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:14.880]   medium if they annotate an article i see their annotations i didn't know about that that's cool
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:20.720]   is that is that cool i mean it depends it depends well depends on how many people are annotating
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:26.640]   and i mean it could be what was the article that i was oh it was uh steven levi's interview
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:33.840]   with uh bradley hoorowitz oh right yeah um and so i was getting uh evan williams annotations
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:40.240]   i was getting um uh christmecina's annotation yes i want to see what christmecina thinks about
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:45.760]   anything well they want to turn it into a social network and i guess that's one way to build comments
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:53.520]   right into the body of the post-slash article yeah you know you know and i love interactivity
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:59.280]   and um mr. interactivity it's not the medium i signed up for obviously it's changed and the
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:07.600]   problem is you know the advantage i saw is that the author of the piece um chooses whether or not
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:13.440]   to make public the comments that are in line so here's mg seagler's comment actually highlighting
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.320]   just all all he did was mark it mark it it's not really so they they also lowered the barrier to
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.320]   having an impact so you mark stuff but you don't make a comment i felt my comments pretty much
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.640]   disappeared to my latest piece oh it's just highlighting it's just highlighting in that case
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.080]   you but you can also comment but most times now it's just highlighting because it's the easier
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:35.120]   path but you know okay that's vaguely interesting but then if you go to the bottom of the piece
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:43.360]   they have responses there and so what's happening is the old bad comments are back
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:49.680]   stupid off topic crappy comments are in there with smart comments now no Stephen
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.840]   leave me explain to me that what happens is the author of the piece still has a special right
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:59.120]   because if i recommend a piece it will appear on the first page if i don't it won't still there
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:04.560]   but it's on the second page but i understand what evs try to do you know people weren't
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:11.600]   spending enough time just reading so he wanted to have a network structure and i get that
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.840]   but i think we've got to think real hard about what comes it's bad with the network structure
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.200]   i i met with one of the people at washington post is doing project coral
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:23.840]   which is an effort from mozilla new york times washington post and the night foundation
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:29.840]   to rethink comments on media sites um and grit and i got him greg barber with washington post
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.560]   what he was saying was that it's really about trusted relationships so it's not
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:39.280]   necessarily about the content of the comment or the content of what i'm annotating and reacting to
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:45.280]   um it's a trusted relationships if you look at something like genius there where you do have
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.440]   true annotations where someone can annotate which i do you ever use genius there i don't know what
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:55.920]   it is you don't know genie rapt genius genius oh rapt genius isn't that the one i got genius oh no
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:02.800]   no so now it's genius so there's news genius as well oh and you can put an article or a speech
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:07.040]   or anything up there they also have a means that if you put in i don't know about this did you know
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:12.480]   about this pretty i know about everything i saw the story go by and then i so this is news genius
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:19.600]   so what am i seeing here so this you can take an article a speech a book chapter a song and you
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:25.520]   can truly annotate it hmm and and they've also set up a structure so you could do this on top of a
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.600]   new york times page but the new york times lawyers stop them for now so the example i have of having
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:34.800]   annotated that i forget what i i am one of my german publisher guys you know put up or no
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:41.760]   rubber Thompson from the from news corps put up an anti-dramon rant um and so i could annotate it there
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:47.520]   at rapt genius a genius hmm it's very cool so so there's all kinds of interactivity that can go on
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:54.000]   now my point is um i'm medium alone you have comments you have things you could mark you have
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.480]   responses you have recommendations you know it's a shame because you recommend because it was
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:05.200]   wrapped genius there is a definite urban slant to every single section on here yep but maybe that
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.160]   will over time change i think the idea is really interesting it's really really intriguing i went
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:15.760]   to a meeting run by the pointer foundation or pointer or quid institute it's called institute thank
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.720]   you in new york two weeks ago all in this notion of annotation and try to rethink what comments are
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:27.360]   so ev you know ev who caused blogging and popularized blogging and caused twitter um is reflexively
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:33.440]   i think going back to the value of interactivity but there's still problems to solve with interactivity
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:39.680]   because some people are a holes they also got rid of some of the channels right yeah because they
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:43.040]   thought they were fully a content thing so they were paying for content even before they had the
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:49.600]   monetization ready to do it now jeff do you think that for authors who are writing books and want to
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:56.400]   do it in public uh like uh like uh follow the geeks i think uh is one of one one example is either
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:02.480]   medium or genius a good place to do that to get to solicit feedback really interesting Mike um
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:08.080]   you know dan gilmore put up his almost finished chapters of his last book long ago long before
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:13.520]   these things were there you know in a sense i do that in my blog where i throw up an idea and
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:18.160]   people react to it by the time you have a draft what are you really asking people to do you're
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:23.280]   asking them kind of to copy edit and in fact you can just okay but you're not the reader that
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.440]   isn't really part of the process the readers at the end of the process almost at the very end of
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:33.520]   the process yeah um the other way that people have used rap genius is some authors and and
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:38.960]   singers so singers songwriters have put up stuff so they can explain what they were doing they can
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:46.560]   add they can truly annotate and add information yeah all right i'm downloading a perfect beach
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:53.680]   i say so that you can hear the water lapping uh here nice meditation music he's gonna he's going
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.200]   to his happy place i'm gonna put that on here and then you guys could continue without me
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:06.880]   yeah don't mind us we'll just uh goodbye i'm going to my beach what that is going on with happy place
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:13.440]   uh not yet happy place he's stolen his unhappy place still have to do his configuration for my
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:19.840]   happy place i think you're going to a dizzy place that's a busy a dizzy place i think my phone just
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:26.080]   died your phone went to that's another thing with this is it uh it will kill battery although
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:31.280]   apparently there's a little uh usb port on here so i can just plug it in now medium says that they
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:37.360]   want to be more of a social network and less of a blog posting kind of a stuff is this gonna happen
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:43.120]   mind is this gonna be a good is this a good idea do we want to use medium as a social network it's
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:50.240]   making me think no uh well or maybe if that's fine but that's then not gonna be the place i post
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:55.680]   most most of us mostly yeah oh wow jeff you've like really turned a corner on this a little bit
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:01.120]   yeah it has an impact i haven't i was debating whether you know i was trying to think about writing
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.440]   an email to ever but i haven't i haven't used it enough to get good enough sense so i you this i
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:11.280]   could change my mind again but known to happen but yeah it was it was a peaceful quiet place to
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:18.000]   write in a beautiful presence and feel like it was more polished and and again i'm a fan of
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.400]   their activity i'm a fan of conversation but we got a lot of places for that yeah god knows we have
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.200]   places for that um but i understand the business probably wasn't working people were not spending
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:35.440]   enough time reading good stuff well is minutes read the main metric the right because that was
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:41.920]   mediums metric minutes read tt or total time read total time read is that still the metric as of now
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:47.600]   yes okay okay or is i know i mean you know for me i actually really like the highlights because i
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:54.400]   think that medium encourages folks to write more than they need to like i like whereas with twitter
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:58.800]   you're so constrained you know what i like about highlights is that especially writers who just
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:02.560]   aren't you know have been writing our aren't great writers it just a lot of throat clearing a lot of
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:06.720]   you know ramping up to the point a lot of you know so the highlights is like show me the few
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:13.120]   sentences of this piece that i need to see because and also that's just the way i read online right
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:16.880]   if i'm reading a book i'm going to take time and i'm going to linger what i have trouble with with
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:21.280]   medium i love medium and i've read such great stuff there most of it is in my read it later q
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.800]   um and a lot of it i skimmed because it was it was just too long which i probably i don't know if
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:32.880]   that makes me an intellectual or or ADHD or what but i that's just it's just the reality of how i read
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.560]   you know online so i like highlights for that reason because i kind of get the you know like
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:40.720]   show me the great sentences you know and i feel like the best medium writers just stick the landing
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:46.240]   and it's that last graph you know where they like you know kind of but i mean it's medium the platform
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:50.800]   incentivizes its writers to do that particularly its paid writers right because because paid writers
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.520]   actually get measured on on minutes read right on the yeah i don't want um my friend um
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:00.960]   Debbie glant said one just one day talking to me said you know what my journalist would have said
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:05.280]   another journalist i have to go write a six inch story or a 400 word story she said i think i'm going
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.720]   to write that about six minutes i think i'm going to write that about six minutes i'm going to write
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:15.920]   six minute story the latest piece i wrote on medium uh which was about uh tomorrow land uh as short
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:20.800]   so what happened was except for my plug for my own book at the top which no one highlighted um
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:25.760]   except you first set your mark everything got highlighted yeah so there's there's there's a limit
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:34.480]   to the scale there so over one thing 42 people uh highlighted on one paragraph and so that's that
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:39.280]   tells you something i guess but it kind of it doesn't do that job once it grows to once too many
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:44.160]   people have read it it won't happen right hmm it could be the value you just want it
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:50.560]   mm-hmm right right although i think god bless have he's experimenting sorry yeah i mean this is the
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:54.800]   thing people have such a i think have really high expectations of ev because he's created two you
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:59.280]   know blockbuster products that arguably really changed the web and change publishing and so i
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.760]   think medium is so how high profile and got you know so much user so many users so quickly because
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.080]   just because it was ev and i think that he is a guy who has a lot of money and and can can can
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:13.600]   experiment and is you know of the old web where you did experiment and change things a lot and i
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:18.320]   think he just gets such such scrutiny you know by the media for like figure this out what's the
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:22.960]   plan and i and i think that he doesn't know but he's finding it out as he goes along but because he's
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:30.000]   so high profile it makes it i think that he often gets painted as you know as uh you know lazy
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   billionaire playing around with his property i i don't i actually think he's an incredible product
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.480]   person yes and i think that he should follow his instincts and go and go with it we should give
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:43.760]   him room to do that all right i mean this guy has been designing text boxes for like 15 years you
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:48.720]   know like more than anybody on the web and he's made incredible things that i've benefited from and
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:53.920]   all of us have so like give him the room i it bothers me like the the negativity but bugs me
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:58.800]   uh but i'm still i'm still a little bit circumspected back around media because i agree i
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.280]   absolutely i don't want to yeah i don't want to sound like a negative because i haven't thought
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.120]   of three yet and whenever i do figure out what i think the first thing i want to do is to give
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:09.520]   ev and and the team feedback because i know it'll keep developing i know they'll listen to that do
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:15.200]   you think steven levi is uh regretting uh going all in here no i don't think so i say he gave up a
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.960]   real job at uh wired yeah well why was wired real so like that's interesting like because i
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.360]   kind of think of that way too like i was a little facetious right right right why is writing for
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:30.880]   medium not real i mean i mean part of that is like you know anybody can write on medium uh but he has
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:37.520]   his own magazine art he has his own division of it yeah uh which is what did he say it what did he
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:42.080]   say when you talk to him uh Jeff well he he came to me and i oh i don't like i'm revealing anything
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:46.640]   here but but uh david weinberger wrote a piece where he took 10 questions that were asked of a
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:52.560]   candidate on cnn and 10 that were asked on reddit and just said in parrot dressed and then he asked
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:58.640]   uh you know people do that all the time though like you know i feel like that that isn't a
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:03.840]   that's too hard though he wanted a process so he asked and he'll warn me and others to come in
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:08.080]   and comment because he wanted to kind of really oomph what one was with lots of commenting going
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:12.080]   on and then david came back and responded to them and they wanted to see what a really rich
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.480]   conversation would look like and they and they primed the poem to do that steven was at the heart
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.640]   of that test because steven has the content to do that so when they want to use i mean i think
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:26.560]   what steven i mean my bet is that steven will be around forever as if he wants to because he can
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:31.040]   be the guinea pig for how content can work in new ways there who better to do with than steven
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:37.840]   here's an article steven by the way steven was um at the press party at io where i got to meet
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.440]   larry and sundar which was a thrill um as soon as larry came in steven was just with him
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:49.040]   but i think it was also to kind of make larry at ease but steven is a hell of a journalist he just
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:54.480]   when he has a source and he knows them obviously he just he sticks by there and stays in conversation
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.440]   and learns things it's so it's fun to watch it pro at work isn't it?
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:04.160]   steven so i bet i bet larry and i and i said uh some way to introduce myself because they
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.200]   the p.r people said you want to be larry i said oh yeah of course course course i go up and i
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:12.480]   in the awkward silence moment and i say hi i'm jeff javis i i i i wrote a book called what would
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:18.720]   google do he said oh yes i i remember he said what would google do did you find anything out and
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.760]   i said i i don't know i was open you tell me he said i don't know
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:34.480]   okay your next book could be uh what would larry think that google might do
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:39.440]   like that no surprise that sundar pachai really owned the stage larry didn't show up
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:45.280]   surrogate didn't show up and uh fly in nothing it was a sundar pachai show it's been there's been
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:50.160]   a coup he's really he's consolidated it hasn't he's like he's the guy now yep he seems like he's a
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:54.880]   good guy i think he's good so thoughtful uh doing good stuff he was comfortable up on that stage
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:58:02.480]   yeah he was he's got this you can tell but but he's he's in he's he's in and so many of these shows
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.720]   we've watched there've been no women no people of color no diversity in the audience this is not
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:12.400]   boy google is so diverse well on the stage they still they still are at as much otherwise but on
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:17.920]   stage they were but yeah that's a good point but uh even in the audience look at the audience uh just
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:25.520]   maybe not so many women but but but it was a very international audience i thought which
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:32.000]   was really very international and they have gone to great lengths to uh bringing more women into
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:38.160]   their uh you it's hard to tell because they've gone from almost none right to a small number but
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:44.160]   they they've worked at it pretty hard and they've also worked at it to have upper level level executives
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:49.680]   uh be women and so on but their most recent report actually shows that uh year over year they've
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:56.400]   they've um grown the number of women in technology related positions from only 17 percent to 18 percent
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:02.000]   that's it and for for um african-americans and hispanics they didn't budge the number one bit
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.800]   despite a lot of effort and so they're struggling with that it's hard to do but jina isn't it great
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   to see women on stage uh even if you don't have them on the rank and file it sends a message that
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.720]   in the law i would hope in the long run would improve it apple had a fashion model in stage
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:21.840]   yeah i feel i think the people in stage really reflect the people who are in charge of the various
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:25.920]   divisions i mean they don't they don't choose folks i mean you know samson got actors up there right
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:30.000]   i mean i think i think that's a reflection of who's in charge so that that made me really happy
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.760]   totally subjectively watching the stream i didn't see a lot of women in the audience there was like
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.680]   one row i was like oh they put all the women in that one row yeah that was weird remember we said
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:42.240]   oh there's where they put the women but i did see a photo a friend of mine posted a photo there was
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:47.360]   a line at the women's room at mauscony yes i like to see that's awesome i was almost doing a picture of
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:52.000]   it and i felt that was creepy yeah that would have been a creepy right you have to be a woman in that
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.160]   in that case but how many times if i use the ladies room at mauscony during a big conference because
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:00.240]   there's no one in there is a zone in there no i don't do that i did that too that's what caused the line
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:06.160]   they were waiting for me to get out there was a man in here like what the percentage of attendees
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.840]   were uh uh gender the gender breakdown of the percentage of attendees i remember they mentioned
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.600]   it last year because i looked at jeff and rolled my eyes instead of celebrating this because it was
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.520]   a low number i felt like it was like still like 15 percent or 18 percent they didn't mention the
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:22.000]   numbers this year i don't know i mean i get that it's a short keynote they have to decide what points
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.640]   i would love to i would be very interested to know what the attendee breakdown was but i was really
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.880]   happy to see women on stage we probably will not see women on stage next week at w it's the next
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:36.960]   week right wwdc um and i feel like that's a that's a one one way that google you know explicitly tries
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.600]   to differentiate itself as a company actually android ads it's actually an important way yeah
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.840]   um very important you might say that oh that's just stage managing it's not real but no i think
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.360]   it's it's making a statement i think it makes a difference well i think it also demonstrated
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.680]   they weren't bringing in random women because they were women these are yes women who are heading
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:00.320]   divisions regina dugan a heads a tap i love that i think that's so great that the coolest stuff
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.720]   coming out of google and it's a woman presenting it is fantastic yeah yeah they all had those
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:10.800]   tight they all had titles yeah they weren't actors leading those efforts so that that made me happy
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:18.240]   yeah we kind of did google photos i don't want to go back yeah we did that too bad yeah jr rafael
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:24.240]   has a great uh piece of the six things missing yeah yeah we're sorry i'm sorry
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.320]   luisa came on with
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:35.280]   unlimited free storage yeah that's all you really need to say it doesn't do this i but just but to
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.520]   that point there's actually quite a few things that photos on google plus did including much of the
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.200]   editing right that weren't carried over but i have to think they plan on oh they're that
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.480]   they probably could have been clearer could not have been clearer this is this even though it's
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:52.000]   not a beta it's a released product no no but they're slowly and stuff they know but with their google
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.480]   plus really come on well and well they're too Bradley said i know what he said it's about
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:04.560]   connecting people to their interests so it's going to become a subset of groups so you can see
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.400]   the group's stream is going to be a separate product right so stream hangouts and photos
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:13.360]   are separate products stream google plus is stream is it yes it's the stream bank that's
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:18.480]   real stream so here's what here's what actually happened google came out with google plus they
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.880]   decided it you know back in the day five years ago facebook is running away with all the traffic
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:28.160]   and links and so on and so google said we have to do a social network and so what they did was
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:34.000]   vikindotra was in charge of it and the the strategy was to make google plus the center of
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.840]   everything that google did and it was essentially an unpopular internally and externally political
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:46.400]   move on the part of larry page and vikindotra and they crammed all the stuff in there and everybody
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:52.240]   began to associate the forced integration of different google properties with what google plus
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:58.400]   was as the identity of google plus now they're piece by piece dismantling those forced integrations
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:02.640]   and people are saying oh that means google plus is that no it's just not being forcibly
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:09.120]   integrated it's being disintegrated uh like not let's let's let's do a long bet here yeah and i
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.840]   don't know what i'll bet but since you are even more than me a defender of google plus even though
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:19.200]   we get heckled and laughed at for that especially especially by the way in google crowds i can get
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.960]   a laugh every time i'm gonna google or something i actually like google plus and then they get
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:28.960]   much less because they're tired of putting up with abuse for it
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:35.840]   a year and a half from now yeah well anything recognizable as google plus still be a lot
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:42.320]   i don't know but um i i think yes i think i think it'll continue the thing that i can't imagine
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:48.320]   is for google to have nothing in the area of social networking so they'll either replace it
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:56.560]   again or they'll keep it they not gonna just play this title is photos uh i'm sorry streams
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:02.560]   photos and sharing yes exactly streams matter facebook owns streams pomacardiadps stream started
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.760]   instruments later i don't know what's going on what i was trying to watch it caught pomacardi
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:15.920]   concert like half an hour ago we was like eating lunch watching a concert i love this show go ahead
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.040]   please don't let me interrupt
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:29.760]   you know you know you could take your vr back okay so so so yes so so what google needs a stream yeah
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.600]   is google plus that stream or do you think Bradley and all have something else up their sleeves to get
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:41.520]   our attention for a flow of information or a flow of of attention i think that either one of those is
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:48.240]   a good and and and and likely scenario i think the only scenario that is impossible is for them to
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.040]   have nothing in the area of streams they're going to have a social network or some kind and so they'll
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.200]   either replace it with something they think is better which would be great or they'll keep it
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:02.960]   around forever which would be great in my in my opinion but but really they need streams for
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.920]   lots of reasons that people don't think too much about for example all of the wearable stuff
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:13.200]   that's coming in the future is going to need something like google plus or something that would
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.280]   replace it as the place where you do stuff you saw that with google glass you see it with android
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.800]   where how do you know what the social networks are how do you know what the birthdays are how do
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.600]   you know what you know where do you put the video without touching any buttons or anything i mean
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:31.520]   it has to go somewhere so so i i'm super optimistic about it i think google plus is great they do
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:36.720]   keep improving it a little bit i think it's great that they're taking out hangouts and photos because
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:43.840]   it just makes it easier to share on other platforms and it's you know i i would be i think they keep
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.760]   all of their social networks keep getting better the google plus is a million times better than
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.480]   buzz for example and if they come out with something if they're hatching some new scheme
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:58.160]   it could be really really great and that would be but they're going to get us again the goddess
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:04.080]   and buzz they got us and you know they're really going to be able to get us to to you got to be
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.760]   for a stream to work you've got to be committed to it now google could just make a stream for you
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:14.560]   or me because it knows so much about us yeah maybe that's what now it maybe now is the stream right i
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:21.920]   mean i i don't know does google need a stream why does google need a stream i don't know because i
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:29.600]   think that um it's right question jina but i think that that facebook twitter at all have
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.800]   some extended attention if you look at the amount of attention that we give facebook is
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:39.200]   considerable what does incident articles do it it allows news to integrate to ingratiate itself
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.360]   into that stream that's where their attention is going to be that's where you want to be google
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.840]   doesn't have that google still organizes the page based web mobile is about streams is about it's
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:57.120]   about rolling things um the fact that Bradley has streams in his title says streams matter but
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:02.480]   i think the bigger reason is that that that people i want to join up together in groups to
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:09.200]   to share their passions with each other and google could abdicate its involvement in that
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:14.960]   human activity entirely or they can facilitate in place like google google plus google plus is
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:19.280]   amazing for that sort of thing on thousands of different passions that people have around
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:24.480]   photography and macrame or whatever it is scuba diving there there are rich communities that
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:31.200]   exist even though they're not facebook size numbers uh and i don't see why google would get out of
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.280]   that business it's great for harvesting data about what people are passionate about to serve
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:41.120]   them advertising on other sites fantastic for that theoretically at least it's great for people
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:45.920]   as a place for people to have an intelligent conversation with other people and google can
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:52.000]   like jeff said be involved in those conversations i don't see any reason to not do something like
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.360]   google plus and besides you know people facebook is terrible twitter is very problematic there's
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.360]   got to be someplace you know we're getting to the user interest rather than google's interest
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:08.080]   there has to be a place online where people can go and not be bludgeon to death with advertising
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:13.120]   to not be overwhelmed by trolling and and harassment and hate speech and google plus is the best place
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.760]   for that even though most the journalists on twitter have not recognized the fact that the
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:23.200]   whole trolling harassment hate speech silencing of women issue is a twitter issue it's exclusively
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:28.880]   a twitter issue it really is and nobody seems to mind and and the privacy abuses seems to be
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:34.080]   primarily a facebook issue so there should be a good place i think it's good for google's reputation
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:39.440]   to have the place where you can go and not be harassed by all the things that bother people
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:45.520]   online even though that's only a couple hundred million people and not at 1.4 billion yeah
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.320]   i just i just don't think it's i don't think it's google's core competency like i think google's
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.880]   really good at utilities and not so great at social here's a thing like i look at tons of streams
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.200]   from google i look at my gmail all day long i look at now all day long i mean i'm constantly using
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:04.480]   google it's not like google's lacking for advertising space i mean i i guess and like the reason why
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:08.160]   facebook the reason why the stream matters is you want to hold people's attention but that's so
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:16.640]   that you can advertise to them right i mean that's that's the actual the opposite is true it's exactly
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:23.520]   google's core competency google plus is nothing more than a search engine that's all it is when you
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:32.320]   go to it any stream any circle any community you're looking at a search stream right that's a search
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:39.840]   result that's what google does it's a social search engine that's all google is google plus
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.320]   what i say is not that core competency i'm i'm saying like like they just they don't have the usage
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.280]   on google plus that facebook and twitter and even instagram has like you we've seen we've seen other
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:55.360]   social networks florist usage wise way beyond what google plus has seen right i mean is that that's
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:00.080]   true it doesn't it doesn't have the users that these other networks have i haven't seen any compelling
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:07.680]   evidence that twitter is more active than google plus it among journal among journalists 95 percent
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:12.880]   of journalists and one quarter of the verified people on twitter are journalists like 95 percent
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.680]   of journalists are on twitter and there's very few journalists on google plus and journalists
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.720]   dominate the space about what the conventional wisdom is but in actual fact i think google plus
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:28.400]   is bigger than twitter and more active really absolutely well that baffles me i i don't i
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.640]   well it doesn't feel that because because that's because twitter is an american
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:40.960]   lake it's an american thing at google plus is radically international and if you post anything
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:47.200]   on google plus uh 80 percent of your responses are going to be people who live in non english
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.200]   speaking countries and they're speaking english the second one which is a very internet and you
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.520]   actually interact with international people facebook is international but you when's the last time you
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:01.200]   ran you had conversations with people in egypt and tasmania and other places on on facebook you
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:08.080]   don't you interact with people who are in your own state almost so if google plus's numbers were
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.600]   that good we would have heard about that from state on stage and i know you know what i mean like
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.320]   google will be telling us you know we've got this many and you know million active users in the stream
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.000]   but we never hear those numbers right so when you're when you're not hearing those numbers it
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.640]   it makes you think oh these numbers must not be so great it's super frustrating and i wish they would
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:29.600]   release those numbers but look at twitter go to twitter and you do a big post and look at the data
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.480]   they provide the information that google plus won't and look at the engagement on twitter tweets
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:40.240]   it's pathetic well but that's because the stream is so it's so big and so fast so fast that no
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.560]   individual post is going to get all the attention you get attention on google plus because you're
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:49.440]   speaking in a very small room yeah and of course you're going to get more attention but mike mike's
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:55.360]   right that twitter's small too well twitter's not huge either i agree yeah i think what german
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:01.280]   editors around to various you know of the of the hip media startups in new york and at like three
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:07.120]   spots they said to them you're on twitter you point out to the world they're not right yeah
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:12.320]   remember that you're on twitter they're not and you know i think there's a really good point there
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.560]   that if you want to reach people i i've decided i also helped i visited facebook last week and i
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:22.080]   was blown away by their attitude toward news and everything else and so i'm trying to
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.080]   i do move my twitter feed into facebook because it's convenient
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   um maybe i shouldn't but but i'm trying to post on facebook more and understand it better
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:38.640]   uh and it and it rewards me i get i get interaction there i you know it's it's good so you remind me
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.800]   mike though of somebody like robert scoble who says well you'd like facebook better if you were
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.200]   doing it right or you would like google plus better if you were doing it right i feel like okay maybe
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:52.960]   i'm doing it wrong but how yeah i feel the same i feel similarly yeah how do i do it right what's
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:59.040]   what you know i do you how many people do you circle do i five thousand exactly you're the maximum
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.040]   maximum every time i want to circle somebody i have to go uncircle somebody else i hate the
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.080]   limitation you want as many people as possible in there no i just i just try to circle my peer
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:13.840]   groups so i do uncircle rapidly like if you start seeing a lot of cat pictures from somebody yeah i
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:19.360]   i'm circling block i block i block five people a day easily but you know you don't block them for
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.000]   cat pictures you block them for bad stuff i mean anything that bugs me i block people i mean even
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.040]   if it's like okay here's a cat picture i just don't want to why don't you mute that post or why don't you
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:35.840]   get rid of that person you just block the person i i mostly most of my usage of google plus is
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.200]   uh i create conversations interact with people about the conversations i've created i go to the
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.440]   community medium to do that yeah i could i absolutely could but boy you won't get much
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.840]   interaction there i mean you got more now yeah but that was what you wouldn't get the interaction
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:56.960]   yeah but but i think i think um you know it's it's around it the narrower your passion the more
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:04.240]   valuable google pluses or the more technical so if you're if you're an android fan google plus is
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:10.400]   heaven because there's so many android fans any google any google product is much more popular in
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:16.080]   google but also if you are like really into like a certain species of like tropical fish or something
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:20.400]   like that google plus is also heaven for that too and if you're interested in what's the current
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:26.240]   status of the nation or who just died you'd go to twitter absolutely yeah absolutely
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.440]   and maybe it's just at different use cases yeah absolutely and and again my argument is not that
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:36.480]   everybody should use google plus i happen to love it uh lots of people don't love it it's it's a
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.560]   there's a lot it's a lot and especially journalists don't like it my theory is that you know
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:45.280]   using google plus is kind of like being a journalist itself there's a lot of argument
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.480]   everybody attacks everything you say it's a lot of criticism there's a lot of long winded
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.040]   comments and things you have to interact with it's it's not easy it's not light and fun and
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.320]   frivolous like twitter is twitter's like you can toss up a toss off a sentence and then people
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.080]   joke around and it's fun and it's light and it goes by and the stuff that you miss when you
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.080]   are gone who cares it's gone right or google plus you get in there and you feel like you're
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.720]   mired in the in the in the quick sand of all this conversation there's so much it's too much
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.600]   and so i think you have so many millions of followers well here's the thing that's interesting
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.360]   i have never crossed i've never been able to get past five hundred i'm on the i'm on the secret
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.080]   list of you know the the the the uh recommend it follows us but here's the interesting thing
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:31.600]   it's gone way up lately i'm i'm i think i'm it's growing by like two or three thousand a day
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:37.200]   isn't really using it well i mean it's i'm a more active you are in the smaller the universe the
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:42.000]   more you're gonna get and i'm not as active as i i'd like to since i started here to it i've
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.240]   been trying to be active on all the social networks and so i'm no longer exclusive to google plus i
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.640]   went through a period of being really active hoping to boost my numbers yeah because i thought well
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:55.840]   maybe if i had more followers i'd like it better and it didn't do diddly i got ten thousand more
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:03.040]   users over a six month period i am stalled uh both you and and jina and jeff all have millions of
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.920]   followers do so i don't know what's going on don't you think i know like i'm sorry what's your
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:12.400]   fall it's four it's four and a half million four and a half million yeah and it's nine times more
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:17.280]   than mine but but don't you find that the majority of the twit audiences on google how many twitter
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:23.760]   followers do you have uh 20 is eight thousand i have five hundred seventy thousand yeah so a lot of it
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:28.320]   is what you put in is what you get out maybe that's it maybe that's why i like twitter better than
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.320]   i mean there's stuff i hate about twitter obviously although they do seem to be doing a much
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:38.800]   better job of uh feeling trolls they're doing a much better job than they were a year ago but less
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.280]   of a good job than they were three months ago oh yeah i've noticed that they'd take it for a while
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:47.360]   it was like wow they're getting rid of trolls in like two hours now now they're back to like
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:52.560]   maybe they will maybe they won't maybe it's a few days uh so i think they got they made a big
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.720]   point of it and then they started getting flooded with uh you know but one of the great things like
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.200]   you're using a third party uh app right now i wish google plus would finally open a real
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.440]   api and let third party developers do something interesting it could be better if it would be
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.760]   better if they had an apa yeah so that there's a lot about google plus that really frustrates me and
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:15.280]   that's one of them but um but yeah but i think that you know i think for if you're a tech if you're
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:20.320]   into tech i think google plus is a great place uh and i know that a lot of you know we do this this
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:25.920]   thing on on uh tnt which is like you know how do you watch tnt post a picture well probably it's
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:30.480]   probably 50 50 twitter and google plus and nobody does it on facebook even though facebook is by
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:38.080]   far the social network so the the the technology fans the tech people are not not excited about
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.240]   using facebook so that that's one point to be considered but you know there's a lot of activity
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:48.480]   among our fans on google plus all right uh every time uh you're on we're gonna we're gonna
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.560]   amp talking about google plus so let's stop yeah
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:58.560]   i'm not remeling out of us oh no nobody's yelling at us it's important to do but let's stop by the way
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:05.040]   a little shot in froid apple is recalling the beats pill xl speaker because of fire risk so if
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:12.160]   you bought one of these uh all of them are being returned all of them 230 000 units in north america
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:20.960]   one oh jaff no is that an xl that's not the xl isn't the xl like huge which was the big one
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:27.760]   the big one oh i got the little pill yeah you got the pill but it says the pill xl oh okay i don't
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:34.720]   know what that means it is very good yeah you know i have a confession to make what
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:41.520]   i'm very unhappy about this because i i'm i'm older so i listen to talk and talk you know howard's
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:49.360]   turn and books things like that i'd never you really use spotify oh i started using spotify and it
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:56.400]   it's changing do you see yeah i do see that you believe that far ahead far ahead mongeu had a
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:01.680]   really nice piece in the times today where he was saying that that that that for spotify says genres
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:07.360]   will end his kids young like two and four i saw that piece this week there are nuts about
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:12.000]   simon and garfunkel is it all right it's just music they don't know music music yeah i love it
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:19.280]   30 million songs now it's phenomenal of course apple is gonna google play music isn't
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.760]   nice to see you doesn't have the cure it doesn't have the curated um collections that are as good
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:30.000]   as spotify uh but but i'm you know stern leaves serious and i'm thinking oh i stick around with
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.280]   serious because i get the the radio i think no i'll never know why anybody gets sound like radio
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:41.040]   i just howard's turn that's got to be the really reason because if what you want to do is listen
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:48.560]   to music spotify is infinitely better infinitely better not even close and the quality unspotify
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:52.560]   is infinitely better i don't need do you do you is there a better service in spotify
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:57.360]   your views pandaure a better when we know spotify is the one yeah people find that
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:04.480]   audio and arty is good i like google play this weird place i i i tried to use spotify i don't
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:08.800]   really like that desktop client it's weird i don't really like the facebook integration i was using
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:14.560]   google play music for a while i just canceled my all access uh um you did i wasn't using enough so
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:18.880]   so i sometimes i listen to pandaure but it's got the ads and that's annoying i don't know i'm sort of
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:24.560]   in maybe i should revisit spotify um i'm and then a weird uh i also just listen to a lot of kids
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:29.520]   music all the time because of my daughter and and so i've been coding sort of it well wait a minute
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:36.240]   let me see let me see if it has raffy let me see if baby beluga oh yeah you got raffy but you don't
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:40.320]   you don't do random you just play it over and over and over and over well that's the problem right
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:45.360]   eda says i want i want baby beluga but you can look at all the raffy here you see
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:50.240]   you and you and you could put this on random and you got raffy at the wazoo
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:54.720]   this is yeah i should i should just maybe i should just do that so wait but but it's a
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.720]   subscription i never said actually it's ten dollars a month like everything else is right
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:04.960]   we had a 799 all access i bet you did too because we were early adopters so that's
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:09.360]   kind of an amazing thing that you canceled that one here's one difference that i have to say you
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:15.440]   know i should disclaimer here um the new spotify which is launched right now on ios if you opt in
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:21.440]   and will soon be everywhere includes podcasts includes all of our podcasts and includes video and
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:28.960]   this is uh he also mentions this in the article uh jeff is a very interesting play because uh
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:36.080]   instead of a netflix style video they're basically going to internet video creators and saying
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:44.400]   well how about your shows it's great for us uh i think it's huge yeah i think it is a whole new ball
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:53.920]   game because essentially it's like uh it's netflix for uh internet media and in addition to 30 million
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:22:01.840]   songs so i think it's huge if you have ios go to your settings uh on ios if you have the latest
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:06.560]   version of spotify you should get a banner that says would you like to try the new spotify say
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:13.280]   yes to that and then click shows and you'll see not just our stuff all the stuff and uh what's
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:19.920]   interesting is there been a few people like us who have attempted to take podcasts not to from the
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:24.800]   high and you always made this decision hobby podcast versus what we do to the more professional
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:29.120]   around those people like the nerdist and others who are really creating real you know i think real
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:35.520]   content yep and this is going to be very interesting to see what happens because of this so i confess
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:41.120]   i have a little bit of a dog in this hunt because in spotify with it 60 million subscribers is uh
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.040]   carrying us and that makes a big difference for us i think i believe it was part of the reason i
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:50.480]   tried it uh but it's also well i will visit it you know what's great is the playlist and it was fun
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.640]   because i hadn't used it in a while so i resubscribed and all my playlists were still there and there's
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:23:00.000]   and there's live playlists too so you can subscribe to spotify playlists created by like the bbc
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:06.080]   and they continually update it so here's kind of like pandaure it right here's a question all the
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:11.120]   old days and people used to make mixtapes can you make a mixtape on spotify and share that right you
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:16.720]   can't you bet you can share the link publicly i made a uh for independence day i made a spotify
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:22.640]   playlist a couple of years ago which i shared i think on google plus ironically and uh it's 62
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:30.880]   songs it's four hours of uh this land is your land and uh and and i shared this and uh uh i don't
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:35.360]   see the numbers but there are quite a few people who uh subscribe to this and i think that that's
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:40.960]   one of the things is also very interesting the curation is not just from the pros it is uh from
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:49.520]   anybody you know what uh andi and notco did i i loved this on google plus he asked people to add
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:53.600]   comments to their faith if they had only one song they're kind of like the desert island disc
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:24:00.320]   he got a 154 songs and then one of his a fan's fight oh put it out as a spotify playlist we used to
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:05.520]   put all the music out from the tech guy show that we used in bumpers as a spotify playlist
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:09.520]   so people could listen to the whole song oh cool there's a lot there's audiobooks there's
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.560]   all it's amazing this isn't this is a very interesting play and of course you know what it's
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:18.320]   another stream and i you know what about the economics of it because so far i haven't paid
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.520]   because i'm just seeing what the ad experiences like and unlike radio where you had no verification
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:30.400]   of of what ad was listened to here on a one-to-one basis you know the ad's listened to and the revenue
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:34.480]   share back of that ad i wonder if it's done a lot more than than in the long run than radio
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:42.800]   i can't comment on that uh um we hate that with it i know i don't normally do this kind of
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:49.760]   as we say that never happens i know gina the funniest thing last week is is we had on um uh
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:54.320]   arse ticca ron i'm a great ron i'm a great ron i'm a great ron i'm a great ron i'm a great ron
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.760]   and and and you know he knew some stuff beforehand on a bar go and four people at a row said don't tell
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:07.520]   Leo don't tell Leo so funny on the air he got kind of freaked because we we got near a topic where
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.240]   he knew something we knew that he knew something Leo's asking i'm gonna
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:16.960]   go i love it i love not having it in the days yeah and the funny thing is i don't do ndas as a
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.840]   journalist but unfortunately as i'm also a businessman and as a businessman i know in order to uh do
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:25.280]   some of the business that we do like this spotify thing has been in the works for six months you know
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:38.160]   how hard it is for me not to say anything yeah well and lisa knows more she is very judicious
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:44.000]   about what she tells me because she knows stuff and she says i can't tell you because you are a
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.440]   blabber mouse i like natural share much better you're a professional blabber
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:53.680]   an open book it's like it's endearing it's just like naturally why don't you want to tell people
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:26:00.000]   about stuff i want to tell people about stuff plus i talk for like 40 hours a week i gotta say
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.440]   something i can't say the same old stories over and over again
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:11.600]   knowledge sharing is a noble calling i mean i i think that we this this spotify thing is just a
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:17.680]   little part of what is i'm hoping to change transform everything is what because it's all
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.840]   internet media and internet media needs places people can discover it can play it
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:28.560]   so this is just one we have other deals in place i mean this is i tell us about those
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:34.960]   well you know most of them stitcher you know very well that's been huge for TNT yes because
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:40.400]   stitcher features tech news today fairly frequently yep and we see probably a 50
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:46.960]   bump and downloads because of that yep they're huge huge there's quite a few slacker
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:56.720]   tuning internet radio huge in fact the amazon Alexa yeah if you say listen to TNT or tune into
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:01.120]   TNT it'll do it to tune in yeah the other thing that's great about tuning is they have a live stream
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:07.120]   right which is rare and among these services so i i feel very positive about the transformation
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:13.920]   that's happening and the problem for us is of course discovery yeah we you know we we make the best
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.640]   pop possible product the best product we can and we hope people find it but when people find it i
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.560]   think they like it and i have certain number of people like it and that the key for us is that
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:28.240]   finding it yeah and i what am i going to advertise on a bc that's not going to work yeah all right
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:33.840]   let's take a break come back with more lots more do you want to do a change log i don't think we've
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.880]   prepared one the whole show's kind of a change of life oh yeah yeah sorry about that there i
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.800]   i tried to put one together but there actually wasn't that we know that we wouldn't cover just
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:48.240]   through i/o okay all you pick something because there's some i mean we're only like a third through
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:54.160]   this yep but we got to get rid of jeff when soon oh well my fault my parents flight is a bit delayed

[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:15.520]   what's wrong with a crumb cast one it's pretty good still yeah right right 1.5 billion casts
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.600]   i often choose it as my you know there's you can watch Netflix in a hundred ways but i really like
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:27.200]   the interface between you know using the phone to pick something which is a better way frankly
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:32.160]   than remote on the t's and then casting it yeah and i find myself doing that more and more as more
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:37.920]   and more apps support it yeah that's right yeah so i really like that they they quantified it as
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:44.320]   in touches i thought that was a cool or taps it was either taps or touches yeah but they're basically
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:48.800]   saying casts right but it but it was like you know it was a very clear visual like someone pressed
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:55.840]   this button and with HBO now coming to them the apple exclusive ran out um i think you're gonna
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:02.880]   i feel like you're gonna see uh you're gonna more and more stuff and eventually it's just gonna be
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:09.680]   uh you you just have crumb cast that do they they uh do they build into TVs now you don't have to
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:15.520]   buy the little dongle i think some TVs have it oh i didn't i didn't know that i think that some TVs
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:20.560]   have yeah they announced a few api changes too like you can queue up things to cast so you're watching
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:25.840]   one thing you can't have another oh playlist oh that's playlist yeah um multiplayer gaming a second
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:31.280]   screen so like you can you can make your app use the tv as a second screen so if your if your device
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:37.920]   was a remote control uh the the screen would be a second screen and yeah multiplayer game power so
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:43.680]   really kind of turning it into a game console yeah and and sony and sam song and other TVs do have
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:49.600]   it built in uh and uh yeah why not anything with android tv in it would have crumb cast right as
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:54.480]   well right uh who's doing android sony is it sony now that's doing android tv and all there but
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:59.280]   i can't remember i believe sony is i think so yeah i think so i'm excited about android tv
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:06.640]   is that gonna be the shield looks really that that's they handed that out believe it or not if you
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:12.240]   went to the right session at google i uh the day before it all started yeah oh yeah it was on the
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:18.560]   wednesday uh for what i understand it's sessions on a wednesday until until uh or invidia had uh
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:24.240]   their own thing going on the prior i want to buy that shield that looks like the right android tv
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:30.000]   yeah it's a little more expensive but i agree it's the right one and this isn't the flip up uh
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.160]   no this is this whole thing this is a separate okay i set talk it's a new product from uh
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:40.560]   invidia running on their you know that that k what is it k1 or x1 processor the k1 processor
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:47.680]   um uh they're not selling that on the i'm looking on the play store to see they have crumb cast
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:54.560]   nexus player gamepad yeah 200 bucks yeah but you know really um yeah that's twice as much as a
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:33:02.080]   roku for instance boy it's a lot more capable well and for what is it 50 bucks x-tray i came
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:08.320]   up to storage yes right 500 gigs of storage which what would you do with that i mean that's
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:14.160]   that's a lot of storage but i mean when you're talking set top uh you know um entertainment
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:20.160]   the nexus player comes with what 16 oh so you would put apps on here yeah so that would be you
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:24.160]   know apps and i imagine you could do offline storage if you're meeting that stuff too
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:29.920]   200 bucks for the 16 gigabyte version it's hard to know whether you need the 500
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:39.520]   but the 500 is 299 and it's available released June 12th uh and you could get the the 16 gig
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:48.320]   version today um so tempted it's amazon prime and everything it's just it's just there all
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:56.160]   all by me now 4k support with a button that's easy to do what do you want to do one quick voice
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.000]   friends yo
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:06.080]   you've got a well you would get the 500 gig if you were gonna game for sure yeah but i don't know
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:12.640]   if i'm gonna game what kind of what apps have to sit little click please stop it stop it stop it
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:21.040]   stop it why is it showing that i can also put a micro SD card in there is it support micro SD
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.720]   uh good question yes it does
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:31.600]   so you could add maybe you could add some other 28 gigs of SD card is what the door is saying so
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:36.560]   yeah yeah why why so maybe i'll get the 16 gig and if i feel like i need more down the road i can
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:41.760]   always do that i have micro SD lying around all over the place it's like to be better to add
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:45.600]   oh and you can add other usb storage all right then then get the 16 gig version and you can just
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:51.280]   put it right hard drive or something okay i'll just uh let me just click buy now oh sorry whoops
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:57.920]   it happens buy now happens there's a controller
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.360]   because it comes with i believe it comes with one controller yes and one remote and you can buy
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:09.440]   extras uh or it comes with a controller or a remote i can't remember but you have an android
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.520]   door watch you don't need a controller can i do it with an android where watch you can i could
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:19.200]   talk to my tv with my watch i think you i don't know about talking but so yeah the shield android tv
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:26.160]   comes with one controller so i don't believe it comes with the um the remote or remote well i'll
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:36.160]   let you know when i get it on friday ha okay that's all it took all it took i got a problem i
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:41.840]   admit it i got a problem now they talked about loon and how well loon's doing it's nice
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.720]   you know people were people were cheering for a lot of the facts that they trotted out about
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:52.960]   loon and those are old facts that they didn't announce anything new new they're doing better with
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:58.560]   how many days the balloons can be in in the air and stuff they were shattering records
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.920]   a year ago on that yeah so but it's you know it's everything that you know the mesh networking all
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:10.080]   the rest is is essentially what they've been uh talking about for many months so it wasn't a lot
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:17.840]   of new stuff it just they're doing a little better all the time i guess patriot act kind of uh extended
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:22.720]   but kind of not as bad well i think this is really big news i think it's good i think yeah it was great
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:29.600]   and i think that uh dammit uh at worst don't as a hero he's a worse and lower yeah and he's changed
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:37.440]   the discussion as much as well as much as anything yep and i think the demagogues and
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:42.880]   congress can't have it both ways they can't voluntarily choose to change us law based on what
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:50.000]   snowden revealed and also say he's a traitor you know and and you know court cases are citing you know
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.320]   explicitly saying this is edward snowden you know caused this otherwise we wouldn't be fixing this
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:03.280]   problem so i think i think that anybody who who calls him a traitor in congress and and also votes
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:08.160]   to change the law based on which they wouldn't have done if they didn't know what he revealed
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:14.320]   uh they're just full of crap i do it needs some help though because like ours technica said what
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:20.800]   the patriot act it's been extended so snooping continues let the snooping resumes senate revised
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:25.680]   patriot act surveillance measures the new york's time said u_s_ surveillance in places 9/11
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:33.440]   sharply limited which is it yeah it this the cover has been confusing did we win or did we lose
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:38.880]   did we lose yeah like what happened so we won so they so look the patriot act was going to get
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:44.400]   extended in some form or fashion yes exactly yes i mean yes the clock ran out but that didn't mean
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.800]   the senate then says okay we we give up they're gonna they're going to continue on the house had
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:57.600]   passed uh that what was the u_s_ uh freedom act usa freedom act yep which did sharply limit the kind of
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:04.800]   phone snooping they could do the the mass collection of phone data right uh with with some additional
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:11.920]   checks and balances but did allow it to continue so when the patriot those sections the three sections
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:17.920]   of patriot act expired including 215 that actually did end phone surveillance well but the bill the
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:22.880]   u_s_a_ freedom act reinstitute institute with better protections exactly specifically the
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:28.800]   biggest protection is that instead of the n_s_a_ having physical a possession of an unfettered
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:34.880]   access to these uh the the metadata phone metadata where somebody's like oh my wonder what my ex
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:39.840]   girlfriend's up to and they could just type it in and get the you know get get information they now
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.880]   that that data is now in the hands of the of the telecoms and when the n_s_a_ wants to get access
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:50.320]   to it they have to go through a procedure and get judges approval and all the rest so that's a big
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:56.240]   deal in that one area of mass surveillance and it's a it's an upgrade it's an improvement
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:02.960]   uh but still the the you know by and so now the phone company but i think that it's less of a
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:09.040]   i i think that there's been so much press since the since the edward snowed revelations that
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:15.600]   that any terris worth is salt at all is not going to be uh it's not going to be ignorant about the
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:20.160]   collection of mass metadata so i think that i think it's that the i think it's been spoiled already
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:26.000]   for the n_s_a_ yeah and so i don't think this is a you know anything worse for them in any event i
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.040]   think that the benefits are still there for them man mitch mcconnell of course
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:37.200]   said one more tool has been taken away from those who defend our country every day
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:44.720]   uh oh he lost well he lost but but he also didn't really lose it in fact i almost feel like
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:55.200]   i'm a cynic he yeah he he played the game or we want to hold on to this they got what they they got
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:58.640]   there's still plenty of authority yeah all there's still plenty of things for them to
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.560]   and and you know the phone company is still holding on to all those data it's not like nobody's collecting
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:09.120]   your data yeah they're collecting it uh it's not like those judges on the fiza quarter that you know
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:13.280]   protect it's standing up for our right sorry i don't think well but now they have to listen
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.760]   at least listen to an outsider now more of that can be made over there it was baby steps
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:25.920]   doesn't it yeah if i were if i were john c de vorek i'd probably say yeah it's all it's all
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:32.400]   theater by the way speaking of security theater you saw the feds tested the tsa yeah trying to get
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:39.520]   guns and bombs passed them 95 percent got by i saw a lot of photos that people took they they
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.360]   received the news while they're sitting in the airport airport waiting for a flight i think
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:49.520]   an outbreak so essentially much like the mass collection of phone data the tsa is completely
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:55.200]   ineffectual yes well maybe they catch one in twenty guns they're the perfect government program
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:41:01.360]   they're completely ineffectual and super expensive and annoying as heck yeah expensive and time
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:07.440]   wasted too yeah like for for consumer for the economy my sister who's accompanied my parents
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:13.440]   up here for our daughter's graduation she she texted me just a little while ago my father carries a
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:20.400]   money clip that he's had for you know 50 years his little tiny blade and money comes that big right
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:27.200]   16 bucks he had a male back to himself so he's grumbly don't play up and and that's the point
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:32.480]   is that the tsa found his freakin money clip but the guy with the gun went right through because
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:38.480]   exactly it's like right my my 90 year old father in a wheelchair with a money clip we got him
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.840]   got it and it's even worse than that um there there've been studies that have found that
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:48.480]   um because of the number of people who've avoided flying and instead drove
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:54.000]   because of all the hassles of security around flying the number of people who have died in car
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.880]   accidents that would be no is higher than the number of people who killed on 9/11 so so all of
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:04.560]   the security theaters killing people at a higher rate than the terrorists are oh my oh that is
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:12.080]   the most depressing thing i've heard but don't bring that bottled water under the flight yeah
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:17.600]   drink that breast milk just prove it to us come on just have a sip come on i love there's this
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:23.120]   wonderful cartoon i don't recall unfortunately who who the cartoonist was but basically they said
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:28.320]   oh this this bottled water could be an explosive i'm just going to put it here in this bin full of
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:33.680]   other potential explosive surrounded by hundreds of people yeah that's a good place to stick it
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:42.640]   but just um for the tsa people watching the homeland security officials who are watching this show
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:47.440]   i love it keep up the good work you're doing a great job thanks i'll be on the plane next week
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:51.520]   keep it all you know i do have to say i do have to say the poor guys were there on the front line
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.840]   you know and and i don't want i'm not going to i got to go to the airport so i'm not going to get
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:02.640]   a 9/11 riff but there is some level that we do need and i you know do salute and help me in some
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:06.800]   extent we know you know we're not willing we know what it needs to be done but we're not
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:13.040]   willing to do it because ll does it and it's a personal questioning of everybody before they
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:17.040]   get on the plane yeah and uh with with truly well-trained
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:22.000]   professional security professionals but we're willing to take off our shoes but
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.200]   i'm not sure i you know i mean we're all every country in the world will eventually be israel
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:32.480]   yeah we're all we're all team israel they're they're way ahead of the curve there on all that stuff
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:41.680]   uh so sorry i love the tsa actually i do at least i left her ipad on a plane we had gotten out of the
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:46.640]   by the way this is not the right word the word you use sanitized area is not the correct word but
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:54.640]   can you stop it it's not sanitized in any way but we exited these two nauseous makes me feel better
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:44:01.520]   that it's clean no it's not we left the sanitized area and uh lisa wanted to get her ipad because
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:08.000]   she knew where it was and they said no no you're you're now in public and the airport's shutting
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.160]   down so all the tsa agents were going home so there's no way to go through security and a very kind tsa
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:17.120]   agent said all right all right hold on let me let me go back to the gate and see if you left it
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.480]   there went went back got it brought it to her she gave him a big hug and kiss so they're nice
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:26.400]   i'm sure that was a violation of the law and i bet you anything he could have lost his job for
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:33.040]   doing that yeah yeah uh i said i would let you all pick stories anybody i think we've covered it i
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:36.880]   i'm i think we're missing we haven't covered you actually covered most of it we skipped around
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:40.080]   but i mean we didn't talk about android pay a whole lot but there's not really a whole lot to say
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:44.160]   exactly we already have android pay it was called google wallet now google wallet will be
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:50.800]   peer-to-peer payment like venmo and and and android pay will be google wallet right and a story yep
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:54.960]   okay that's yeah that that's a good story i like google wallet keep doing it

[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:47.280]   something we'll talk really quiet it's very slow quiet i once interviewed kenice bran
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:54.640]   author great actor and in the movie uh henry the fifth he plays the king and he talks like that
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:01.760]   and i said kenice why are you talking like that and he said because the king doesn't have to
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:08.560]   talk loud in fact the quieter the king talks the more the courtiers listen and that's true of tim
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.680]   cook as well true for tim cook as well jina japanese from uh smarter where dot i'm sorry

[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:38.000]   actually have um a readiness assessment to see whether or not you're you know you're kind of
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.760]   where you need to be and and this isn't kind of a zero to hero thing this is like you have to have
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:45.280]   a little bit of coding experience you have to know how to use get if they understand objectorian
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:49.680]   programming but this particular nano degree and it's a big commitment it's like 10 hours a week
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:54.640]   for nine and 12 months but at the end i mean the the goal is to get you to be a hireable
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:52:00.720]   android developer um that's the that's the nano degree that they announced but udacity also
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:06.000]   just has a ton of other totally free android courses and free courses that can get you kind of
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.480]   from you know starting to be a beginner off the ground and it really looks like they're kind of up
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:15.440]   on with this partnership with google up on kind of the latest and greatest of android development
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:21.840]   techniques and tools and stuff so um i just just looks really cool if you've ever you know been
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:25.440]   interested in or wanted to become an android developer definitely check out the udacity offerings
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:30.240]   you don't even have to do the the supercharged you know 12 month nano degree that costs 200
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:35.360]   dollars a month there's a lot of ton of free material there too that can get you started so um yeah
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:38.720]   it's it's pretty cool and if you want to do the readiness assessment it's just a few questions
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:42.480]   and i'll kind of tell you oh yeah yeah it looks like you know you're right for this or maybe
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:45.840]   you should check out some of this other material that's more for beginners or for people who have
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:51.680]   less time or or whatever so i was really impressed with it when i checked it out and i apologize because
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:58.400]   i mocked it because of the name during our live stream i said when's the pico degree and the femto
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:04.320]   degree it minimizes it yeah it does minimize it's i apologize well months of 10 hours a week like
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:08.160]   this now degree just like a bet no no that was maybe a marketing mistake on their part
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:12.960]   nano-grese seemed like a bad uh yeah a number of people wrote to me and said this is a great
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:18.240]   program and i'm really benefiting and you know i had to take a lot of courses and it's by no means
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:27.360]   you know a diminutive degree it's a good degree so i apologize uh good on you nano degree
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:34.240]   and do you go to udacity.com is that the place to go to find out more yeah i think it's udacity
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:37.680]   a com slash maybe slash goo less you probably should be on the front page
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:43.680]   since it this was a big announcement um put it on the put it on the front page i wonder if i'd
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:49.040]   qualify i should take the qualification because i have no training i'd like to find i love programming
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:52.400]   i want to do it yeah there's a couple of questions like hey look at these two methods which one do
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:56.560]   you think would work just kind of to get a sense of where you're programming right and stuff so yeah
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:03.920]   it's worth worth taking leo you need to take the femto degree there's this like they have this little
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:07.200]   video of these two folks saying you know there are gonna be times when you're getting it stuck and
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:10.800]   your code's not gonna work and it's gonna be really frustrating and that doesn't mean that
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:14.880]   failure is happening that's what just learning feels like i mean it's funny they have to do that
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:19.840]   yeah but that's right but it's true it's really true most of my workday is spent feeling extremely
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:23.440]   frustrated because the thing i'm trying to get to work doesn't work and that is just a part of being
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:27.920]   a goater so i really like their approach to it i felt like they couched it and very uh they
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:33.360]   they explained it very well mike elgan you have a tool or a tip or anything you'd like to share with
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:38.480]   us i do i have a tool that was inspired by your clothing the great suspender great
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:41.760]   suspender wait a minute i get a look it up here this has actually been around for a couple of years
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:45.520]   but i don't think enough people know about this and i certainly didn't know about it until very
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:51.200]   recently maybe three weeks ago here's what it does we all know that chrome is a pig yes and gobbles
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:57.600]   up tons of memory especially if you if you have uh if you have a tab addiction like i do i i typically
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:04.400]   run 20 30 40 50 tabs open at once and it just it just gobbles up memory and slows my whole system
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:09.440]   down so what the great suspender does is it removes the content of tabs out of memory and
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:16.160]   retains the tab so for example if you've got 30 30 tabs open you can set a timer for example i
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:21.200]   i set mine for 15 minutes after 15 minutes the tab goes to sleep essentially and it's removed from
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.400]   memory and so the ones that i'm actively using the tabs that they're alive they're just normal tabs
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.400]   but the ones that i've been neglecting for more than 15 minutes are removed from memory and the
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:36.720]   performance is amazing both my wife's uh macbook and mine we're both using it and we don't even
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:43.440]   use our fans anymore no fans never kick in anymore wow it's the most fantastic and it's very flexible
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:48.800]   too there there are other extensions like this but this is the most flexible one because you can
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:55.200]   say okay on this website never suspend this website on this particular tab i will leave this open for
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:00.640]   now and or you know unsuspend all tabs suspend all you can do anything and then here's the other
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:06.400]   good part when you've got let's say you've got three tabs open and ten tabs that are suspended
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:11.680]   when you shut down your system when you come back and boot it back up it's still in that state those
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:16.320]   ten tabs are still suspended and those three tabs are still active it's really great you can just
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:21.120]   install the uh extension and you forget about it and you're just going to have better performance
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:26.160]   that's sweet yep or you could just close tabs you could but that's not going to happen Leo we both
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:30.880]   know that's not going to happen i close tabs i you know it's so weird because you see people like
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:37.600]   you and uh yo god gibson yeah chris apparently our intern which is they have you can't even read
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:43.120]   the tabs because there's so many of them they're the size of of a fingernail yeah all across your
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:46.800]   page you can even see the little speaker to know what the no you don't know what the hell it is yeah
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:52.400]   once you can't see the speaker um uncles and tabs yeah i'm cleaning that okay i just think like well
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:58.240]   i just when i'm not look at my tabs i got two there's another extension called one tab that will take
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:03.360]   all of your open tabs and it will put them all as links in a single tab i'm doing a show here and
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:08.160]   i only got one tab as i do news stories i closed the tab when we're done with that no no we Leo you
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:12.160]   and i have the same tab personality i think the tab management is probably really expressive what
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:17.040]   kind of person do you want in any in any cause you're cabs if you're gonna have a tab you're gonna
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:24.160]   use the tab close it up you're fantastic i love tabs i guess if you want to you want a cool tab
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:32.000]   trick uh wonder list vunder list from zex vunder kins kinder yes in berlin we just sold to
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.640]   microsoft they you and i uh who was it no because jina has her own to-do list program i use i should
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:45.040]   use to do text i love it i've used them i remember the milk uh any do but i started using vunder list
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:49.040]   because it was very very cross-platform including this it has a chrome extension that when i open a
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:54.560]   new tab my to-do list pops up that's a good way to make sure you do your to-do list right and you
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:58:00.320]   can add to list there so uh vunder list i don't know what microsoft's gonna do with it but they
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:05.200]   but they bought sunrise and they bought a complex and they didn't kill either of them so i'm hoping
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:10.800]   hoping that that won't go away because it's a really nice to-do list almost as good as jina
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.360]   tripannies to do that test no i think it's a little more user friendly than having to use
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:21.360]   the command line to add to-do's to you but that's why i like user.text it has it's a command line to
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:27.520]   do list now that's hot yeah that's the new hotness let's make this as hard to use as possible i've
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:32.400]   been using the emacs to do and organize or this great pimp and emacs you know it's just great
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:39.280]   uh jina thank you so much please come back absolutely i will thank you this is a lot of fun
