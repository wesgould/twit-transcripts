[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.640]   episode 12 for October 17, 2009.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.040]   The big butt at the end of the long tail.

[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.960]   We couldn't do Twig without it.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.840]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.600]   to show that covers Google and cloud computing.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.360]   I want to be a great pains to mention that,
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.480]   because occasionally something happens.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.440]   It's outside the Googleverse.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.240]   No, really?
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.080]   It's been--
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.880]   What is Google as well?
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.880]   What's it like?
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.320]   Google is life.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.320]   What is it they say?
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.820]   Right.
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.680]   Frank Sinatra.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.440]   It's Frank Sinatra's world we just live in.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.800]   It's Google's world we just live in.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.200]   That's Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.840]   He's both today, both impotent and incontinent.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.960]   So that's exciting.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.980]   Thank you.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.880]   That's the most intro I've ever had.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.040]   And if you're wondering why I said that, read Jeff's blog,
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.040]   Jeff, I admire you.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.120]   I mean, I'm really glad you posted that,
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.000]   because most of us guys are going to go--
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.640]   it's a very high percentage, but eventually get
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.320]   prostate cancer.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.520]   Yeah, well, but it's good to raise awareness, I think.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.360]   So I applaud you for being so open.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.880]   Do you have second thoughts about that?
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.120]   No, I don't at all.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.720]   Not one bit.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.600]   The comments are the most gratifying part.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.320]   People coming in and saying nice things like that,
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.600]   but also sharing their experience with prostate cancer
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.280]   or going off to get tested.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.760]   You know, that's the thing about online.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.640]   It's a chance always to coalesce.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.240]   And so you do something public, and people coalesce
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.920]   around that, and that's the magic of the internet.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.200]   Yeah, you have the conversation.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.840]   I was at Blog World, and a couple of people came up to me
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.920]   and said, please thank Jeff for that post.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.360]   Well--
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.040]   Plus it was the best headline I ever
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.600]   could have written "The Penis Post."
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.760]   It's all about the male member.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.920]   OK.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.400]   Thank you.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.160]   Gina Trapani may disagree, actually, on that.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.640]   Let me talk about it segue.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.360]   Gina Trapani, she's giggling now.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.880]   She's--
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.120]   I love her.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.400]   She's actually--
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.800]   she's turning bright red.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.760]   Aren't you cute?
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.160]   I didn't need blush today.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.800]   You didn't.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.440]   Gina is the creator of Life Hacker, the poster
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.760]   at smarterware.org.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.200]   And of course, a great friend of the show
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.240]   and of Google-ish stuff all over.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.840]   Hello.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.760]   Glad to have you on.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.280]   And a special guest today.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.440]   I'm so-- we've been trying to get a SEVA for--
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.680]   it's practically since the show began.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.760]   And so I'm so glad to get you on.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.920]   Now I'm going to try to say this right.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.880]   SEVA Vaginathan.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.520]   That's good.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.880]   Yeah, I did it right.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.440]   He is the author of the Googleization of Everything.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.840]   And you can find him at Googleizationofeverything.com.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.680]   And you're a professor.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.120]   Zachary--
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.000]   Yeah, something else.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.240]   He professes.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.600]   Where do you profess?
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.040]   That's a good question.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.160]   No, actually, I'm at the University of Virginia.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.440]   And I'm in the Department of Media Studies.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.520]   I also do one of my classes in the law school.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.200]   But yeah, it's a really sweet place to work.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.240]   And it's been a nice couple of years I've been here
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.600]   after moving from New York.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.000]   One of these days, I'm going to get the two professors,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.560]   Jeff Jarvis and SEVA here.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.040]   And we'll do a show on the end of the university
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.720]   with Don Tapscott.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.400]   Because that's a very controversial subject.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.960]   I was talking to Don earlier this week.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.880]   And we just-- we practically started a firefight
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.680]   in the chat room because we have a number of professors
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.240]   in the chat room.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.760]   And that's a good subject.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.280]   But we'll table that for the nonce
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.080]   because we've got to talk about Google.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.920]   And because SEVA's here, I think we
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.160]   should talk about the Google Book Deal, which is now
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.800]   apparently not a deal at all.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.880]   First of all, you got your wave invite yesterday.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.080]   You know, late to the party.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080]   Late to the party.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.240]   I have a good friend who was able to get me one.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.680]   Of course, I signed up to be on the list long ago
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.880]   when I first heard about it.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.040]   Very excited about the potential of it.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.160]   I mean, it's an amazing idea.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.720]   I know-- I guess Gina has better observations than I do.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.040]   I've only been messing with it for a couple of hours.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.520]   So I mean, I have--
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.400]   Gina's our resident expert.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.560]   But I'm just-- I'm excited to be part of the club.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.600]   How's that?
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.880]   You're now in the club.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.520]   And you're not late to the party because the party really
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.520]   hasn't even started yet.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   I mean, it's very--
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.020]   It hasn't.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.000]   It's not late at all.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.080]   It's still really early.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.720]   So-- but we spend a lot of time talking about wave.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.600]   And I appreciate it, by the way.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.200]   I want to thank you.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.040]   I wasn't here last week.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.640]   I want to thank you, Jeff Jarvis, for doing the show last week.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.520]   Did you mention wave at all last week?
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.920]   We forgot, didn't we, Gina?
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.720]   I think I got a little bit in about wave.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.440]   I think I got in one week in wave.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.960]   One week in wave.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.080]   That's a new feature we now have--
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.600]   Gina has inaugurated on us.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.240]   We can wave.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.320]   This week in wave.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.240]   Twill.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.760]   Twill.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.640]   The very, very good show.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.000]   It's like the confusion level from 0 to 10.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Or is it just--
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.440]   We could do that.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.240]   We could have red, orange, green, and yellow.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.400]   We could have a little home terror alert, a home wave alert.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.800]   While you're on it, there's a great link on the front feed
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.960]   to a Samuel L. Jackson rides Google Wave.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.040]   It's hilarious.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.240]   And it uses a single line of Jackson blinds from movies
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.720]   to demonstrate the power of wave.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.600]   It's not safe for listening to run your kids.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.120]   It's a family room, but it's hilarious.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.960]   I could play a little bit of it and we could just bleep it.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.800]   But I think there wouldn't be anything left if I did that.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.920]   No, there's plenty.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.760]   That said there's plenty there.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.720]   It's OK.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.320]   You kind of have to see it though, right?
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.520]   Because it's like the wave interface.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.880]   Yeah, it's visual.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.680]   Yes.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.720]   Now, unfortunately, it's been pulled off of YouTube
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.600]   by the rights holders, I guess.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.280]   But--
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.040]   Rap.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.000]   But somebody told me that it's still showing somewhere else.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.240]   But I get this--
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.760]   You see him?
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.360]   Right holders.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.920]   Right holders.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920]   He's having no fun.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.760]   No sense of humor.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.280]   Copyright law for crying out loud.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.040]   What good is that?
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.160]   This is the modern age.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.160]   We don't need copyright.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160]   We've got Google.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.440]   So what happened to the Google Book Deal, Siva?
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.800]   Was it the Department of Justice's brief that really kind
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.120]   of threw the whole thing into the trash?
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.480]   That seems to be the inside story, the conventional wisdom
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.960]   anyway, that once the Justice Department raised
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.240]   some very important questions, especially
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:21.840]   about competition, it just became too much of a hassle
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.800]   to go through at this point, to go through in October.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.120]   I'm sure the parties hope that they
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.040]   can iron out some of the fairly big issues
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.280]   that the Justice Department had with the agreement.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.120]   But I'm doubtful that they can actually salvage it
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.760]   and keep all the parties happy at this point.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.200]   To do it in time, at least to do it by November,
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.120]   no settlement is ever really over.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.160]   They just ask the judge to keep deferring and deferring
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.080]   and deferring until they get everything hammered out.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.760]   But the Justice Department isn't the only party
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.720]   with an interest and a complaint.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.080]   You're still going to have to deal with the German government,
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.280]   the French government.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.760]   You're going to have to deal with the European Union.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.280]   You're going to have to deal with any number of other parties
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.080]   with issues.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.320]   You have to deal with potential competitors in Microsoft,
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.040]   Yahoo, for instance, or the Internet Archive, which
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.520]   has major issues with the competitive advantage that
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.920]   this presents.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.400]   Google, so with all of that, it just
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.320]   seemed like this was one of those rare moments
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   when Google took a step beyond its foundation of trust out
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.000]   there.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.160]   And it's been a very weird time.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.760]   It's been nearly four years building toward this moment.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.960]   When they announced the settlement,
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.040]   I think everybody was just blown away, first of all,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.560]   by how detailed and bold the settlement was.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.160]   And I don't think anyone expected
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.040]   to have that level of detail come out quite so quickly.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.200]   And almost immediately, people sort of raising very serious
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:11.760]   issues about it.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.080]   So I mean, that was kind of the problem,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.400]   was the settlement was between the authors
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.480]   killed the publishers and Google.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.520]   And there were 800 other parties that weren't really included,
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.920]   right?
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.200]   Yeah, and I mean, there are two problems.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.800]   One is the sort of micro-legal problem, which is that.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.280]   There are so many other parties with a stake in the business
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.960]   and a stake in the culture that didn't really
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.600]   have a stake in the settlement.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.200]   That's problem number one.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.600]   Then there's the sort of macro-policy problem,
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.160]   which is that this settlement essentially
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.200]   set up a rights registry, which has two implications.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.040]   One is it's a formality in copyright law in practice.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.200]   And having a formality of that magnitude in copyright law
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.080]   in practice come out of a class action suit and a settlement
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.400]   for a section suit, that's totally revolutionary.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.520]   Well, that's one of the DOJ's big complaints,
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.800]   is this should not be--
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.000]   this is making-- in effect, making law,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.400]   making copyright law in a class action lawsuit.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.800]   This is something Congress should have dealt with.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.320]   You know, the funny thing is--
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.760]   so here's the thing, like, OK, Google's
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.080]   this major presence in DC now, right?
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.680]   They've managed to actually assert themselves
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.520]   as a political actor.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.920]   They have important people listening to their interests.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.920]   They have a lot of money to throw around.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.800]   And the old-fashioned way to get something changed in Washington
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.880]   or in the country is to make a lot of donations
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.320]   and throw a lot of parties and take Congressman
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.000]   Anjungkits and get your lobbyists to write the bills
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.640]   that they send through.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.480]   Had they done it the old-fashioned way,
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.080]   and actually tweaked the laws just enough
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.560]   to be able to allow this sort of thing,
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.040]   it would have been kosher, right?
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.320]   But what you end up with by going through the courts,
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.880]   it ends up being a really troublesome process
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.040]   in a completely different way, you know?
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.480]   In a way that's sort of more transparent,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.960]   but not quite democratic and certainly not in line
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.160]   with how we usually make law and policy in this country.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.240]   And let's remember, this was going to be--
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.960]   had it gone through a revolutionary model
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   for content distribution and a huge change in how libraries
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:39.000]   operate and a huge change in the ways that copyright actually
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.920]   works for printed materials.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.320]   And all of this came out of a settlement
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.360]   among a very small group of people.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.920]   And that's just not how we're supposed
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.440]   to make law in this country.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.760]   Siva, I think you would stipulate your honor
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.880]   that trying to get books digitized is a good thing.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.560]   I'm curious to hear if you have a vision of how you think it
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.360]   should be done.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.240]   How can we get--
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:05.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.520]   Sure, sure, sure.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.920]   The hard way and the expensive way, how's that?
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.840]   [LAUGHS]
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.680]   Look, this is a monumental task.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.040]   And the goal is something that has the potential
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.840]   of making a tremendous difference in a lot of people's lives.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.520]   And that's one of the reasons I think
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:29.440]   it's a great idea to get stuff accessible, to get stuff
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.520]   preserved right.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.480]   But let's remember that Google has very little experience
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.000]   dealing with issues of preservation-- actually,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.560]   no experience dealing with issues of preservation.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.520]   Google has no real good record dealing
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.120]   with complex issues like metadata.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.080]   And you have so many different quality issues on the way.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.600]   Now, if you really want to do this,
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:00.880]   you have to step back and say, who's really on board?
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.760]   And I think we should say that most people would be on board.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.040]   And if that's the case, let's figure out
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.360]   the best possible way to do it with the biggest input,
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.000]   the biggest splash, focusing on preserving this archive
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.240]   for 50, 100, 200 years, not focusing
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.360]   on delivering a handful of poorly scanned pages
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.880]   to people within 24 months.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.880]   I think that the priority has been on speed and size,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.240]   which is how Google does everything.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.880]   That was Jeffery Numbers complaint.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.320]   Yeah, that was Jeffery Numbers complaint.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.080]   Yeah, that was two important projects
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:42.680]   to leave to one company to do so quickly and frankly,
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.080]   with such low quality.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.840]   Who pays for that?
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.080]   Well, we should actually pay for it.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.840]   If we want it, we should pay for it actually.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.640]   I mean, I don't think that's a wacky idea.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.640]   We as in taxpayers, we as in users.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.000]   That's how I would prefer.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.520]   I would prefer if the Library of Congress
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.480]   took the lead coordinating a scanning and indexing project
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.320]   by all the major university libraries in this country
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.960]   and some of the major public libraries in this country.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.360]   And we went about it systematically.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.960]   We agreed on a lot of the protocols like formats,
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.840]   like metadata, like the quality level of scans,
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.960]   making sure that they're archive quality,
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.960]   making sure there is redundancy,
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.680]   making sure that this project is something
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.280]   that stays with us and is not something that a company,
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.560]   no matter what that company is,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.600]   decides it's not worth pursuing 10 years from now.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.640]   I mean, let's be frank, companies change
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.400]   because the needs and pressures on companies change.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.800]   And no matter what the company is,
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.240]   we don't know what it's going to be like in 10 years.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.520]   So this should be a public project, not a private project.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.080]   Because the benefits are public and because the costs are public.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.280]   Because right now what you have is essentially corporate welfare.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.440]   Essentially you have all these public universities donating
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.040]   all their riches to a private company,
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.440]   which is then going to set up a commercial project
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.320]   through the libraries, in fact, and with their benefit.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.440]   And I mean, with their goods and with almost no direct benefit.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.280]   And actually pretty high cost to the libraries,
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.120]   which they didn't expect.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.960]   We know after the publishers,
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.840]   why shouldn't the publishers take a responsibility here,
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.080]   rather than just complaining about someone who tried to fill a gap
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.280]   that was out there as they like newspaper publishers, magazine publishers,
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.320]   everyone else just believe they were in Brigadoon.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.840]   They're going to benefit from this.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.000]   They have the first rights.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.520]   They have the means, I would think, to digitize easier.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.840]   And they're going to benefit from it,
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.480]   shouldn't they be required to take a lead?
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.160]   No, well, look, publishers have been.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.680]   For more than 10 years, they've been digitizing their works.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.200]   They've been offering them in various forms.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.720]   They don't even need to digitize.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.600]   The works start digital these days.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   Well, exactly, right.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.000]   And they have been offering them in various forms,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.120]   but they've been offering them as part of library subscriptions.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.480]   They've been offering them to Amazon.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.280]   They've been offering them to Google for more than five years.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.480]   Publishers are on top of this and have been for more than 10 years.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:09.000]   There was no incentive to digitize the out-of-print material, certainly.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.800]   And certainly no incentive to digitize the works of the 20th century.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.280]   And isn't that what we really want?
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.680]   I mean, that's the truth is that's the goal.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.200]   In answer to Jeff's question, no publisher has an interest in doing that
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.240]   because the reward per copy is so low, right?
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.920]   Google has found an interest in doing it and great.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.280]   And I'm happy that if they want to pursue,
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.640]   you know, doing this for their own means, let's do it.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.760]   But let's not pretend it's for the public.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.560]   You know, that's, I mean, that just makes me sick.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.440]   When, when Sergio Brin writes in the Times that he's doing it to,
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.120]   to, you know, make sure that the next time Stanford Library in the flood,
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.120]   it's all about preserving the knowledge.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.600]   You think there's no, oh, come on.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.200]   There's, there can be some greater benefit.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.320]   You know, if, if, if Google did only the things that were profitable,
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.440]   Google's mission to organize the world's information and bring it to us,
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.080]   I think, yes, obviously that's how they make money
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.920]   and they'll be the first to say it.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.360]   But, but I also think there is a bit of a mission in it.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.280]   I don't think it was as cynical as you're trying to...
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.760]   If it weren't cynical, then it would have been more honest, right?
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.000]   I mean, the fact is nowhere in that op-ed did he,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.360]   did he cop to the fact that this is a revenue generating project?
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.400]   Nowhere, right?
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.880]   I mean, you'd think that that would be important.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.280]   I, I was actually surprised that New York Times gave away op-ed space
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.200]   for an advertisement for a major corporation.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.760]   I mean, it's just, it was a joke.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.680]   But look, that's, that's between me and Sergio.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.600]   He never calls, so, you know, he'll probably never.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.720]   But again, an answer, an answer to Jeff's question.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.280]   Look, so yes, publishers have a, have a, look,
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.520]   every company should be doing what's in every company's interest.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.640]   And the publishers have been doing what's in their interest for a long time.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.320]   The question is, from the publisher's point of view,
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.000]   you know, who's going to pay for getting all this stuff?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.280]   Much of which doesn't have an obvious
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.640]   rights holder anyway, right?
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.400]   So much of which doesn't have a publisher to be attached to.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.880]   And if we actually want a usable comprehensive archive,
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.640]   covering multiple languages, covering every possible subject,
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.920]   organize and, and searched intelligently,
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.240]   there is a community of people who are well trained to do this
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.800]   and already paid to do this and are called librarians.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.640]   And that's who should be taking the lead in terms of the nuts and bolts here.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.080]   That's who should be, because they're already committed
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.440]   to making such an archive happen, making such a service happen.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.120]   The one didn't say, I mean, that's, you know, because they were to say.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.480]   Oh, yeah, easy to, easy to answer because they're uncoordinated and underfunded.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.240]   They're an undercoordinated political force and they're underfunded
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.920]   at every level, right? So if we actually cared about this, we should fund them.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.680]   That's basically what I've been arguing.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.200]   I think that's reasonable. Is there any, do you think there's any political will to do that?
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.760]   Not yet. I'm hoping to generate it. And I'm actually hoping that,
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.280]   that if, you know, one of the things we can learn from this, if it fails enough,
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.120]   is, I mean, I go back and forth and whether I want the settlement to completely collapse,
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.920]   right? Because there's a lot of good in it too.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.600]   But one of the things that we might get out of this is the sense,
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:15.880]   a widespread sense that we almost had a very usable service and it wasn't,
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.880]   we weren't able to push it through, not we, but they weren't able to push it through
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.440]   because they're, you know, this was not the way to do it. And we might start asking,
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.800]   maybe there's a better way to do it. And I'm not saying that my way to do it
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.600]   is the best way to do it, you know. I have a particular vision of how to do this.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:38.120]   It's something I wish we had started 15, 20 years ago. I actually think step one is to bring all
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.640]   of the interested parties, public and private together, to work on a 50 year project. Because
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.800]   that's really what it's going to take to do this right, to do it high quality, do it globally,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:54.200]   etc. And, you know, I call it the human knowledge project. I want this to be done with the same sort
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:01.720]   of passion and commitment that the human genome project enjoyed at the end of the last century.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:10.440]   And that's a tremendous success. Done, of course, as a supplement or competition to a fast moving,
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.640]   high energy, brilliant private company called Solera, which was essentially trying to do the
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.960]   same thing on the cheap, on the cheap and fast. And one, I mean, one of the sense.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:28.600]   It ended up being essentially a tie. But both services are now very valuable to researchers.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.080]   Right.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.440]   One has not destroyed you.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:37.240]   So maybe Google and a private attempt with Google and a public effort as well?
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.200]   Sure. I mean, nothing wrong with that. Google still has to deal with its lawsuit with the
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:47.880]   publishers, which is going to be a whole other thing. I mean, the publishers are always going
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.520]   to want a piece of whatever Google rolls out. And until Google comes up with a system that
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:59.640]   guarantees the publishers some cut, then the publishers are going to keep pushing on the lawsuits.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.400]   Jeff, I get the feeling you think, and I don't want to put words in your mouth,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.680]   but this is like better than nothing. It was kind of a necessary evil, if not Google who?
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:14.120]   Well, you know, I see this happening again and again and again, where Google sees an opportunity
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.760]   in the market and seizes it. And that's what happens in an open market. And you have the
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.800]   incumbents whining about that, but Google didn't do anything in the other cases, I think. I think
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.520]   they overstepped the bounds on the book settlement. And I'm not sure it was done as a cynical act.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:33.160]   I would argue that it was done as almost a naive act, which sounds silly when it comes to Google,
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.840]   but they just said, "Oh, everybody's going to love us for doing this." And didn't see the opportunity.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.600]   It doesn't seem silly. In fact, a lot of what Google does looks naive. And it sounds
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:46.440]   seva. It sounds like you'd see a lot more intent in what they're up to. You don't buy the
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:53.400]   Ingenuous Act. No, I don't. And I never do. But I also know that-- I feel like they are naive,
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.440]   but obviously they couldn't see. There has to be a certain level of naivete
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:04.040]   in any company that takes risks like this, because that's the leap of faith, right? You have to have
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.480]   faith in what you do. You have to have faith in your company. And so you're going to be,
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.880]   look, Henry Ford thought he was making the world better too. Look at the damage he did.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:17.320]   Right? But no one could look in Henry Ford's eyes and believe that he didn't believe every word
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:23.720]   he said. So the bad and the good. He thought he was making the world better. So now that's not
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:30.120]   to equate Larry and Sergey with Henry Ford by any means. But let's remember that to do all of
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:37.240]   that work, to raise all that cash, to put those hours in, you've got to believe that you're doing
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:42.680]   it for more than the money. But that's an internal thing. What should matter to us is not what they
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.800]   believe. What should matter to us is what happens in the real world. And I just don't think we need to
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:55.160]   be snowed by the pretty words that seem to outline what they believe when, in fact, they're
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:00.760]   half-truths. But let me ask you a hypothetical. This wouldn't surprise me. There is no political
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.320]   will to do this. We're in a tough recession. The government's already getting a lot of heat for
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:12.040]   the spending they're doing. If public doesn't want to do it, would it be okay for Google to do it?
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.800]   Not under the current laws, but I'll tell you what, if Google wanted to actually change the
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.200]   current laws, maybe it could be. So, you know, look, copyright is in the way. And if Google
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.640]   wanted to change copyright, you should do it the hard way. You should do it the hard way, the old
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.280]   fashion way, the way of old-fashioned American political corruption, right? That's what Larry
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.000]   Leis expects. Don't break the law. Change the law. Well, that in a way, yes. But
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.960]   it's not just Google that would want to change the law. Every librarian would be on Google side
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.560]   changing law, too. And I would, too. You know, basically, copyright law gets in the way of
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:48.600]   thinking this big, whether it would be the Library of Congress doing it or Google doing it
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.080]   or Yahoo doing it, the law's still the law and the law's in the way and the law's dumb.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:24:00.840]   But to change it, you have to actually be political. So regardless of whether you want to adopt my
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:08.600]   vision of a 50-year plan to connect, you know, the most information to the most people in the world,
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:14.600]   the human knowledge project, or you want to do the quick and easy Google plan,
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.760]   either way, you have to change the law.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:23.960]   You know, I think maybe as an analogy of space exploration, which--
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.760]   A lot of--
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.720]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.520]   To be done, right?
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.880]   Siva, you paused. It wasn't a pause. It was a Skype pause. So I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.240]   A Skype-- Skype burp.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.040]   Yeah, right, right. So anyway, yeah.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:41.480]   We're going to move on. I think we could go on for hours on this. And I think it's a great subject.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.400]   I'm really glad that you're here to talk about Siva. And I think-- I have to say,
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:50.680]   I think I kind of support your advocacy of the public option. We can now call it the public option.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:50.680]   Right.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.080]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.600]   It's worked so well in the past.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.400]   The question is, look, do we want this? If we want it, let's do it. We don't want it.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:07.160]   Let's not do it. But it is a political thing. It is a policy thing. And let's not pretend that
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:12.280]   that we should get something for nothing and hope that Google rides in and gives us something for
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.520]   nothing. It's probably not a hugely expensive thing to do in the scope of things.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.560]   It really is.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.120]   And it really is.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.400]   Would you do you have any ideas?
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.400]   But only Google is willing to do it.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.120]   I think that's--
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.320]   Only Google is willing to do it.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.120]   Okay.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:24.680]   No, no.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.160]   Back to--
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.000]   That's not advertising.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.840]   Google came in with new structures for advertising that took on risk that provided pay for performance
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.360]   to advertisers. And the advertisers didn't leave to go to Google because Google's evil,
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.000]   because they got a better deal. It's a competitive marketplace.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.880]   So Google sees--
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.440]   That's a totally different--
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.160]   That's a great place.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:49.320]   And has the guts, as you would say, Siva, to go in.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.200]   And they have the--
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.040]   If you want to call it naivete or vision or courage, whatever it is,
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.200]   I think that I still believe that's something to be celebrated.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.200]   Did they overstep in this case because of copyright law?
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:00.920]   Yes, I agree with you.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.240]   They did.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.120]   But I still think this is a worthy project on one way or the other.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:08.040]   If Google puts the pressure on government to do it, then that's a good in the end.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.160]   And let's keep the pressure on.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.960]   Yeah, as long as you do it the right way.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.160]   I mean, no, but look,
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.480]   Google wasn't the only party interested in doing this.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.600]   You can look back in the library literature 30 years
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:25.400]   and see a very articulated vision of how to pursue this sort of project.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.520]   What they lacked in the libraries was the political support.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:34.600]   And that's because you and I were not rallying toward the support of libraries to do it.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.400]   Look, Google's boldness was wonderful,
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.440]   but one of the things that really shocked librarians was the fact that they had been
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.560]   hoping to reach that level of coordination that it would take
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.680]   and get the level of public support and it was never coming.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:54.360]   So Google took the place of the public, essentially what you have here is public failure.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.480]   Now, in some ways better Google than no one, I understand that argument completely.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.680]   I'm sympathetic to it.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.240]   You know, look, better Walmart deliver the water than no one deliver the water after Katrina,
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:05.640]   right?
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.480]   But it doesn't make FEMA's failure any lighter that Walmart had to do it, right?
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.840]   So that's essentially what we're in.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.800]   And what we need to do is ask ourselves, is this the real,
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:20.920]   the best way to build the information ecosystem that we actually want
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.000]   children to benefit from in 50 years?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.080]   Do we know that Google will be around in 50 years in 10 years?
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:33.080]   Do we know that in five years Google's board of directors will still think of Google Book Search
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:33.960]   as a good bet?
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:41.640]   I think we're in an age when we're not doing the best and the best was a bit of a myth in the past.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.400]   We're in the age of good enough.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.480]   And the internet makes it possible to do things just well enough that make it work.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.800]   And so that's why things like paywalls don't work because I can go to something else that's
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.920]   good enough for me.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.000]   And we don't like that.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.400]   And it may kind of offend our academic view of perfection.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:04.680]   But I think that it's the true way the world operates is that that cubes get filled and they
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.560]   get filled by good enough.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.360]   And what's a better tribute to that than Microsoft?
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.200]   It's not good enough if it's illegal, first of all, and it's not good enough.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.240]   No, it's not good.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:20.760]   Well, sometimes the illegal part is, I mean, this is for the greater good.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.560]   So maybe let's push those limits and maybe get those laws changed.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.200]   It is for the greater good, right?
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.960]   Except if the good.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:36.120]   I mean, that's if my vision of it is for the greater good rather than the greater Google.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.240]   Was it not that light in your book?
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.240]   It will be now.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:49.960]   Was it structured in such a way so that if Google did, say, oh, we don't want to do this anymore,
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:56.120]   that that data would not, would it not revert to the public and become a public available
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:56.600]   database?
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.120]   Not quite.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.640]   And it actually was a patchwork.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:05.160]   So one of the things that Google did with the libraries, the source of this material,
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:13.240]   was offer them digital copies of the materials they scan from their libraries.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:22.120]   And they would have ability to use that material within the institution itself,
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.320]   but not distribute it beyond the institution and not distribute it in a way that would
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.520]   compete with Google in any way.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.120]   So to a lot of universities, that seemed like a pretty good deal.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.400]   It was a way of getting their own material digitized.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.440]   What the universities didn't expect was, first of all, the low quality of the scans,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.560]   the number of missing pages, the number of human hands in the way, those sorts of things,
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.720]   which has become a real challenge.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.960]   That's actually a lesser problem.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.560]   The bigger problem was that in many cases, and I know at my university,
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:04.120]   the university itself is actually too scared to download the material to their own servers,
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.640]   because that would be contributing to potential copyright infringement.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:13.080]   Universities shielded by this settlement, even if settlement goes through, universities are
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.000]   still potentially liable for taking part in this.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.680]   And they are really upset about this and really scared about this,
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.040]   because they've been essentially left out of the deal.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.600]   And so that's one of the problems.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.640]   But it's ironic, because I think that's one reason Yale decided to go with Microsoft instead
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.240]   of Google for digitization.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.000]   But then Microsoft said, "We're done.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.040]   We don't want to do that anymore."
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:40.120]   But Microsoft was working with the Internet Archive, which is enough for profit institution,
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.600]   and they also weren't doing any copyrighted material.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.280]   So that's how they kept themselves clean.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:50.280]   And of course, that leaves a lesser collection, and it's a shame, but that actually points out
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.560]   the fact that the copyright law is stupid and should be changed for its own sake, not for Google.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:01.240]   Come on, Google for their bravery compared to Microsoft, at least to attempt to open this
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.440]   can of worms.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.200]   Yeah, but then they check out and settle, so they wouldn't even fight it in court.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.560]   I mean, that was the other thing.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.880]   In the beginning, all the libraries were thinking, "Well, this is great.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.920]   Google's going to go to the mat for..."
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:15.240]   People were upset that they didn't fight for the fair use of this.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.600]   Exactly.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.720]   I mean, I never expected them to go all the way, because I thought they were going to lose anyway,
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.000]   and I thought they knew they would lose.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Really?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.480]   Really?
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:26.760]   Because a lot of legal experts thought they had a good fair use case.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.040]   I know, you know, and the funny thing is, there are a bunch of people who are much smarter than me,
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.560]   and who teach better law schools.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:38.920]   The whole time I kept thinking, I was looking at the courts that were going to see this case,
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.360]   and the mood of those various courts.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.360]   And I just didn't see it stacked in Google's favor.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.320]   If this were a Ninth Circuit case, if this were Northern California case,
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.000]   I think Google had a really good chance of making a very creative argument,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.480]   because that's sort of the style of the Ninth Circuit.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.600]   But this was a New York case.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.040]   This was a Second Circuit case, and First Southern District of New York,
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:58.920]   and then Second Circuit.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.480]   Then ultimately, it would have gone to the Supreme Court,
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:07.480]   because you would have had over some very important foundational cases that actually
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.920]   let search engines be legal.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:14.280]   You would have had a discrepancy between the Ninth Circuit's vision of copyright
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.640]   and the Second Circuit's vision of copyright.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.240]   It would have had to go to the Supreme Court,
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.200]   and there is no reason to believe that the Supreme Court would have been
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.720]   anything close to cool on copyright.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.160]   They haven't been for a number of years.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.880]   Sun Yissel Tamayor came from the Second Circuit.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:34.440]   She has no history of being particularly creative or even reasonable on copyright.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:41.480]   So I think actually losing Senator Dale Connor was a big loss in terms of copyright,
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.920]   because she was a very much a pragmatist, and losing suitable was big too.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.960]   So I actually had no, I mean this is obvious long before I knew that
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.760]   Cora was going to change on this, but really I just looked at the odds,
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.320]   and I said, this is sort of obviously copying.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:59.000]   See, I hate to interrupt your thought there, but you're getting some break up on your
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.040]   skis.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:05.400]   And what usually fixes this is unplugging the headset and plugging it back in again.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.000]   Let me just make sure.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.880]   Yeah, it works.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.440]   Good.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:08.680]   Good.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.800]   Cool, cool, cool.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   You know, I've been ranting.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.680]   So actually Gina knows everything you know is almost just...
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.720]   I'm channeling Gina.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.720]   I thought she was thinking that.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.640]   All right, I want to move on because there's so many other topics.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.800]   This is a great topic and see if I'm so glad you're here,
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:29.560]   but there are other things to talk about, including a page rank,
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.280]   which this is a really interesting story.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.160]   But before we do that, I do want to talk about our friends at Citrix,
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.640]   the folks who do go to meeting.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.320]   I'm a go to meeting fanatic.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.920]   It is because I don't, you know, I've been doing a lot of traveling lately.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:49.560]   And to be honest with you, I'd much rather stay home than travel and go to meeting.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.600]   That's exactly what it does.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.840]   It allows you to have those business meetings that you would be flying across the country to do
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.880]   at great expense at home or at your office, wherever you are.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.640]   Go to meeting.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:07.320]   You could try it right now if you want to go to go to meeting.com/twig
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.160]   and you could try it free for 30 days.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.600]   Go to meeting is that incredible software from Citrix that
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.520]   lets you, you could have it set up before I'm done talking here,
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.480]   instantly set it up in your computer Mac or PC.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.920]   And then whenever you are talking to somebody on the line,
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.680]   you're saying, "I got to describe this to you."
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.520]   It'd be great for this kind of discussion.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.040]   You could say, "Well, let me show you these documents."
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.200]   Or we could collaborate in a document together.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.760]   You say, "Go to go to meeting.com, press the join and meeting button.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.560]   Here's the meeting ID and boom, they're seeing your desktop.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.200]   They're seeing your PowerPoint or your keynote presentation.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.120]   They're seeing the documents that you're talking about.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.960]   They're seeing the spreadsheets, the drawings.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:48.920]   It's just a fantastic way to collaborate, to train and of course to present.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:53.320]   Lot of sales, lot of sales happen through Go to Meeting.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.240]   If you haven't tried it, give it a try right now.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.400]   In fact, if you haven't tried it lately, give it a try right now.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.400]   It's faster and better and easier to use.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:05.960]   Go to meeting.com/twig is the website for 30 days free.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.760]   The folks at Citrix, we thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.760]   Remember that address?
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.640]   Use no other.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.760]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:21.800]   I remember when Google changed its page rank algorithm or something.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.480]   People got all upset and they...
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.480]   I guess it's when they started publishing page rank and people say, "Oh, no, my page rank is lower,
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.920]   my page rank is high."
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.720]   And I even then I thought this is kind of a silly metric.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.240]   Maybe Google thinks so too because they've apparently
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.720]   dropped page rank from their webmaster tools.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.400]   Gina, you haven't said a word in a while.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.360]   Would you explain what page rank is?
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.280]   Are you there?
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.840]   Uh oh.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.360]   I can't hear you.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.720]   Is it me?
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.520]   No wonder you haven't said a word in a while.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.640]   She's been muted.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.520]   We can see her.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.160]   She's waving.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:57.880]   Are you muted?
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.360]   Did you press the...
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:58.840]   Can you hear me?
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.640]   Yeah, no, I hear you.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.440]   Okay, now you hear me.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.320]   Sorry about that.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:01.560]   No.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.880]   No, we thought you'd been awfully quiet.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.920]   Now I understand why.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.200]   No, no, no, I was letting Siva talk through the book thing
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.280]   because clearly I drank the Kool-Aid about the book thing.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.160]   But...
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.800]   Yeah, I'm actually glad to get some dissent about it.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.520]   Yeah, me too.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.160]   I think it's great.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.360]   I was like, "I love that op-ed.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.800]   I was glad that that's..."
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.000]   I love arguing with Siva.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.440]   So much fun losing.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.840]   I need a little more cynicism, I think.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.440]   But page rank.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.240]   So page rank is a number between one and 10, I believe,
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.320]   that Google would, you know, over the years would assign
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:37.640]   decides to indicate how high they would show up in search results.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.080]   Did it correlate directly to whether you'll be number one on the page
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:41.720]   or on the first page?
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.560]   I mean, was there any direct correlation at all?
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.440]   No, not at all.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.960]   It was just a number between one and 10.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.120]   But if you search for a keyword,
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.640]   the higher your page rank in theory,
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.080]   the higher you would show up on the page.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.000]   But there could be hundreds of other sites
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   who have the same exact page rank as your site.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.800]   I mean, it was just...
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.040]   And the algorithm behind it was totally opaque.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.680]   I mean, you had no idea why your page rank went up or down.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.480]   Things would change.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.040]   It would change.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.640]   People would freak out and get obsessed about it.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.240]   And frankly, I'm really glad that Google's saying,
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.080]   you know what, just don't pay attention to this dumb number
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.760]   between one and 10 anymore.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.760]   I'm with you on that.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.720]   You know, people were really furious that I'm only a four
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.400]   and they compare themselves to other pages.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.360]   He's only a six.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.480]   It's the human nature that you get all tied into this one number,
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.840]   because it's an easy number.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.720]   It's easy to see.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.360]   And I think that...
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.000]   I guess it was when they put that...
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.960]   There was a bookmarklet that you could see the Google page rank,
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.560]   or maybe it was in the toolbar.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.520]   It was in the toolbar.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.400]   There are a couple of websites where you can stick a putty URL in it.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.360]   It would tell you, yeah.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:42.600]   So did they say why they've dropped page rank from their webmaster tools?
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.520]   They didn't really say why.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.320]   They said for a long time, we've been saying that site owners
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.240]   shouldn't be too worried about this.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.520]   And it used to be showed in the Google toolbar,
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.320]   but this is our respectful hint for you to worry less about it.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.160]   Don't worry.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.120]   Be happy.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.840]   The fact that we haven't updated in a while,
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.360]   well, this is just our respectful way of saying,
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.880]   like, don't worry about this too much.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.080]   Page rank is just one over 200 signals
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.560]   that can affect how your site is crawled indexed and ranked.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.880]   So, you know, I think this is a really good thing,
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.360]   because I feel like Page rank is one of those tools
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.880]   that Black Hat SAOs use to just scare you into thinking
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.880]   you need their services and come up with all these crazy theories
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.120]   about how it works and sell you stuff that you don't need.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.680]   In fact, this is a really good part of a larger conversation
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.840]   about SEO that was going on this week.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.040]   I love that post.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.480]   I don't remember who it was.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.240]   Derek Powersek.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.920]   Yeah, Derek is so great.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.520]   He said, here's what you need to know.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:43.080]   You know, it's three things any idiot can do,
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.040]   everybody knows.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.240]   You put your keywords in the title of the page.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.440]   It's basic stuff, everybody knows.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:52.760]   Right.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.360]   He was saying that good web design begets a site
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.600]   that is understandable by the Google box.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.120]   Have a site map, you know, put content on your page.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.560]   Don't hide it in flash.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.600]   Simple things.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.320]   Everybody knows.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:09.240]   Anything beyond that is BS bogus Buncombe snake oil.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.360]   And, you know, Derek just quit smoking this week.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.080]   So, he's a little...
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.120]   Always cranky.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.240]   He's crankier than usual.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.080]   So, he really didn't pull any punches.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:17.560]   I loved it.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.560]   I thought that was so right on.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.080]   I've been kind of saying that for a long time,
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.680]   because I get people on the radio show,
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.440]   you know, SEOs call the radio show.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.840]   It's like somebody called today saying,
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.000]   you know, good web design, I could get you to number one.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.360]   And I said, no, you can't stop it.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:30.840]   Go away.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:36.120]   And the risk of getting banned by Google for gaming Google
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.040]   is so much worse than anything you can do to help me.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.960]   Anyway.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.600]   You know, the new thing that Google announced
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.240]   also this week that you can put in your site
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.480]   and see how the bot sees your site.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.560]   Is that part of understanding how well you constructed your site?
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:54.840]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.520]   So, in Webmaster Tools,
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.080]   oh, it looks like my video is not so good.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.120]   You didn't need the makeup today.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.400]   You're all blocky.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.680]   I'll try to turn that off.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.840]   It's like an Edvard Munch painting.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.640]   There we go.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.880]   So, in Webmaster Tools, which is for site publishers,
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.880]   there's a new labs feature that lets you see
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.880]   how the Google bot sees your site.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.040]   So, you pop into URL and then you can see.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.800]   And you know, this was something that I always did
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.160]   whenever anybody asked me about how, you know, badly or well,
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.600]   their site would get crawled.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.640]   I used what's called the Web Developer Toolbar,
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.120]   where you could turn off images, turn off JavaScript,
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.560]   turn off CSS, and just get the straight up text.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.920]   You know, what is the Google bot see,
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   which is basically the text of the site.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.160]   So, that's basically what that Webmaster does.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.960]   Do you don't have to worry about somewhere?
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.440]   I read also that like the first 1,400 characters
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.720]   are what matter on the page,
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.560]   but you don't have to worry about JavaScript and stuff.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.840]   It ignores that, right?
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.440]   Yeah, I believe so.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.200]   I mean, I think the Google bot gets smarter
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.160]   and better all the time.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.080]   So, I think, and actually Matt Cutts mentioned last week,
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.760]   that they're figuring out ways for it to crawl Ajax content,
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.440]   which is interesting.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.160]   But I think for the most part, yeah, I mean, you know,
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.240]   the title, the head, the title, the body, you know,
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.280]   your headlines, you should be using H tags
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.520]   for your headlines and P tags for your paragraphs.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.920]   I mean, there's no trickery to it.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.240]   It's just good markup, ordered well on the page
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.560]   with the most important stuff first.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.000]   You know, it's just like, you know, good journalism,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.240]   you know, get to the point in the first couple of sentences,
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.320]   write your headlines well with keywords
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.240]   that people would search for.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   I mean, not, you know, the fact is
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.760]   you shouldn't write your site for search engines, right?
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.880]   You should write it for readers.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.560]   And if you follow that, you'll be fine.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.520]   You know, Leo, I think the page rank to me
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.600]   has an emotional tie to the earliest days.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.080]   It was really, to me, the first insight.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.520]   And I don't know if it's lore or not,
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.960]   the page rank is not named after pages, but after Larry.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.360]   Oh, Larry Page rank.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.400]   Oh, right.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.520]   I don't know if that's true or not, but I think
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:59.040]   that the notion, the ding insight that Google had,
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.120]   that the two guys had, was to trust us
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.720]   and listen to our clicks and links and to use that.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.360]   And so I think that that's an important kind of underpinning
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.120]   of how our new world works.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.760]   But the other problem is we always get carried away
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.240]   with numbers and lists.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.120]   Doc Serals said long ago that though he loves Tech Erati,
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.560]   he was on the board of advisors, Tech Erati,
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.120]   he thinks the Tech Erati top 100 list is one of the worst things
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.400]   to ever happen to the blogosphere,
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.800]   because we obsess about it.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.160]   We have Dave Weiner and Jay Rosen complaining
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.080]   about the suggested user's list.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.080]   Follow our numbers.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.440]   Right.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.080]   And I think we do tend to get obsessed by these lists
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:37.440]   and numbers and it tends to pervert the web,
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.320]   which ignores that end of the tale.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.520]   And Matt Cuts calls it the big butt that's attached
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.560]   to the long tail where the most gax is actually happens.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:49.800]   I love that.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.880]   That's good.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.440]   You know, in response to Derek's post, Danny Sullivan,
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.840]   who I actually highly respect and writes about search engine,
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.880]   does incredible search engine--
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.720]   And I'm trying to get him on the show by the way.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.680]   Yeah, I was going to say, I would love to have him on the show.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.880]   You know, he wasn't happy with Derek's post.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.240]   He said, you know, there are people out there who
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.400]   are publishing sites and they are web developers.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.480]   And they don't know these things.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.960]   You know, something like this comes very naturally
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.120]   to someone like Derek, who's an incredible designer,
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.560]   who creates WordPress themes and publishes them.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   Like, it seats obvious, quote unquote, advice to him,
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.520]   but not to everyone else.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.760]   And that all SEO isn't bad.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.720]   So something to keep in mind.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.040]   In fact, I can add that to the show now.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.280]   It's both those posts.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.120]   I would say, however, that you don't need to hire somebody.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.120]   If SEO is four things that you can easily write
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.200]   on the back of an envelope--
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:40.080]   Well, though, Leo, I used to consult for about.com.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.960]   And they have an SEO genius there.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.560]   And it really does amount to more than that.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.440]   It's also how you think about the structure of your world.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:52.680]   So he got the New York Times to rethink the headlines
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.920]   and the way they write headlines.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.000]   And the fact that they have to be clear.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.920]   And though some lament that it's headlines written for machines,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.280]   the truth is they were also just much clearer
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.120]   and forget about SEO.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.920]   RSS is the death of the cute headline and the anecdotal lead.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.480]   It's a different structure of our world.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.920]   The fact that the New York Times started topic pages, which
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.080]   is now a cynical act of most websites.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.400]   But it was important at the time.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.720]   The next thing that strikes me, I got somebody who was yelling
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.280]   at me on Twitter that I can't go a show without either--
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.440]   I don't know.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.440]   Holding up that book.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.040]   40-month book or mentioning hyper-personal news
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.280]   streams.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.520]   So there I did it again twice.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.040]   But if you go past the whole--
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.880]   I think part of the point about going past page rank
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.440]   is the web is going past the page.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.800]   Not the Larry, the page.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.000]   That's a very good point.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.440]   It's stream, and we have to break out of that idea
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:50.560]   that everything is centered and focused and centralized.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.280]   And now in a new hyper-distribution mechanism,
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.800]   you insinuate yourself into all kinds of streams.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.520]   And that changes the structure.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:01.920]   So Gina, I think you're right in that at the simple level
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.200]   of SEO sites are--
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.560]   some sites just don't know how to do it.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.080]   There's a sophisticated level of it
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.160]   that gets to about.com.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.360]   And the reason that it gets half its revenue and 80%
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.720]   of its page views from Google.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.840]   But there's also a need to, I think, rethink
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.280]   the structure of how we and old media think about content.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.760]   And we've kept it too much focused on the notion
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.800]   of the publication.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.840]   That's why people get so excited about every damn new ebook
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:27.480]   reader coming.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.720]   And it's going to save the magazine in a newspaper,
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.360]   because they think it's going to save its packaged structure
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:32.760]   of it.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:36.040]   But it's not, because content is atomized now.
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.440]   And that's what's really happened here.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.200]   Do you think we replace page rank with some sort of reputation
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.360]   number with a person rank?
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.200]   Well, that's what we've been hoping for.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   But again, I think the problem with all those things
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.880]   is its one size fits all.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.560]   Right?
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.040]   Siva and I can--
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.560]   our friendly jousting about Google,
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.360]   most people are going to trust him more than me,
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   because he is more doubting than I am.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.760]   But a few might come along and say, no, I like Google,
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.880]   so I trust Jarvis more on this topic.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.880]   And the beauty of the web is you can get both of us in a link.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.760]   And so the notion that there's a one size fits all who's
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.560]   best at this topic or more trustworthy or anything like that,
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.400]   the web makes a lie of all those simplistic things.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.040]   Right.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.080]   Yeah, reputation is in the eye of the beholder.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:21.960]   Exactly.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:25.720]   So you can't have an arbitrary objective reputation.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:31.600]   Gina might hold me in low regard, and you might hold me in lower
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.800]   regard, and that would be--
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.880]   Always, I'm going to say, Google would have nothing to do with that.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.440]   Although it's a really wonderful--
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.120]   although thorny-- but it really would be a useful nut to crack
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:50.920]   if we could somehow figure out a way to convey that information.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.920]   I mean, Google just made some recommendations
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.400]   speaking a personal page rank, or what comes up for you
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.720]   when you start to your name in Google.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.640]   They made some recommendations this week about how to deal
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.960]   with that when people start to your name.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.040]   I saw that, yeah.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:02.540]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:03.800]   It was interesting.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.200]   I mean, it was pretty obvious advice, I think,
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.360]   for people who think about this stuff a lot like that.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.680]   It's why it didn't bookmark it, because we know it.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.480]   Yeah, we know that stuff.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.880]   But I'm glad you brought it up.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.000]   Yeah, but the one paragraph I thought was kind of interesting,
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.600]   is that they said, if someone searches for your restaurant
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.480]   or your business or yourself, and they come up with results,
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.560]   or you get results that you're not so happy with,
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.880]   and you can't get the site owners to remove that stuff,
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.000]   and you don't own the site, so you can't remove it,
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.640]   just make sure that you get positive things published
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.640]   about your business or your restaurant or yourself,
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.200]   so that viewers on Google can get a rounded view,
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.400]   both the positive and the negative,
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.600]   and that felt a little bit like they were kind of encouraging,
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.320]   not spam, but they were saying, hey,
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.000]   get both points of view out there.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.120]   If the negative ones out there come out
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.800]   and put a positive one out there.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.920]   Yeah, Gina, I think it's a call to creation,
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.720]   and it's a call to everyone to have an identity
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.680]   and a place on the web.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.280]   If you don't have that, you're lost in this new world,
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.960]   and so you need to have that.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.440]   And we immediately are learning that,
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.840]   that the individual writers have more of a brand
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.880]   now than the publication.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.840]   I see that a lot of employees in Business Week
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.920]   just sold a Bloomberg have basically said,
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.760]   I'm not staying off social media.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.680]   I'm a Steven Baker, a great post about this.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.520]   He's a writer there.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.360]   I'm not staying off social media,
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.560]   because social media is how we're going to have a connection
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.080]   of the world that's in order without a publication.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:20.280]   That's our future.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.720]   It's our personal brand.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.360]   It's not a corporate brand.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:28.000]   One of the regrets I had when I spoke in Dubai last week
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.560]   at the TEDx there is that I shouldn't have been more forthright.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.640]   What I meant to say when I was trying to say is,
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.480]   speaking to the Arab world,
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.040]   you have a chance with new media
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.920]   to revamp your reputation in the US.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.520]   The Arab world has been very poorly painted in the US
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.680]   after 9/11 for a variety of reasons.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:51.280]   And I'm talking to these wonderful people
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.440]   from all over the Arab world,
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:57.280]   you know, Kuwait and Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.240]   And I said, this new media, here's your chance
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.320]   to create podcasts and blogs and videos
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:07.320]   and start a conversation and do an end around
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.440]   this poor representation.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.480]   You now can own your representation in the US.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.120]   And that's what we need to do if we're going to have world peace.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.920]   So it's really an important issue.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.560]   Not merely how do you keep your corner shop
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.760]   from being, you know, delegated on Yelp.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.560]   It's really an issue that we need.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.000]   And I think there's good news,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.600]   which is that everybody can do it.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.640]   Now, this is a good post.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.960]   It's funny because I looked at it, Gina,
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.080]   and I thought I should talk about it,
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.240]   but then now everybody who listens knows that, you know.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.080]   The other funny thing about that post is they were,
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.680]   they used as an opportunity to remind the world
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:44.080]   this Pache Siva that Google doesn't own the world.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.600]   Google doesn't own everything.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.280]   You can't come after us to change it.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.360]   You got to go to the post.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.760]   That was the good line.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.600]   That was the good line in there.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.040]   But they also plug Google profiles.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.400]   Which we have been plugging and we believe in
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.760]   and I wish people would use it.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.840]   And I wish Google, you know, Google could do something
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.840]   by making those profiles more visible on a page.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.080]   You still, if you Google my name,
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.560]   you do not see my Google profile even at the bottom of the page.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.400]   - Oh, really?
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.240]   - Yeah.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.080]   - You've got the bottom.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:10.920]   - No.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.480]   And I asked Kevin Marks when he was still at Google about that.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.160]   And he said, "Well, with some celebrities,
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.280]   they don't do that because they don't want people fighting.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.200]   I don't know what it is.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.800]   Like if you're sharing stone, not the Hollywood share.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.640]   I don't know what it is.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.960]   But for some reason, it doesn't.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.000]   I think your Google profile, if Google really means
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.640]   what they say about your responsible for your reputation,
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.440]   your Google profile should be the first search result, right?
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.640]   That's your canonical result.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.720]   - That was the idea behind it.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.760]   - Yeah, but that's not what they're doing.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.960]   For most people, it shows up at the bottom.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.520]   - Yeah, it shows up at the bottom for normals.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.160]   - Yeah, for normals.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.960]   Anybody but Leo apparently.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.360]   (laughing)
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.200]   Normals.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.760]   - I don't want to step on your numbers, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.200]   So I don't know what your number of the week is,
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.720]   but there was a number this week that I thought was stunning.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.560]   Is this your number 10?
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.040]   - No.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:05.880]   - 10%.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.040]   - I'm sick eat of a number, Leo.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.880]   (laughing)
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.280]   - You just farted out.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.040]   The amazing Kreskin.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.560]   - I'm thinking of an, I'll tell you the number 10.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:18.640]   According to Arbor Networks, 10% of all net traffic
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.040]   is Google traffic.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.000]   - Oh, it's 10, I thought it was six.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.240]   - Well, this is Arbor Networks.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.560]   - It's close to 10, let's put it that way.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.480]   - Oh, okay, okay.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.960]   - That's related to another story that's up on the front feed,
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.720]   which is that we all thought--
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.920]   - Another number is zero.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.160]   - Yeah, I was thinking back up from YouTube bandwidth
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.520]   and that Google pays zero for bandwidth basically
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.080]   because they bought all kinds of dark fiber back in the day.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:44.920]   - Brilliant.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.960]   - And they're not paying for the bandwidth.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.720]   They have all kinds of agreements in position
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.360]   and that's why they can afford YouTube.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.880]   - Bandwidth is free, let's face it,
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.000]   bandwidth is free for these big guys
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.560]   because of peering relationships of nothing else.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.400]   - Exactly.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.560]   - Is that, is that right?
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.000]   - Wait, so how does this work?
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.320]   - It doesn't sound right.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.320]   - It doesn't sound right.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.720]   - It's the new math.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.560]   (laughing)
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.680]   - Yeah, I'm confused about how that works.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:09.960]   - All right, I'll see if I can explain this.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.040]   I've had it explained to me, J. Adelson,
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:16.240]   who was now at Vision3, was used to rent Equinox,
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:21.240]   which was a big internet, I don't know, backbone company.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.560]   And he hears how he explained it.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.480]   He said, "If you're America,
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.160]   let's give you, as an example, American Online."
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.160]   And you are, is this a good example?
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.920]   Maybe Google's a better example.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:36.000]   Let's say you're Google and you're putting,
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:36.920]   no, American Online's better.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.760]   American Online and you're consuming a lot of content.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.680]   You're big ISP, you're consuming a lot of content.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.040]   It's a very one way street.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.920]   What you can do is you open up these peering relationships
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.440]   with, let's say YouTube and you say,
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:51.400]   "Look, we're gonna consume a lot of YouTube content."
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.800]   So we, by the way, one of the reasons I know this
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.560]   is we get free bandwidth from AOL.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.480]   We help in their peering relationship.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.440]   They need to make an equal amount of bandwidth
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.800]   going in both directions.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.760]   So if they consume a lot of bandwidth,
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.680]   they need to send out a lot of bandwidth.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.200]   So they set up peering relationships,
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.960]   which are basically direct connections,
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.120]   and they need to balance those relationships
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:13.000]   by sending an equal amount of bandwidth in both directions.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.600]   And so, you know, Google might set up a deal
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.760]   because Google is, let's see how we can put it this way,
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:25.320]   Google's sending a lot so they would need to receive a lot.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.440]   So they-- - We need a whiteboard.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.800]   - It's too complicated, I'm sorry.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.800]   - No, no, no, no, you're crying,
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.800]   you're crying, you're doing well.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.280]   (laughing)
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.960]   - The idea of peering relationships is
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.280]   we wanna have a direct connection.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.320]   YouTube is directly connected to Comcast as an example.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.480]   And Comcast is gonna suck down a lot of YouTube bandwidth.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.920]   So Comcast peers, we're gonna use a lot of bandwidth,
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.480]   but we'll make a deal so that it costs neither party,
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:53.200]   anything, by sending you a lot of content in our direction.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.120]   And then we'll just kind of write it off
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.760]   as a zero-cost transaction.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.480]   - So they're bartering bandwidth.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.080]   So it doesn't cost-- - Essentially.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.080]   - Yeah. - So let me get this straight.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.720]   So Comcast customers are using all kinds of bandwidth.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.560]   - Right.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:10.000]   - YouTube viewers are using a lot of bandwidth,
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.240]   or YouTube itself is using a lot of bandwidth.
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.800]   - So then it meets in the middle.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.720]   It meets in the middle.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.920]   So essentially, it's like, okay, Jeff, you and I are talking a lot,
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:22.040]   let's get a tie line, the direct line between each other.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.520]   And then our costs will go down because we have a direct pipe,
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.240]   we're not using anybody else's connection.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.880]   And to make sure that that financial transaction is fair,
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.400]   we'll just make sure we use it equally.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.880]   I send as much as I receive.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.040]   - And that's really amazing.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.320]   That actually blows my mind,
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:39.280]   'cause that's not at all how I thought
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.480]   bandwidth was working for these big companies.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.720]   - No, in fact, most of them are,
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.720]   I think, are paying nothing for bandwidth.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.920]   Now, this dark fiber is another whole nother issue
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.400]   because there is a huge amount of dark fiber.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:53.520]   Google was very, that was smart of them to buy it up
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.920]   when it was cheap right after the internet bust,
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.480]   I would imagine.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.040]   You know, they often talk about these boom bust cycles.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.920]   I've read economic studies that say,
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:05.160]   these big booms have a real long-term value
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:09.400]   because in the case of the internet boom in 1999,
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.520]   all of this money that came out of these IPOs
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.600]   was invested in an infrastructure.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.200]   So a lot of infrastructure was built.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.800]   Same thing happened with the railroad booms.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.800]   Right after the Transcontinental railroad was built,
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.960]   most of the railroads went bankrupt.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.920]   But we got a railroad out of it.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.000]   And so right after the internet bust,
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.560]   we lost all these internet companies,
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.920]   but we got all this dark fiber, all this connectivity,
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:34.720]   all this infrastructure, which we're now benefiting from.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:38.880]   So that money that you lost when your pets.com stock
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.780]   went to zero, good news.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:43.980]   It makes internet access cheaper.
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:48.020]   Well, that's my other, one of my numbers of the week is 512.
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.460]   That's where I bought Google stock
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:52.500]   and now it's finally back over it to 553.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.500]   Yes!
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.460]   Wow, Google's back, baby.
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:57.820]   Really 512, it's that high?
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:58.860]   No, it's 553.
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:01.820]   Five times where I bought it right before boom,
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:02.660]   the clutch.
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:03.500]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:06.300]   And I was very transparent about that on my blog.
[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:07.140]   It's clear.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.020]   I had Google stock once,
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.940]   but I no longer have any tech stock.
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:12.780]   I might have some Google still.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.220]   Is it really that high?
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.180]   It's in my, if it is, it's in my, you know,
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.580]   it's in a fund somewhere that I unmanaged fund.
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:21.900]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:23.020]   Let's see here.
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.380]   So, but, well, I don't want to take your numbers away.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.940]   Is 25 million a number?
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:28.740]   Oh, no.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.260]   Eric Schmidt gives--
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:31.100]   Well, that's a good one, yeah.
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:35.180]   It's Princeton, $25 million for a tech fund.
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.020]   That's a good number.
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:37.420]   I don't know what the number's in the news today.
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:38.860]   Here's what I'll give you my number now.
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:39.700]   Here it is.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:40.540]   Oh, I don't want to spoil it.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.020]   I'll let it--
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:42.860]   Go ahead.
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:43.700]   All right, me, Steve.
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:44.540]   No, that was me.
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:46.220]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:49.860]   10,664, which is the number of language pairs
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.940]   Google Translator can now handle
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:56.060]   after adding 285 languages to its service,
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.540]   bringing the total to 345.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.140]   And of course, as Steve would tell us,
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.060]   they're ready to take over the world.
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:03.500]   So they're now worried about the 7,000 languages
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:04.580]   ready to die.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:06.660]   And I'm sure we'll be doing more things with those.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.380]   I mean, Google Books for Languages.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:09.900]   Cool.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:10.540]   To save them.
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:12.420]   They'll take over speech.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.020]   But some of those languages are like Swedish chef
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:17.660]   and pirate and stuff like that, right?
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:18.380]   Hang on.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:19.140]   Hang on.
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.780]   The question is what fraction is Swedish chef and pirate
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:22.620]   right there?
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:25.260]   So many languages are definitely the growing and thriving
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:25.460]   language.
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.020]   I think so.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:27.860]   No, it's the--
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:28.380]   I don't know.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:31.900]   I think the Swedish chef gets like 3 million hits on Google
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:32.860]   a month or something.
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:33.620]   I should look that up.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.980]   I feel like you were the myers at that at some conference
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:36.340]   this week.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:36.840]   Really?
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.980]   Why are anthropologists working about languages dying
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.700]   when you have so many silly languages sprouting up
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.540]   at rapid rate from all corners?
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.340]   Do you ever--
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.180]   Can we go back to the 25 million to Princeton?
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:48.820]   Not that I have an issue with that, although it would have
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:52.260]   been sweet if he had given it to the University of Virginia.
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:52.780]   But--
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:54.100]   Or the series of University of New York.
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.820]   You keep making noise, Steve, but he might.
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:56.500]   You never know.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:58.220]   Well, OK, but let's actually look.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:00.940]   But I actually wanted to make a serious point about CUNY,
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:01.140]   right?
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:06.780]   Because why do billionaires give money, millions of dollars,
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:08.700]   to universities that don't need it?
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:13.420]   Like, why not give that money to CUNY in the Jeff Jarvis
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:17.460]   endowed chair in technology and culture?
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.460]   Your lips, Siva, and your skiers.
[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:21.820]   But he's telling me that.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:26.220]   But Jeff has an potential to change lives of people who
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:32.500]   have not had an opportunity yet to demonstrate
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.940]   their facility in the world and their ability
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:38.380]   to fill in bubble forms with number two pencils.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:41.660]   Those are the people the billionaires should be funding.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:44.460]   Like, Princeton got funded three centuries ago.
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.500]   Why are you giving money to Princeton?
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.100]   I mean, I'm sure it's going to be used to be--
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.020]   There's a reason.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.580]   He graduated from Princeton.
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:51.900]   That's why.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.940]   Yeah, but you know, come on.
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:55.020]   Look, Bill Gates didn't graduate from anywhere.
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:56.420]   And he gave a tremendous amount of money
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.060]   that the school he dropped out of.
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:58.580]   You know?
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.360]   He gave a lot of money, part of the game,
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.180]   where my son wants to go now, or if anybody's watching.
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:03.620]   C.M. U.
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:04.140]   Right.
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.820]   But Siva, go back to the book one, though.
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:06.320]   Jake Jarvis.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:06.820]   C.M.
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:07.820]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:10.420]   Yeah, we're-- early decision time November 1,
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.580]   he has to apply to CME units.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:12.900]   Where he's applying to anyone who
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.740]   admissions is listening.
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:14.820]   Now I'm not going to influence you.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:16.140]   As long as we're plugging, Abby's
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:18.260]   going to be playing early admission to Brown University.
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:20.220]   And she's got her own podcast.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:21.180]   OK, I just want to mention that.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.700]   OK.
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:24.420]   Jake made Facebook apps and sold them.
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.420]   And I showed his book for more.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.980]   Both of them should get in.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.260]   Seriously, folks.
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.700]   Siva, but this goes back to the problem,
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.500]   I think, of government taking over the book scanning.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.900]   Because part of the problem, I think, with the rich folks
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.980]   is that they say, oh, it's taken care of.
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.620]   It's a government project.
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:42.780]   CUNY is a government project.
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:43.820]   It's government funded.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.500]   We will do great things with the money, as would you.
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:47.420]   And I absolutely agree.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.060]   But I think that's part of the problem with government
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:50.860]   funding, as it makes it seem as if, oh, it's checked off.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:51.660]   It's OK.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:52.220]   Huh.
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:52.660]   You're right.
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:52.820]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:53.820]   I think just opposite.
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:58.820]   I think people say, oh, OK, that may actually be the issue.
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.260]   I don't think it has anything to do with the idea of scanning
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.700]   books or funding libraries.
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.580]   People don't think libraries are well-funded or sufficiently
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:05.900]   funded.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.340]   No one can really imagine that CUNY is well-funded.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:10.940]   Nobody says CUNY is well-funded.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.860]   So it really is a matter of, again,
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:17.940]   whether we want to benefit from institutions like CUNY, which,
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.340]   I mean, that money could help people at the community college
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:26.140]   level actually learn how to program and push themselves
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.660]   into another level of wealth.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:31.100]   That, I mean, it could just do amazing amounts of--
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.300]   We have at CUNY.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:32.900]   Thank you, applause.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:38.780]   We have 250,000 students at CUNY, which is incredible.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.380]   How it educates New York.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.180]   And I am a graduate of CUNY, by the way.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.020]   You are?
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.020]   I didn't know that.
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:44.540]   That's great.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.660]   If only we had a fight song.
[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.580]   I'd sing it now, Gina.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.860]   That's why you don't get money.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.620]   You ain't got no fight song.
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:51.620]   Do they have a football team?
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.620]   Which college?
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.340]   Right.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.380]   You might notice my shirt from the University of Texas,
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.980]   I all my matter, which certainly has a share of billionaires
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.100]   given money to it.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.260]   But it is all about the football team and all about the memories
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:03.900]   and all that, and those aren't really good reasons.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.660]   Are you an Aggie?
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:06.140]   No, no.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.580]   Took 'em horns.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.060]   All right, right.
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.060]   The Aggies are the other team.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.220]   Hook 'em horns.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.060]   Sorry.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.900]   No, but that's something like why--
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.700]   There should actually be pressure on billionaires
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.420]   to get more bang for the buck out of their money
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:22.780]   and putting money closer to more students,
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.140]   making the student environment better
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:28.380]   at LaGuardia Community College, at Bure Manhattan
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.900]   Community College, at Brooklyn College,
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.500]   would do an amazing job.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:37.060]   To give it to community colleges in Silicon Valley, right?
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.500]   In San Jose would be a better move than give it to Prandtl.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.620]   You're a socialist, Siva.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.340]   No, not really.
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.020]   I'm just someone who--
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.020]   Socialist.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.140]   If I make a billion dollars through the great American system,
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.940]   I can give it to any Gosh darn university I want to.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.460]   Of course you can, but if you watch the new sitcom
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:57.940]   community, that might not work well for your clock.
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:02.140]   So that is a very funny show, I have to say.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.100]   It might-- anyway, so yeah.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.900]   The money goes to the Eric and Wendy Schmitt
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.060]   Transformative Technology Fund.
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.140]   And it'll be awarded through an annual campus Y--
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.740]   I think, actually, this is very cool.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:17.220]   Campus-wide peer-reviewed competition
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.420]   to support the invention or implementation
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.900]   of entirely new technologies that
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:24.780]   will have a major impact on a field of research.
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.220]   And it or it could be used for the acquisition of new equipment
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.580]   that will change the direction of research in a field.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.300]   You can fund my course on entrepreneurial journalism,
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.540]   where we have seed money to do the same thing,
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:39.100]   to save journalism, which Google killed.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.380]   I'll try that pitch.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.620]   Oh, you want reparations now, is that it?
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.220]   That's what it is.
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.220]   So that'll try that.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.380]   You think that'll work, right, Jeff?
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.540]   You might get an apology, but I doubt you'll get reparations.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:52.380]   I'm learning how to beg.
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:54.420]   All right, now since both Jeff and I
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.540]   do have college tuitions coming up--
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.100]   Oh.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.180]   I might--
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.420]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:06.540]   I might shift the conversation to a little company.
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:08.580]   You and I know as-- wait a minute,
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.340]   I have to get the book.
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.820]   Squarespace.com.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.500]   We're going to do-- I was talking to the Squarespace people
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.540]   at Blog World yesterday.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.180]   Of course, they were there because Squarespace
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:21.020]   is now the most popular--
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.380]   I'm making this up--
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.660]   but it's probably true-- the most popular blog platform,
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.100]   but not just a blog platform.
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:30.860]   Squarespace is all about websites.
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:33.180]   If you are a blogger, if you're on WordPress or Blogger
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.300]   or Moveable Type or Typehead, the beauty of Squarespace
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.820]   is that import feature that imports and exports.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:41.060]   They're wide open so you can get your data in,
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.020]   but you can get data out any time.
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.420]   They've got the forums.
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.380]   They've got a photo gallery, a form builder.
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.380]   They've got Google Maps.
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.460]   Great website tracking.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:52.020]   Built-in search engine optimization.
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.740]   OK, so you don't have to worry about that.
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:54.660]   Things like site maps.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.020]   Automatic.
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:58.140]   We're going to start using it for the radio show.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.540]   This is what I was talking with Squarespace about yesterday.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.340]   I want to do a redesign for the radio show.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:07.180]   And I'm really excited about not only the great design
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.540]   features of Squarespace, but just
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:12.420]   the ease of use, the power, and the cloud architecture
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:16.340]   that they use, which means that you never run out of bandwidth.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:22.020]   Squarespace sites are not an usual shared hosting situation.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:25.300]   It's kind of spread across the whole architecture,
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:29.100]   not just in a single location, but in all of their network
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:29.740]   operations centers.
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.140]   It's really kind of amazing.
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:33.940]   I want you to find out more about Squarespace by trying it free.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:36.060]   This is the simplest trial you've ever seen.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:40.100]   Just go to squarespace.com/twig.
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:42.260]   squarespace.com/twig.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.420]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.300]   All you need to do is enter your login and your password,
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:51.580]   and you'll be able to try it for two weeks absolutely free.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.500]   It couldn't be easier to use.
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.540]   squarespace.com/twig.
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:57.780]   Oh, look.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.740]   Look, it says, welcome Twig fans right there.
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:01.180]   That's so cool.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:04.820]   And if you decide to stick around, you
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:07.220]   can get 10% off the account when you use a coupon code Twig.
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.380]   So I hope they explain that.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:13.300]   And oh, I saw the new-- it's not Apple's kind of Apple's Apple.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.260]   They've got a new iPhone app, which Apple will--
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:21.500]   I'm sure any day now approve hinting that is mind-boggling.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.620]   I mean, it's exactly what you want as a blogger.
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.540]   It is so cool.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.140]   I wish I could show you more, but we will soon.
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.300]   I don't know if this is telling tales out of school,
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:37.060]   but Erica told me it's one icon that Apple approved before,
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:40.580]   but NASA says, no, we don't like that icon that much.
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:44.020]   You got to change an icon.
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.100]   Anyway.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.020]   It could be worse.
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:48.180]   Apple could run book search.
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:48.700]   It's true.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:49.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.500]   You know, it's a very good point.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:52.260]   You want to prove it?
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:52.860]   It's not up.
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:54.980]   That's a very good point.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:55.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:56.260]   I didn't even think of that.
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.380]   It could be worse.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:58.900]   That would be worse.
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.620]   It's interesting how Apple is rapidly becoming
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:03.540]   the new evil empire.
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:04.580]   They used to be the good guys.
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:06.460]   I don't know what happened.
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:09.180]   Now they were just small.
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:12.580]   It's significant enough that eccentricities
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.060]   were considered charming.
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:18.300]   If you can't be good, be insignificant.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:18.780]   Yeah, right.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.420]   OK.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:22.420]   It's a good motto for us all.
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:25.020]   squarespace.com/twegivematri.
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.340]   We appreciate it.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:30.020]   And of course, Jake and Abby appreciated as well.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:35.540]   squarespace.com/tweig.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:36.740]   Yeah, that's a really good point.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.580]   What if Apple were doing this?
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:40.060]   How would people feel?
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.100]   Microsoft did this for a while, a book deal.
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.580]   And of course, it was only public domain books.
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.940]   But I mean, I think that-- no, but did people kind of say,
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.820]   ooh, is Microsoft?
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.420]   No, well, let's also be clear here
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:53.020]   that they're essentially in different businesses, right?
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.740]   Apple is fundamentally a hardware company.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.780]   And so Apple's not going to do anything--
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.340]   Well, they have no interest in doing it.
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:00.900]   --help move hardware, right?
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.140]   And with all the different things
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:04.100]   that Apple's done over the years,
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.300]   that's fundamentally what it's been about.
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:07.940]   They've never deviated from the fact
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:11.780]   that they sell boxes with guts inside.
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:12.860]   So good for them.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:16.220]   And all the problems we have with Apple
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:20.660]   come from the fact that they insist on tethering and limiting
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:23.860]   so many things with their boxes.
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:29.060]   But Microsoft was essentially doing the book scanning
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:32.340]   as a throwaway of public service.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.100]   They never expected to benefit from it directly.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.460]   It was a way of working with Yahoo
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:41.580]   and working with libraries and ultimately with the internet
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:47.540]   archive to essentially have a presence in that that might
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.300]   work out someday.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.220]   But they were never big in it because they sell software.
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.220]   That's their job.
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:56.420]   Google's job is to keep your attention in the Google universe.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:58.420]   And that's why Google was interested in book search
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.260]   for that reason, to give you more reason,
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.580]   to have your eyes on Google, which is good for Google.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:06.020]   But secondly, ideally, to give them much more text
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:06.980]   to analyze.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:10.100]   One of the reasons that their language translation programs
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:13.980]   are such a tremendous success is that they
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:17.780]   are able to crunch so much syntax and figure out
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.460]   how languages work.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:22.740]   And having more text helps Google do that.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.140]   So that's fundamentally what it gets at here.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.900]   So each of these companies has a reason
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:30.100]   to be in the various businesses that they're in.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:35.340]   And Microsoft decided that they had no potential reward
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:39.460]   from doing the book search any longer.
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.900]   And they got out of it.
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.540]   Also, just-- I mean, Google had won.
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:47.180]   Google had made the move that put it head and shoulders above.
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:49.380]   And they just didn't see any reason to continue with it.
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:50.540]   But it was a shame.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.020]   It was actually heartbreaking because they weren't spending
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.020]   that much money.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.820]   It was only a few million bucks a year
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:55.980]   that they were spending on this.
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:57.780]   And it seemed like all changed.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.780]   So it was--
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:08:59.580]   It was an actual--
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.180]   It was an actual translation now that Google's e-book store
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:06.980]   is a stab at all of the proprietary book readers.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:09.260]   Kindle, and I mean, you know, presumably one
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:12.220]   that Apple might have at all because all you need is a browser
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:13.780]   to be able to read books.
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.020]   Well, that's actually all you need right now for a lot of books.
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.060]   And people forget that.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.820]   I mean, the Kindle menu has been driving me nuts,
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:21.540]   because I've just never understood why this--
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.700]   Oh, you don't like the Kindle either?
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:24.580]   I hate it, man.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:27.140]   It's gathering dust downstairs.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:31.380]   It's like this half-baked device that does everything
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.220]   half as well as my laptop does it.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.180]   I just don't get it.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.020]   I mean, the one nice thing about it
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:37.780]   is the kind of connectivity--
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:38.460]   It's a little.
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:39.980]   But it's kind of connectivity with what?
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:40.500]   It's little.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.500]   It's little.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.500]   So it's my laptop.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.980]   I bet I can read it in bed.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:45.700]   Oh, I see.
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:46.780]   Well, you got a book coming out.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.300]   You got to start sucking up down.
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:48.780]   See?
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:49.300]   Amazon.
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:50.300]   You know, that's the thing.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.980]   I would love to write a big slam on Amazon,
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.420]   but it would be the end of my book writing.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.740]   They have way too much power.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:56.780]   Well, now, wait a minute.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.900]   Don't let that hold you back.
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:58.460]   Come on.
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.860]   I'm a publisher when I said that I had once refused
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:02.540]   to go on Oprah.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.540]   They said, she don't say that.
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.980]   Why would anyone refuse to go on Oprah?
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.260]   She's such a nice lady.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:08.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.020]   It was back in the day when she was trying
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.540]   to argue that after having really kind of created
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:16.300]   tabloid television and sleazy television in a way,
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:19.060]   and she suddenly decided that she was all mis-virtuous.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.580]   She wanted TV critics to come on and praise her for it.
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.300]   And I said, oh, thanks.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.980]   No, that's not my job, man.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.300]   I do want to correct myself, Gina,
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.300]   because you're right.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:32.100]   The New York Times article quoted this Arbor Network study
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.820]   as 6% of internet with traffic was Google.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.220]   And I was looking at a Wired article that
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.380]   said close to 10%.
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:40.660]   So I'm trying to figure this out by looking
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.700]   at the Arbor Network study.
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:43.100]   But I think--
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.580]   Yeah, the New York Times article was
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:45.980]   indicated from Read/Write Web.
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:47.660]   I don't know if that makes a difference, but--
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.160]   I do.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:48.660]   Yeah.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:49.660]   No.
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.740]   This is like that moment in jeopardy
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.340]   when they take points away from somebody.
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:54.860]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.620]   Our judges have looked over your answer,
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.980]   and you neglected the question mark.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.580]   Your voice didn't go up at the end,
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.700]   and so you're going to lose all those.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:05.260]   I don't know.
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.300]   I don't know if it's 10 or 6.
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:07.660]   It's still a lot.
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.140]   It's the study's very interesting.
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.660]   I mean, just the points I'm looking at in the study,
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:13.060]   it was a long-term study.
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:17.500]   They did it two years, monitored more than 12 terabits
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:23.260]   a second, 256 exabytes of internet traffic.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.100]   That's insane.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:24.900]   Nothing sane.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.380]   Hard to even imagine that much data.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:28.820]   Unbelievable.
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.220]   So I don't know if you have to buy this study or what.
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.580]   I'm going to see if I can get a copy of it.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:37.300]   It looks like you have to request it somehow.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.140]   All right, it's time for the moment
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.340]   you've all been waiting for, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:44.900]   Gina's tip of the week.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.100]   Mr. Jarvis' number of the week,
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.060]   so if we haven't run through all the numbers.
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.860]   And my tool we have--
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.380]   Well, there's plenty of things.
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.820]   There's lots more, but you've got a minute or two.
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:56.020]   Get another number.
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.700]   And I have a really retro tool of the week,
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.140]   but let's start with Gina.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:00.660]   Cool.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:01.780]   Cool.
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:05.340]   So my tip of the week is for Gmail/Google Docs users.
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:06.500]   The Gmail team's been busy.
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.900]   They've released a few new labs features this week.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:13.020]   And the one I want to feature is a Google Docs preview feature.
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.740]   So in your Gmail account, you go into the lab section,
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.700]   enable Google Docs preview.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.820]   And anytime someone emails you a Google Doc, which is anytime
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.860]   that someone shares a Google Doc with you,
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.980]   you can preview the Google Doc right in line in Gmail.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.900]   And actually, there are quite a few features
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:30.460]   that let you view certain types of content inside Gmail.
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.980]   There's Yelp, there's Flickr, there's Picasso web albums,
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.340]   there's YouTube.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.660]   So Gmail is really sort of moving toward this place
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.860]   where certain kinds of internet content that often
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.980]   get emailed around can be right in line.
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.660]   And Google Docs came out actually this week.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.660]   And kind of as an aside, Wave does a lot of this too.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.940]   It's really interesting to watch Gmail and Google Docs
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:50.460]   get developed in ways where I feel like they're just
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.420]   going to sort of at one point just all merge together
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:53.100]   and be wave.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.340]   But I had to say something about Wave this week,
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:55.980]   so I had to say that.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:00.180]   But check out Gmail Labs in general.
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.620]   The Gmail team's been busy, and there are a lot
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.060]   quite a few new features this week.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.660]   And I'm actually going to have to write up my favorites
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:07.300]   because they're new ones all the time.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.660]   Just run through that list and see
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:09.860]   if there's anything else useful there.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.940]   But Google Docs preview is pretty cool.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.300]   Can I cast a vote for being able to share
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.780]   folders in Google Docs now too?
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:17.180]   Yeah.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:17.740]   You can't.
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:22.700]   That to me was a big feature, but a big feature.
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:25.100]   Because before you had to share a doc at a time,
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.260]   now you can share a folder.
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:28.940]   And that makes it public too, which I think also
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:31.020]   goes to Wave that it becomes a means of publishing.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:31.540]   Right.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.500]   Yep.
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.460]   Oh, that's a very good point.
[01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:35.420]   I didn't even think of that.
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:38.580]   So Google Docs can be a very easy way for anyone
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.700]   to publish to the web now.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:41.340]   Wow.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.500]   Wow.
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:45.700]   It's a very interesting world we live in.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:49.140]   Now, I see some numbers here like the ad sales numbers
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.900]   for Google, but I'm going to let Jeff come up
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.140]   with a number of the week.
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.420]   Well, now I got to find that one.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.100]   You're absolutely right.
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:56.900]   That's the one I should do.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:57.540]   We did zero.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:58.260]   We did 6%.
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.060]   We did all that.
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.220]   Basically, I forget the number.
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:05.460]   So to heck with it, the Google's numbers were up.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:08.420]   It's stock is up as a result, which I'm happy about.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:12.260]   And it's also good for the economy, one says.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.420]   And the indication is that clicks are up means
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.700]   the consumers are looking around for things again.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:19.140]   And it also says that Google is going
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:22.500]   to start investing once again in new companies.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.900]   And I think that's probably good for the industry.
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:26.380]   We'll see what they want to buy.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.660]   Maybe we should do a wish list.
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.380]   I don't have anything on top of a wish list of what
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:32.220]   should Google buy.
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:33.500]   We were going to do that.
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.220]   I really like that idea.
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:39.740]   They said the net income of $1.64 billion--
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.580]   that's up 8% from last year.
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:45.500]   Revenue was $5.94 billion.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.260]   And that excludes commissions paid to advertising partners.
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.660]   But that's a lot of ads.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.180]   That's amazing.
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.620]   And they beat the forecast, which is probably
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:56.460]   why they're at $5.53.
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:00.820]   My tool of the week is something you all know and have used.
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:03.220]   But for some reason, I've kind of ignored it.
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.900]   I've always recommended Picasa.
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.540]   I like Picasa a lot.
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:09.540]   And Picasa Web and the Mac version of Picasa I tried,
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:13.460]   they just updated it to, I think, $3.5 last month.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:15.740]   And they just are doing a-- they're just, I think,
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:16.820]   really doing a great job.
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.780]   This is rapidly becoming--
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:22.740]   certainly it's better than anything that's native to--
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.500]   comes with Windows or the Mac and touch much better than iPhoto.
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.300]   But it's even starting to compete with commercial products
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:32.420]   like Lightroom and Aperture in the ability to modify photos.
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:33.700]   And they've added now something they've
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.620]   had on the web for a while in Picasa Web.
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:41.460]   They've added now face recognition to the Picasa download.
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:41.820]   And that--
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.260]   I mentioned this last week when you were--
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.260]   You did?
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.260]   This was my tip of the week, which review
[01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:50.180]   your evolution of hairstyles.
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:52.580]   Oh, that's a good tip.
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:54.620]   That's a good tip.
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.300]   It does a good job, doesn't it?
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:16:00.020]   It does a great job, better with adults than babies.
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.460]   I didn't try it with babies.
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:02.300]   I had my nephews.
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.300]   Like my three nephews all look really alike when they are.
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.900]   You're shooting me upside down.
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:06.460]   You should have--
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:07.740]   You should have a monkey at you.
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:08.540]   Well, it's my fault.
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:11.820]   I should have listened to the show before I did my tip.
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:12.340]   But--
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:14.260]   It shows how much confidence you had that Jeff nailed it.
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:14.740]   Where she did--
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:15.180]   I knew he did.
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:16.060]   I knew he did.
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.980]   But I have to say, I downloaded it to try that.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:21.140]   But then I'm going through Picasa.
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:24.500]   And it's just really getting better and better and better.
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.020]   If you're looking for-- it actually
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:28.300]   came up because somebody left a message on a friend feed
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:32.420]   said, I'm looking for a good photo sharing service that's
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:32.860]   free.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.140]   And this is pretty good.
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.940]   In fact, it was so good that I end up spending $75 to upgrade it
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.900]   to 40 gigabytes of storage.
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.900]   So the web albums, really.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:41.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:42.300]   Nice.
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:42.980]   I really like it.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:44.700]   Well, I just think this is going to be a good way for me
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.460]   to share stuff.
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:50.900]   I'm always-- with the kids, team sports and graduation
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:53.380]   and prom pictures and all that, I'm always sharing photo albums
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:54.620]   with other parents.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:57.380]   And you need an easy to use, simple way to do that.
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.300]   And I have been using smug mug, but I think it's really
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:02.580]   off-putting sometimes to newbies.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:05.260]   But Google Web, Picasa Web, that's easy.
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.500]   It's very straightforward.
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.860]   Anyway, so much for my tool of the week.
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:10.940]   Sorry, Leo.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:12.180]   It's OK.
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:14.700]   I had a little tip of the week, so I got a little in on yours,
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.500]   so that's OK.
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.220]   Hey, Siva, thank you so much for being with us.
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:19.900]   I really appreciate it.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:24.540]   Siva is a professor of stuff like this.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.060]   New media, I guess, is the best way to do it.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:27.740]   Anything you want.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:28.700]   We'll teach for food.
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.740]   Yeah, law, media, whatever.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.620]   And I love your contrary and point of view,
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.020]   we should get you on here more often,
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.140]   because we're just a bunch of Google lovers,
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:39.620]   and it's about time about somebody.
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:40.580]   Yes, I am, too.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.700]   And I'm not even a jilted lover.
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:48.860]   But look, who knows your flaws and overstatements more
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.220]   than your most beloved?
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:52.180]   Who loves you?
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:58.060]   So well, he does think that Larry Page is disingenuous.
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:17:59.220]   I don't know if I can go for it.
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:00.060]   Well, a sergeus.
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.940]   A sergeus.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:04.060]   Well, anyway, thank you for being here.
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.220]   We'll have you back soon.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.420]   I really enjoyed--
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:07.780]   Thanks for the opportunity.
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:08.980]   --your thoughts.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:11.140]   And of course, Googleizationofeverything.com
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:11.780]   is a place to go.
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.900]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.500]   And of course, writes for Life Hacker and the Harvard Business
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.380]   Review, and a lot of other places as well.
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.620]   And it's always great to have you on.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:22.220]   Thank you for being here, Gina.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:22.720]   Thank you.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.220]   Great show.
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:26.780]   Jeff Jarvis at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:28.340]   I keep seeing all of this.
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:29.740]   It's not a nonprofit.
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:30.740]   Let's not--
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:31.340]   No, no, no, no.
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.580]   Let's not see that.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.020]   It's a small profit.
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:36.060]   It's a nano profit.
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:40.380]   And do read his most recent penis post, because--
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.220]   I was hoping you were going to say book, Leo.
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:42.740]   I'm sorry.
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:43.340]   And the book.
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:43.940]   Where's the book?
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.500]   I have the book.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:44.980]   There it is.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:45.740]   Hold up the book.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.660]   What would Google do?
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:48.900]   I'm sure it's selling very well.
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:50.500]   And it is available in Audible as well,
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:51.460]   if you'd like to listen.
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:54.980]   OK.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.340]   It is not TMI.
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:58.540]   It is just good information.
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:00.220]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:01.140]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:03.500]   We'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:07.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:10.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:13.120]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.700]   (upbeat music)
