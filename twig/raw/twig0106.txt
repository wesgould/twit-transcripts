[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.320]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.200]   to show the covers Google, the cloud, and pretty much everything
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.400]   going on on the internet.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.960]   I am not Leo LaPorte.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.280]   He is actually awaiting rejection from jury duty.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.960]   He said he's actually twiddling his thumb support guy.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.480]   But I'm filling in for him.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.040]   Happy to be here joining us, as always, the regulars.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.560]   Glad to have Gina Trapani from smarterware.org.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.840]   How's it going, Gina?
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.200]   Howdy.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.840]   It's going great.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.560]   Good to see you, Tom.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.640]   Good to see you, too.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.680]   And Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.960]   How you doing, Jeff?
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.560]   I'm pink, as always.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.800]   I'm going to figure out this damn camera thing,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.920]   so I haven't figured it out.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.040]   Believe us, Jeff is in the pink.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.520]   We're very happy also to be joined by Douglas Edwards,
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.560]   former Googler and author of the book
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.040]   "I'm Feeling Lucky-- The Confessions of Google
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.520]   Employee Number 59."
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.720]   Welcome, Doug.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.080]   Thank you for having me.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.400]   Now, I was thrown into this at the last minute,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.000]   so I'm ill-prepared, hoping Gina and Jeff can save me
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.760]   in talking to you, Doug.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.920]   But employee number 59, just to get us started,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.480]   explain where that fit in.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.640]   What was that like?
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.240]   What were you doing when you started at Google?
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.960]   Well, I have been working for the San Jose Mercury News
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.480]   for seven and a half years, and was doing brand management
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.800]   for online products for them when I left,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.720]   and came to Google expecting that it would be different
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.000]   from the Mercury News, which is 150-year-old,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.800]   night-reader corporate entity.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.880]   And so I showed up at Google for the interview,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.360]   and of course, Sergey Brin interviewed me
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.280]   and was wearing his roller skates and his hockey shorts,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.120]   and his hockey t-shirt, and had it already come in
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.600]   from playing outside.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.160]   It didn't bother to take a shower first,
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.720]   which I appreciated.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.120]   And it was a completely different feel from right
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.840]   from the interview on the questions he asked,
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.520]   and then the experience of actually joining the company
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.240]   was quite different from what I had expected,
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.960]   even knowing that in Silicon Valley
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   it was going to be different from what I had left.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.640]   And so the book itself is just--
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.880]   is it a tell-all of all the secrets behind Google
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.240]   and what makes them so fantastically successful?
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   Or is it--
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.040]   Not all.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.400]   It's a tell-some.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.160]   It's a tell-some.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   I like that.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.600]   Yeah, it's a little bit of a history of the company
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.560]   in terms of the major decisions that they made
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.760]   around certain product launches.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.600]   But more than that, it's my tale of how it felt
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.920]   to be part of Google when it was fewer than 60 people.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.480]   And it's hard to explain, just talking about it.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.920]   But it was a very unusual place to be in terms of the energy
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.440]   level of the people who were there,
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.840]   what they were trying to accomplish,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.640]   certainly the personalities of the founders
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.080]   and the other engineers made it unique in my experience.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.000]   And it was just my attempt to capture in words
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.600]   how that felt, which you had to kind of have been there
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.760]   to really experience.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.600]   You started there in 1999 when you could probably
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.080]   all fit in one picture.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.680]   And then you left in 2005 when the place was gargantuan.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.640]   What was it like when you left?
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.280]   Did you feel like you were jumping ship too early?
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.120]   Did you feel like it was the right time?
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.760]   And why did you leave?
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.320]   Well, certainly the right time for me.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.200]   And there were a confluence of different trends
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.080]   that happened to come together at that point in time.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.080]   I'd already been there for more than five years.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.360]   And so five years of working startup hours
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.600]   started to take a toll on me.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.360]   And I had three children at home
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.880]   that I hadn't seen all that much of and decided
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.000]   they would like to see more of.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.880]   But also the corporate culture was shifting.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.200]   My boss, who had been there from the beginning,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.320]   also left at the end of 2004.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.880]   And she and I were very some pot of co.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.760]   And when she left, I was going to be reorganized
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.120]   into a different part of the company
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.120]   that was a lot more metrics driven and less--
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.680]   I don't want to say less fun, but certainly less focused
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.720]   on the things that I enjoyed doing
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.680]   from a brand management standpoint.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.440]   So between that and the time commitment
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.360]   and the fact that Google had gone public
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.120]   and because of the shares I own,
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.800]   I no longer had the burn urgency or need
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.680]   to generate a paycheck every month.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.040]   It was-- it seemed like a good time
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.200]   to make a transition out.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.280]   Have you sold your shares?
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.640]   I sold most of them, yes.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.480]   You did?
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.360]   Probably earlier than I should have.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.160]   But for me, it was a simple equation.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.440]   I mean, having known Larry and Sergey as the kind of guys
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.520]   who like to go helicopter skiing and take unreasonable risks,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.760]   I decided it was probably a good idea
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.360]   to take the burden of the hand instead of the--
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   Didn't you give a book talk at the Plex like two weeks ago?
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.360]   I did, yeah.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.160]   More of the book.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.360]   So how has the reaction been to the book from inside?
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.520]   You know, Google has been great all the way through this.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.160]   They've really helped me out in terms
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.240]   of providing access to current Google staff.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.400]   And a lot of the people I work with are still there
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.920]   and I wanted to talk to them.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.920]   And Google could have made it very difficult for me.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.920]   They could have said, no, we're not
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.680]   going to provide you access to these people
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.880]   or because of the nondisclosure agreement I signed
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.160]   as an employee, they could have said,
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.440]   you can't write about it at all.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.920]   Sure.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.120]   And they didn't do any of that.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.960]   So I was really quite happy.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.160]   And then the reaction, for the most part,
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.440]   from the people I've talked to has been very positive.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.440]   They did invite me back on campus to give a Google talk.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.360]   And so the reaction has been much better than I actually
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.960]   anticipated.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.640]   I love that the book is--
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.640]   I'm sorry, Tom.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.520]   No, go ahead.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.040]   Go ahead.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.920]   Oh, sorry, Jeff.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.600]   I was going to say, I really enjoyed the book.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.880]   I like the conversational tone.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.360]   You kind of come at it as like this kind of regular guy.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.280]   And you imagine that the first 60 employees of Google
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.400]   were sort of 20-something, just graduated engineers.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.040]   But you were 41, I think, at the time when you started.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.200]   You were marketing.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.800]   So you were kind of coming at it from like, hey,
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.000]   I've been covering all these startups.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.680]   I wanted to find the next big thing.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.520]   And I wound up at Google.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.920]   And the title, I'm feeling lucky,
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.240]   was that there was some irony there
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.480]   that this just sort of happened, but by chance,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.320]   from some of the anecdote that you tell.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   It sounds that way.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.080]   I wish I could claim this incredible foresight
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.200]   in picking Google among all of the startups that I talked to.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.520]   But it really just kind of worked out
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   that they were the ones who offered me the job that
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.560]   seemed most interesting.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.160]   And I talked to Yahoo, and they offered me a position.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.600]   But it just didn't feel--
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.920]   Oh, are you lucky?
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.160]   I already felt in 1999, like the moment it passed,
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   Yahoo was clearly a very large company.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.560]   And I really wanted to get in on a small company.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.640]   And I found out that the reason they were even hiring
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.640]   marketing people is because somebody on the board
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.960]   had told them that you need some marketing people.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.160]   You need somebody to do this stuff that isn't engineering.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.720]   All that stuff you don't want to do,
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.160]   you need some people in the company to do that.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.480]   They went out basically and said, OK,
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.400]   we'll get some marketing people.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.960]   But they didn't really have a clear idea
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.760]   of what marketing people did or should do for Google.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.320]   And that was a little confusing for me when I showed up.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.240]   And there was no job description and no clear expectations
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.440]   about what my job would be.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.920]   This is a personal question because I
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.880]   come from your two last worlds, working around the internet
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.000]   and tech now, but still in newspapers.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.200]   Speaking of feeling lucky to be out of the Titanic,
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.160]   what was the contrast like then?
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.640]   And I mean, how do you feel now seeing your old ship
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.480]   with just its mast above the water versus what you did next?
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.080]   Well, I still subscribe to both the Mercury News
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.000]   and the New York Times.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.840]   And I enjoy very much getting a print paper delivered
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.360]   in my driveway every morning, even if I have to dig it out
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.960]   of the bushes sometimes.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.600]   But even at the end of '99, it was clear to me.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.360]   And part of the reason I left the mark
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   was that they really were struggling
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.560]   to understand this new internet world.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.160]   And I thought, well, I'll go off.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.640]   I'll join a startup.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.680]   It'll probably go out of business in 12 months.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.520]   And then I'll come back to corporate newspapers.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.120]   And I'll be the in-house internet guy.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.560]   I'll have gained my stripes.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.480]   I'll have some expertise and what
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.920]   it's like to be in an internet startup.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.640]   And then I can bring that back to the newspaper
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.600]   and leverage that into some kind of position.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.200]   I didn't realize that the newspapers would be gone in 12
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.800]   months.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.600]   It was pretty surprising how quickly things turn south.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.200]   But I could see.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.600]   I mean, Night Ritter in particular
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.520]   was really focused on protecting their print classified
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.080]   product, because it was just such an enormously high margin
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.600]   business.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   And so everything they did online
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.640]   was geared towards getting people to buy ads
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.160]   in the classified section of the Mercury News.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.680]   And so that did not feel like an ultimately winning strategy
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.200]   to me.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.160]   And I just--
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160]   I probably needed to try something else.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.560]   Now, did that scare you at all that Google and to this day
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.280]   still relies entirely on one source of income?
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.880]   Advertising on search is their big cash cow,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.920]   similar to the position the newspapers were in there.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.280]   Big cash cow is classifieds.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.440]   It's never a good thing to have all of your eggs in one basket,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:33.800]   I think.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   But the difference is that Google isn't sitting still
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.640]   trying to protect online advertising.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.800]   They're constantly innovating within the advertising itself.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.520]   They're expanding into video ads and brand-based ads.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.040]   And ad networks.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.240]   And advertising is a very large field.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.440]   And I think they've diversified quite a bit
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.920]   within the advertising space.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.000]   Whereas Night Ritter had a hard time, I think, at least
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.040]   from my perspective, in expanding
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.360]   beyond just the print version of Classify.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.240]   They tried a lot of things online,
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.040]   but they were not really successful.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.360]   And I think ultimately it was because they kept bringing
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.720]   the classified model from newspapers
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   to the online space.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.320]   I have to say, having worked in an industry,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.400]   I worked in television as the web guy,
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.560]   it is really hard to turn that boat.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:32.000]   It's really hard to get people to understand
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.800]   how a new system works and how it can work for them,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.640]   because they have their own preconceived notions.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.680]   Was that a relief working at Google?
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.800]   Or did you start to run in as it got bigger
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.840]   to some of those same sorts of situations?
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.960]   Now, it was such a reversal of what I had been living.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.040]   At the Merck, they had a separate database
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.160]   for classified ads, for print for display ads.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.600]   They had a database for the newspaper, for the editorial.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.880]   They had a circulation database, none of which
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.680]   talked to each other.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.240]   There was no interaction among the different technologies
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.080]   within the company.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.080]   And I went to Google, and everything
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.280]   was built from the ground up, and it all worked together.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.760]   There were none of these legacy issues.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.760]   You didn't have to worry about whether something new would
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.800]   work with something old, because if there were ever a problem,
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.680]   it was all online.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.160]   They could just fix it in the back end,
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.280]   and the user would experience it as if it were a continuously
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.960]   upgraded product.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.760]   But I came to Google thinking, all right,
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.440]   I'm older than these kids.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.440]   I'm 41.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.880]   I've had 20 plus years experience in marketing.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.520]   I'll come in, and I'll show them how this is done.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.360]   And that's not exactly how they viewed my position
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.000]   in the company.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.240]   So that took a little getting used to the idea
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.320]   that everything that I knew to be true was actually wrong,
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.440]   and that I needed to start from scratch and unlearn.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.520]   Not just start from zero, but actually go back and unlearn
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:06.160]   all of the things that I thought were absolute in marketing.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.640]   So you've mentioned that you waited six years to write the book,
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.200]   and you said that one of the interviews that you finally
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.560]   realized you had to take me through that.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.520]   Why did you wait so long, and why did you have to?
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.200]   Well, when I left Google, I immediately
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.000]   thought, oh, I'll write a book about my experience.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.880]   And so then I said, well, you know, I was at Google.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.680]   I want to do something nontraditional.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.400]   I'll just blog my experience.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.560]   And I set up that Zumbler's blog back in 2005,
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.520]   and it was just pouring a lot of stories into it and so forth.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.480]   And it started to feel like work.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.280]   And when I would take a week off and not post anything,
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.320]   people would be emailing me.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.880]   What do you do to post again?
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.920]   What's going on?
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.040]   Are you abandoning this?
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.320]   And the pressure to continuously update it
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.320]   started to become a little annoying.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.720]   So I said, all right, I'm just going to quit.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.560]   I'm just going to give it up and just move on with life.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.880]   And I went on and did some other things.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.720]   But everywhere I looked, Google was a presence.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.480]   Online, certainly, it's everywhere.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.600]   But TV, and print, on the radio.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.160]   And every time I heard Google mention,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.080]   this little ding would go off in my head.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.280]   And I'm like, oh, yeah, remember the story behind that?
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.560]   And how we got to that space?
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:23.280]   Or somebody would be giving some lengthy explanation
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.040]   from an outside perspective of what Google was about.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.600]   And I'd say, well, that's not exactly accurate.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.640]   So I finally decided, well, if you're
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.360]   going to get this out of your head,
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.760]   I had to write it down.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.600]   The only way to get it done was to write it down.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.400]   So I started working on the book about two and a half years
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:38.760]   ago.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.520]   And if I had known how long it was going to take,
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.520]   I certainly would not have embarked on the jury.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.560]   It was just a lot of interviewing
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.680]   and both current Googlers and ex-Googlers,
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.360]   a lot of trying to recreate the timeline of things that
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.360]   happened.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.760]   And finally, when I had written over 500 pages,
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.440]   and my editors started choking on it and said,
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.280]   that's probably enough for now.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.560]   They cut it down by 100.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.560]   They probably should have cut it down by 150.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.440]   But I think they wanted to actually
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.400]   have it see the light of day at some point in this century.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.560]   So I've asked you in the chat room what they want to know.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.480]   And the first question up is, what do you think of Google+,?
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.840]   Do you have an account?
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.120]   Of course.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.400]   I do like Google+, and it's been--
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.040]   I have been AB testing with Facebook.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.560]   I'll post something on Facebook, and then I'll post--
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.360]   and I've had a Facebook account for a long time,
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.120]   a personal one.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.720]   And then I'll post something on Google+,
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.480]   and see where I get more reaction or how quickly
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.720]   I hear from people.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   I mean, the thing that's amazing to me, though,
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:47.160]   is that not so much Facebook, but Twitter, which I had set up
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.080]   an early account on Twitter, a personal account,
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.000]   and never used it.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.240]   And I understand it's very valuable to a lot of people.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.200]   But for me, personally, I didn't need it.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.000]   And then when I wrote the book, I said, OK,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   I'll set up one to talk about the book and Google issues.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.840]   And over a period of a few months,
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.240]   I built up, I think, 300 or 400 Twitter followers.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.080]   And that seemed like a fair number of people.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.040]   I was on Google+, for a week, and I had 1,500 followers.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.160]   People I didn't know from all over the world,
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.440]   and I'm like, why?
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.640]   Why are these people signing up to follow me on Google+,
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.120]   but just the difference in the scale really impressed me,
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.720]   considering how few people--
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.560]   I mean, 20 million people are on Google+,
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.040]   but compared to Facebook, it's not that many.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:36.240]   So yeah, I've been impressed with what they've accomplished
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.800]   so far.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.720]   Your A/B testing Facebook versus Google+,
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.480]   which is funny, because you said you had to unlearn everything.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.440]   And you emphasized in the book how Google's
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.760]   such a data-driven company.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.840]   And I think that question of, what do you
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.640]   think of Google+ is kind of a bigger question of,
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.880]   do you think that a company that's
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.920]   mastered this data-driven algorithmic approach
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.640]   or indexing content has the capacity
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.120]   to do the same for people?
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.960]   Yeah, this is the big challenge for Google,
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.880]   because I think they will continue
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.040]   to develop great technologies to plug into Google+.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.080]   But the human intelligence that goes along with it,
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.560]   that Facebook seems to have really understood
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.520]   what people are looking for in a social network.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.960]   I'm not convinced Google is going to be as quick to grasp
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.080]   that.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.720]   I'm hoping that they're going to bring some people
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.640]   into the company who are, as I said,
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.240]   in one interview, a little more irrational, like normal people.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.000]   And not just completely driven by metrics and logic
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.840]   and coding hygiene.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.360]   And this is the way you do things,
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.600]   because that's not the way people operate in the real world.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.040]   People do things that don't seem all that logical in the surface,
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.880]   but make perfect sense to them.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.120]   So I'd like to see Google bring in some of those folks,
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.120]   and possibly the impact of that
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.440]   would be to have a better social networking product.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.600]   You told a story earlier in the book
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.640]   about how you were having a conversation with Larry,
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.400]   I think it was.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.600]   And you had lost an argument, and you
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.760]   were going back to make amends, and you said, looking back,
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.560]   I know more often than not, you've been right.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.360]   So I just wanted to let you know that I knew that.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.000]   And he looked at you and said, well, when have we been wrong?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.280]   And not in an offended way, but in a way
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.360]   that he wanted to--
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.160]   You know, kind of been a robotic way.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.080]   I'm just going to move me away.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:26.040]   I'm doing this all day long, and I appreciate how smart you are
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.960]   and everything.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.920]   And you were appealing to his emotion,
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.360]   and he wanted more signals for his internal algorithm.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.880]   And I thought that was very, very telling.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.040]   He was really puzzled that anybody would think
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.720]   that he'd actually been wrong about anything.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.960]   Because as far as he could tell, he'd never been wrong
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.640]   about anything before.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.280]   Everything was clearly moving exactly the way it should be.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.080]   Well, and I get the sense it's not out of pride,
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.800]   but out of assurity.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.000]   Like, we have followed the algorithm.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.160]   And the algorithm works.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.000]   So point out the error in my code.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.500]   Exactly.
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.320]   I've written a good program here.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.720]   You show me where it's flawed.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.560]   I mean, the output is exactly what I expected and desired.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.040]   So I don't see where there's any problem with it.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.720]   One of the criticisms I hear the most often about Google
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.120]   these days anyway is that they don't have a good customer
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.160]   service presence, that it's hard to get an answer from somebody.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.480]   It's hard to get some response when you have a problem.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.920]   Do you think that that has its roots in that engineering
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.880]   basis of it?
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.680]   They seem to be trying to get better at that.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.720]   They've been doing a lot with Google+ at public outreach.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.960]   But it's one of the areas that they need to catch up.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.320]   But I talk about that in length in the book.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.960]   In terms of, I was in charge of customer service,
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.120]   because clearly customer service was not engineering,
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.560]   so it must be marketing.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.040]   So I was handed here.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.240]   You do fast for a little--
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.200]   Yeah, right.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.680]   Well, but that is very zappos.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.280]   That's very zappos, Doc.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.840]   I mean, customer service is the new marketing.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.040]   Well, that's not the way they looked at it.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.880]   They looked at it.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.640]   It was an interesting non-engineering function.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.920]   So we think that is an engineering I want to deal with.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.120]   And there was one guy using Microsoft Outlook
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.720]   to respond to tens of thousands of users,
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.240]   and that quickly became overwhelming.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.760]   But Larian said, we would fall behind,
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.120]   and we'd have these cues filled of email comments
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.520]   from people who we were trying to get back to within 24 hours.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.120]   And what-- when I went to Larian's survey and complained,
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.880]   it's that we need more people to deal with customer service.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.840]   And they say, well, we shouldn't even
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.920]   be answering customer service emails,
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.480]   because if they're calling to complement us,
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.520]   they already love us.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.120]   We don't need to send them a note back.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:40.960]   They already like us.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.280]   So mission accomplished.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.720]   Or if they're calling to complain,
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.800]   if there's a technical issue, then it's
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.200]   far better to take our resources and allocate them
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.760]   to solving the problem that they've identified,
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.560]   rather than emailing them back to tell them,
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.600]   oh, we're going to work on that problem for you.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.120]   So it was a resource allocation question.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.120]   So they never saw any need to respond to email.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.280]   And in fact, at one point, they suggested
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.200]   just writing a program that would randomly generate responses
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.920]   and send them out.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.080]   And in fact, in that attempt, that response
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.840]   is going to be just fine.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.680]   So--
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.360]   Efficiency above all.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:13.680]   They should--
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.200]   They should--
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.400]   I guess you have to pitch it as any customer service email
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.080]   is a search query.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.160]   And how are we going to respond to that?
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.240]   Well, they didn't buy that.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.400]   They didn't just--
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.160]   And you know, Cheryl Sandberg, who went off to Facebook,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.680]   is COO.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.840]   She talked about trying to respond to queries and Facebook.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.520]   And she ultimately came to the same conclusion
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.840]   that Larry and Sergey did, I think,
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.600]   that it doesn't make sense to answer every email
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.400]   that somebody sends to you.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.440]   It's just not efficient.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.640]   It's too easy for people to vent themselves through email.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.760]   And the question of whether or not all emails are equally
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.480]   important and urgent is one I think companies have to deal with.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.200]   Well, especially when you're getting at that level,
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.600]   the risk you run, though, is that you end up
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.400]   with these people ranting in public
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.080]   because they feel slighted, whether it's justified or not.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.480]   And you may or may not suffer from the fallout from that.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.440]   I mean, if there's critical mass of people
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.200]   complaining about one feature or an inability
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.600]   to use the service, then clearly you have a real problem.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.640]   And you need to address it.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.800]   And certainly some of the stuff that came up around privacy,
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.160]   I think, that in particular is an area where you do need
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.040]   to be very responsive.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.160]   Or you can start getting a very bad vibe
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.760]   spreading about your product.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.400]   Before we wrap up, Gina, any more follow-up questions?
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.600]   I have to say that when I read the beginning of the book
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.480]   about your interview with Google, Warren Sergey,
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.000]   said to you, I'm going to go to the candy machine now.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.920]   And I'm going to give you five minutes to think about something
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.040]   really complex.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.480]   And I expect you to explain it to me for an hour when I return.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.200]   I spent a long time thinking about what I would--
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.080]   what I would be explaining to him.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.640]   And that sounded-- that's how I've heard
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.880]   that Google interviews are scary.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.760]   That sounded really scary, even though it was kind of back
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.640]   to me.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.680]   It was a tough one because he wanted me to tell him something
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.020]   he didn't already know so that he wouldn't be wasting his time
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.920]   if they didn't hire me.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.400]   At least he'd get some knowledge out of it.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.360]   And I had no idea what he knew.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:14.960]   Right.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.280]   Right.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.400]   So Cindy McCaffrey, who was head of marketing PR, said,
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.800]   I mean, he's interested in everything.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.040]   So you can talk about anything.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.780]   It doesn't have to be related to technology.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.560]   So it gave me a leeway.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.680]   Obviously you nailed it.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.640]   I think Cindy probably felt like--
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.240]   I did OK.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.160]   I'm not sure if Sarah did, you know, I agree.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.560]   But I knew that he needed some marketing people.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.920]   And Cindy said hi, and so I think he--
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.840]   He didn't get in the way.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.920]   So the other question the chat room wants to know is,
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.240]   what kind of phone do you use?
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.080]   I have an iPhone version of 3GS.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.680]   Although my son is all about the droid,
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.400]   and he's very happy with his.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.880]   So we're sort of a mixed family when it comes to technology.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.280]   So I'm curious, because here you are head of marketing,
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.960]   the company that grew to be huge,
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.120]   the fastest-growing brand in the world with no marketing,
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.400]   and having come from an industry based on marketing,
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.140]   now that Google has the Android and is starting
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:19.560]   to market some products, how do you think they're doing?
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.440]   You know, I can't say that I have a real solid sense of Android
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.280]   as a brand.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.720]   You know, I mean, it feels more like the old Intel
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.920]   inside kind of things, where it's an ingredient.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.120]   And so I don't have a--
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.080]   I'm aware of Android as a presence in the market.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.000]   But it seems kind of fractured to me.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.480]   I don't have a very concrete sense,
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.760]   whereas with Apple, you always know exactly what
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.200]   you're looking at, which is basically Steve's job's vision
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.960]   implemented in hardware and software.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.600]   And with Android, it feels a lot more amorphous to me.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.960]   So I can't say that I have a strong sense of Android
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.560]   as a brand.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.800]   Although, if I do associate any qualities with it,
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.560]   it's that it's fast and very innovative
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.920]   and continuing to evolve.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.920]   So I'd say that it's still got some rooms
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.320]   that grow as a marketing concept.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.720]   That's fair.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.360]   Any more questions before we let Doug go?
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.400]   Thank you for coming on the show.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.160]   It was great to have you.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.080]   Yeah, thank you so much.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.320]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.040]   We've been looking forward to this.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.240]   Doug is the author of "I'm Feeling Lucky,
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.760]   the Confessions of Google Employee Number 59,
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.280]   Available Bookstores Everywhere."
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.360]   Easily found online.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.160]   Do a search on Google.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:35.840]   It'll come up with it.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.440]   Thank you, Doug.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.880]   We really appreciate you taking the time to chat with us.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.240]   I have my pleasure.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.280]   Thanks, Doug.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.120]   I really like the Zooglers site, too.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.000]   I'm going to check that out.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   I know you said you need to post more on it,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.600]   but that's the ex-Googlers reminiscing.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:54.200]   So check that out as well as x-o-o-g-l-e-r-s.blogspot.com.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.600]   Well, related news.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.440]   And the list to hear, Tom, is that Google got rid of its Google
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.800]   Friends newsletter.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.280]   What was the Google Friends newsletter?
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:09.040]   It was an early, early newsletter.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.640]   People talking to-- maybe Doug's still on.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.880]   Maybe you can tell us what it was in the early days.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.280]   Yeah, Doug said you're still there.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:15.480]   What's--
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.000]   I'm still there.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.800]   Larry started that back when they were in Stanford.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.440]   And it would be just him talking about new machines
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.680]   that they bought, or that they were going to Burning Man
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.160]   or whatever.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.280]   And so don't bother sending him an email.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.680]   Not that he would have answered it anyway.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   But--
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.120]   And that became one of my responsibilities.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.360]   I had to start writing the Google Friends newsletter.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.000]   And it was supposed to be a monthly--
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.640]   I think we ultimately went to buy monthly--
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.480]   with updates about all the Google products.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.800]   And it went to any user who signed up for it
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.040]   and who was interested in learning more about Google.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.760]   So it was a real pain to write, too,
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.920]   because Larry and Sergey always like to have a red pen on it.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.600]   And they make a lot of changes.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.040]   Was anyone subscribed, Jeff, or you subscribed to it?
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:06.640]   No, I wasn't.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.600]   I didn't know about it until it died.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.240]   Yeah, no, I know.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:09.760]   Me too.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.840]   And you were a book about Google.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.960]   So I didn't-- I wonder if Leo was subscribed.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.920]   I hadn't heard of it until it died.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.440]   And then I said, oh.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.120]   There were so much of that.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.160]   There were 30,000 subscribers back in 2001, 2002.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.680]   So I mean, it had--
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.480]   It's good size.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.440]   --fairy leadership.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:27.940]   Yeah.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.400]   I mean, I'm sure it grew quite a bit since then.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.360]   Well, they claim the number of subscribers
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.640]   has remained flat because they have so many other ways
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.520]   of communicating the official Google blog, Twitter, and such.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.280]   So they've concluded the format is no longer the best way
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.960]   to get the word out.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.520]   Well, the blog-- you know, the launch of the blog,
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.920]   that was a really harrowing experience.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.200]   That happened during the quiet period
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.560]   and right before the IPO.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.760]   And so the original Google blog, you know,
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.960]   there were questions about whether we could even do that.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.680]   But ultimately, we-- you know, as Google often did,
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.840]   pushed ahead without too much fear of legal ramifications.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.200]   Full speed ahead.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   That's so crazy.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.680]   Can't have a company blog.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.880]   I mean, that seems like-- you know, now, in this day and age,
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.720]   it's like such a funny--
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.440]   Mr. Foney, you know, did a question.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.320]   The fact that we hadn't done it previously,
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.360]   that we were launching a new communication vehicle
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.800]   during the quiet period.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.800]   Right.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.040]   Which was when it-- it was not that we couldn't do a blog.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.560]   And we could certainly do it after the IPO.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.560]   Right.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.240]   The only blogger-- I mean, we had bought
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.400]   Pimer Labs, which was blogger.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.120]   So we were using our own technology to do it.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.520]   But, you know, there were-- so the first post
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.160]   were things like Charlie Ehr is fried chicken recipe.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.480]   The first thing is, fried and noncontroversial,
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.240]   unlikely to inflate the stock and artificial--
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.640]   That fried chicken recipe was pretty good.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   It was the end of it.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.320]   You never know.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   That could happen.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.320]   That could happen.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.400]   That recipe from Elvis Presley's personal chef.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.440]   And so it was the same fried chicken Elvis
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.400]   in the current state.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:03.640]   All right.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.960]   Well, we will let you go now, Doug.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.400]   But thanks again so much for talking to us.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.240]   We really appreciate it.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.520]   All right.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.960]   Take care.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   Oh, we got to take a break before we get into the news
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.320]   and thank our sponsor Squarespace.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.600]   Squarespace.com, the fast and easy way
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.960]   to create a high quality website or blog.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.080]   Easy to use UI for creating and managing a website
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.600]   optimized for beginners and CSS experts.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.560]   So if you don't know what CSS is, you don't need to.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.960]   You can still use Squarespace.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.880]   It's drag and drop.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.200]   You put your modules in.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.320]   You write what you want.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.800]   You put it where you want on the page.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.480]   It's what you see is going to be on the page.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.560]   But if you do know what CSS is, you
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.640]   can get in there and edit the code behind the module.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.240]   In fact, one of the things I'd like when I'm creating posts
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.520]   in Squarespace, you can either go in the raw HTML
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.080]   and edit it there and do the coding yourself.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.720]   And they give you some tools that allow you
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.760]   to highlight and put in links easily.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.240]   But if you're not, if you're in the more visual interface,
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.920]   you can still click a button that says,
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.400]   just show me the HTML really quick
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.640]   so I can make a small tweak and then go right back.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.200]   It's really easy to flip back and forth between it.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:09.840]   We love it.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.880]   I use it for forecast.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.760]   I use it for sword and laser.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.200]   And it's easy to move into.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.720]   If you're on-blog or moveable type, type pad, word press,
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.600]   you can export your data into Squarespace and try it out.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.200]   In fact, you can try it out for free,
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.280]   thanks to the fact that you're watching Twig.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.400]   See if you like it.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.000]   And if you don't like it, you can export your data
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.840]   right back out again.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.560]   Squarespace doesn't want to lock you in.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.840]   They're pretty sure you're going to like it.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.400]   So they're willing to swear by data portability.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.280]   Try it out right now.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.800]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.880]   Just you can go start any site you want.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:45.440]   You can throw up-- I was employee60.squarespace.com
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.560]   right now.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.680]   No credit card needed.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.600]   And if you decide to purchase the Squarespace service
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.720]   after the free trial, use the offer code--
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.680]   What is our offer code?
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.200]   I think it's Twig.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.480]   Twig 8.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.760]   Because of August.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.760]   Twig 8, and you get 10% off for six months.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.320]   At squarespace.com, use the offer code Twig 8.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.520]   And we thank Squarespace for their support
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.760]   of this week in Google.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.560]   So Google's been on a spending spree.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:18.440]   They went and bought themselves, what, 1,030 patents from IBM?
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.160]   IBM?
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.080]   By the way, if you haven't listened to it,
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:26.360]   this week's-- or the latest online podcast
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.400]   from This American Life--
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.160]   Oh, yeah, that's fantastic.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.080]   --called when patents attack, everybody listen to it.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.440]   It's just amazing.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.000]   And it puts Nathan Mirable in his right spot.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.280]   But it also shows mainly the insanity
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.480]   of this, of the billions of dollars
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.440]   that are spent on patents not to increase invention,
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.960]   not to increase production, but only to defend one's self.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.520]   And this is exactly what Google did.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.280]   It bought itself some hardened underwear.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.000]   Yeah, because their patent poor is the way they're determined.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.960]   And I think they have taken the attitude
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.640]   that we don't really need patents.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.000]   We feel like we can be open and we want to share.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And we'll patent what we really need to.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.880]   But it turns out, it doesn't matter
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.520]   whether you feel you need patents or not.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.320]   You need them because it's the only way to defend yourself.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.840]   Gina, have you ever gotten a patent?
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.800]   No, no, I haven't.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.760]   Talk to me about your attitude about that.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.320]   In terms of if you invent something,
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.840]   why would you consider it?
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.760]   Why wouldn't you-- what would your--
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.880]   because I know you have invented things that probably
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.480]   you just don't think that way.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.360]   I don't think that way.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.600]   And I'm just so disgusted with the whole patent system
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.680]   that I just would hate to do it.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.960]   And honestly, all of my projects have been either side
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.720]   personal projects that weren't a huge business
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.600]   or I've been working for someone else who took care
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.640]   of that kind of thing.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.840]   So it really hasn't come up for me seriously.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.760]   But I am completely disgusted with the whole system.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.560]   And I'm kind of a little small part of me
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.400]   hopes that Google is going to try to change the system.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.360]   Because the next story in our roundup
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:03.560]   is about how Google is hiring an IP expert from the FTC.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.080]   Suzanne Michelle.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.120]   Yeah, who wrote a paper about how bad the patent system is
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.400]   and ways to improve it.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.520]   So that was an interesting hire.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.600]   So I wonder if they're just bulking up their patents
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.840]   and then maybe they're trying to acquire enough to then
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.600]   change the way that they try to make a change or make
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.520]   proposals about how the patent system is
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.240]   and some improvements.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.840]   But they need that leverage, right?
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.320]   They need to own a bunch of patents in order
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.160]   to make a move or try to change the way it works.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.280]   I don't know how they would do it.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.680]   I hope that they do.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.440]   Yeah, that's not very articulate about it.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.520]   I think Eric Schmidt's job right now
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.040]   is to do this kind of stuff, to lobby for this kind of stuff
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.160]   in Washington, among many other things, obviously.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.840]   So I know that they have that effort beginning.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.680]   But buying up the patents and then getting
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.320]   an intellectual property expert, like Suzanne Michelle,
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.000]   to be-- she was one of the FTC's top intellectual property
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.440]   officials, leaving her post to go work at Google,
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.680]   implies that they may be going after it from the other end.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.920]   A thousand patents at once.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.160]   That's huge.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.840]   There's also another patent pile.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.920]   I can't remember who it's from that Samsung, Apple,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.480]   and Google are all bidding on.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.520]   So Google has finally changed their minds.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.040]   Oh, it's Nortail.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.600]   Thank you.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.360]   I think they had the same attitude you did, Gina, which was,
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.880]   I don't really want to play this game.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.560]   I don't need to play this game.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.560]   And they've gotten big enough.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.480]   They've realized, well, now, every Oracle's coming after us.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.080]   All of the Android phones are now under all of these patent
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.920]   lawsuits from various areas.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.080]   We need to get in there.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.680]   Now, the way they would normally get in there--
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.560]   and this is what was described in this "America
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.120]   Life" episode so well--
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.520]   is to go and fight fire with fire.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.680]   You threaten to sue somebody to keep them from suing you,
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.960]   or if they do sue you, you file countersuit
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.880]   so that you can force a settlement.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.520]   But, Gina, I feel like what you're saying
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.880]   is you're hoping that they would do something different,
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.000]   where they would actually try to change the system.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.320]   Could they change it from within that way?
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.240]   Could they use a huge pile of patents
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   to just stop lawsuits in general somehow?
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.040]   I don't know.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:07.920]   Maybe they could.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.280]   I would like to see them try.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.040]   I mean, what are some other big things
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:12.920]   that Google's tried to change?
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.920]   They tried to change a little bit the way the mobile industry
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.120]   works and the way that mobile phones are sold
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.960]   to consumers and contracts and all those things.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:19.960]   That didn't go so well.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.280]   So I don't know.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.160]   I don't know if this hire is interesting.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.920]   It's interesting that her responsibilities are not clear.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.200]   She's been in the FTC for 11 years.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.040]   Very interesting.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.520]   So I would like to see them try to change.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.960]   Because I really think that at this point,
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.440]   patents do not protect innovation.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.520]   They stifle it.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.520]   And we have companies spending so much money on lawyers.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.360]   Lawyers make tons of money.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.040]   And companies have to put resources toward,
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.080]   instead of innovating and building new things,
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.920]   fighting these stupid battles.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.920]   So I would love to see Google take on the patent situation,
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.680]   because I really think it's in a bad place.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.200]   It just does not serve the technology industry well at all.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.080]   Do you feel like there should be patents, either one of you?
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.480]   Leo has gone on record recently as this week's Twitch,
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.280]   saying he doesn't think there should be software patents at all.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.480]   Gina, you first.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.480]   Hmm.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:19.480]   I tend toward saying no.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.960]   Not the way that they are now.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.560]   And honestly, I haven't thought this through fully.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.960]   So I'm afraid I'm going to say something sounding really
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.640]   dumb, but I really think that most great ideas are just--
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.800]   we're all kind of standing on the shoulders of giants.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.520]   So we all going to build upon things
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.320]   that other people have done, every single kind of technology.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.960]   And I just-- I don't think that it serves anyone well to say,
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.360]   this is mine.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.000]   No one else can do anything with it.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.480]   I mean, I know there has to be some sort of protection in place,
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.720]   just not what we have now.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.960]   There's a lot of room for improvement.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.320]   I keep on going back and forth, Tom, on this.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:58.080]   I think that-- because I've had the same battle with myself
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.440]   about other IP, about copyright as well.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.680]   I guess the question on patents is that the whole raison
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:11.720]   debt for patents is that it was posed to, as Gina just said,
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:16.560]   encourage innovation by having people be more open than not,
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.200]   because it gave them a path to openness that protected
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.760]   what they did, right?
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.680]   Well, it's clearly not working that way, right?
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.040]   It's stifling innovation.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.120]   It's making people scared.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.640]   It's stopping things.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.240]   So the rationale behind patents is not being served by patents.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.600]   Now, part of that is the absolute inanity
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.480]   of the patent system.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.440]   If we had a decent patent system, would that be better?
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.320]   Was that a solution?
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:40.800]   I don't know.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.440]   But we all know the patent system now is insane.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.480]   On this American life show, they highlight the patent recently
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:54.200]   issued for toast, which is just an absurd mockery
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.400]   of the whole system using the system itself.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.600]   And some of the patents they talk about on the show
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.120]   are so broad as to cover absolutely everything.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.720]   And there are 1,000 patents just like that patent.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.040]   They can't even issue patents on top of patents,
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.640]   let alone on top of real prior art.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.800]   All right, so let's say the system worked.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.880]   Let's say that they actually got down to decent patents
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.520]   that really were real.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.320]   Would that improve innovation?
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:23.080]   I think in a world that moves as fast as ours does today,
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:27.080]   it wouldn't, because the patent system, no matter how fast
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.720]   it could be, will be way behind the innovation that's
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.960]   already occurring.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.720]   And when you see something neat, what do we all do?
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.560]   You learn from it.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.200]   You copy it.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.960]   You build on the shoulders of giants, as Gina said.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.640]   So I'm the same as Gina.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.360]   I'm afraid to say anything definitive,
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.520]   because I'm afraid of being stupid about it.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:49.280]   But I am seeing that this needs a very different way to think.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.440]   Yeah, I guess I just won't be afraid to be stupid.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.400]   I don't think there doesn't need to be patents.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.800]   I think there is room for patent law.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.480]   But I think patents and I'll throw in copyrights in there
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.320]   as well need to be ripped up and started over
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.160]   with the aim of what you're saying, where they actually
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.640]   can be demonstrated to encourage innovation,
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.640]   then we should have the law.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.200]   Because like you said, the idea was,
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.160]   I want protection from my idea so that if I start putting it
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.680]   out there, I don't just get ripped off by somebody else,
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.680]   and it gets taken away from me.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:29.160]   In software, the reason I think a lot of people say we just
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.840]   shouldn't have patents is rarely do you
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.880]   see software patents protecting true innovation, something
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.000]   entirely new.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.920]   You see them protecting a little variation.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.600]   The algorithm is broken for determining what is patentable.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.360]   And that needs to be absolutely overhauled.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.200]   And I think in that process, maybe we
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.320]   can discover whether software actually is patentable or not.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.760]   I mean, I tend to favor the free software foundation
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.560]   perspective a little bit that I should
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.360]   be able to write whatever software I want,
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.440]   run whatever software I want on my devices.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.320]   And software should be open and free,
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.520]   because it's just the thing that's making the device work.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.640]   And the device is the thing that's patentable.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.680]   But maybe I am being afraid of being stupid a little bit.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.840]   I don't want to go so far as to say there would never
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:18.720]   be a case where software couldn't be patentable.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.120]   You know, I just wrote a piece for Wired Germany, which
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.160]   they nicely translated for me that I'm
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.800]   hoping to sell here in the US on Gutenberg
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.440]   as the first technology entrepreneur.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.920]   And I was fascinated doing the research for it.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.920]   I just loved it.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.600]   One thing I learned is it went when Gutenberg lost his
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.920]   business to his main investor, because he
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.920]   didn't have the cash flow to pay up.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.280]   Gutenberg had been incredibly, incredibly
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.800]   secretive before, very Steve Jobs-like.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.040]   He operated out of three or four facilities,
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.640]   so no one knew the whole picture of what was going on.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.880]   He wouldn't let people in.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.080]   He wouldn't let them in the business,
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.080]   just all kinds of things.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.760]   But then when he lost the business, he already did.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.240]   He open sourced it.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.840]   He taught other people how to do it,
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.480]   because it was his nah-nah to the guys who had stolen
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.240]   and was taking his business.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.960]   And what made more innovation happen?
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.040]   The closed printing press method or the open method?
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.040]   The answer is obvious.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.840]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.800]   I agree with what you're saying, Jeff.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:21.400]   I mean, I think that we have to have a path to openness
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.760]   and a path to innovation.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.360]   And this idea that we seem to have the presumption
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.680]   these days that everything should be locked down,
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.040]   either for a long time in the case of copyright,
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.400]   or in breadth in the case of patent,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.480]   that every little thing you could possibly come up with
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.200]   should be locked down.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.720]   Let's talk about Google Plus.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.080]   Good news for Google Plus.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.800]   Hitting 25 million visitors.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.880]   And apparently, pretty sticky as well,
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.560]   even while it's still invite only.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.680]   I mean, it's not impossible to get an invite.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.120]   It's fairly permeable.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.160]   But it's limited.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.920]   Not everybody can just sign up for it.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.800]   So that's a pretty big number.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.400]   And remember, it was introduced on my birthday, June 28th.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.800]   So not that long ago.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.360]   I've heard that.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.040]   Thank you.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.720]   Andrew Lipsman, vice president of industry analysis at ComScore,
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.840]   is the one estimating the 25 million unique visitors.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   And you guys, you talk about it every week.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.760]   Developers now think Google Plus can beat Facebook.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.080]   25 million viewers.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.280]   You got developers starting to talk good about it.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.400]   What does it need-- what needs to happen for that to work,
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.760]   though?
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.280]   Gina?
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.680]   Google Plus is on the right track.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.040]   It's doing really well.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:32.600]   People love it.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.680]   People are using it.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.040]   I think it's great that it's had this adoption, this vertical line
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:38.960]   of adoption.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.520]   I tell you the truth, I don't think
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.920]   that it's that big a deal given Google's suite of products
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.880]   and this sort of brand trust that people have in Google.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.960]   Of course, it took Twitter and Facebook much longer
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.360]   to gain users because people didn't know who they were.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.640]   They were unknown companies that
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.200]   had to build themselves up on the basis of this new product.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.200]   Google Search, I mean, I think is one of the most trusted brands,
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.800]   in at least the United States.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.680]   I think we've talked about.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.840]   People love Gmail.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.480]   And the fact that developers think
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.320]   that Google's going to beat Facebook, absolutely.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.560]   And we've talked about the trust factor a lot on this show.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.240]   I think that people--
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.720]   for my perspective, are people.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.760]   I should say, are people.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.680]   Our audience trust the Google brand more than Facebook.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.680]   So I think Google Plus is absolutely on the right track,
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.960]   still really enjoying the customer service,
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.480]   speaking of customer service that Googlers have been doing
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.600]   inside of Google Plus.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.120]   I see I'm following-- I've circled quite a few Googlers
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.680]   and they're constantly discussing the product.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.380]   I think that the one snag that they've got going on right now
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.120]   is this name issue, which they've been real quiet about.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.880]   And I'm really interested to hear what the outcome of this
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.440]   is going to be, the real name is policy I'm referring to.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.840]   I think that this real name is policy really contradicts
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.960]   the Don't Be Evil stance.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.600]   I think that they need to support pseudonyms and brand names
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.320]   and that kind of thing.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.600]   I'm hoping to see them announce a resolution to that.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.880]   Other than that, I think that that's
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.040]   a problem for a small percentage of people.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   Other than that, I think Google Plus is going to continue its rise.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.200]   I've been using it a lot.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.480]   And it's really been taking a lot of my social media attention.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.360]   I really enjoy it.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.520]   I'm guaranteed to get 100 comment
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.040]   thread on a Google Plus post, a public post,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.920]   almost every time.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.680]   The engagement level is extremely, extremely high.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.640]   And for the most part, there are little little snags here
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.200]   and there, the great product to use, really enjoying it.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.240]   I'm feeling very bullish about it myself as a developer.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.720]   I can't wait for the API to get released.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.920]   I think that's key to right.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.160]   I actually found that I'm using it a little bit less.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.720]   My hashtag fund of a week ago was better done on Twitter
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.960]   because on Twitter, with hashtags, as I said last show,
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:40.320]   you can--
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.440]   Right, you can search.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.720]   You can gather around a topic.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.600]   And you can't gather around anything on Google Plus.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.680]   And I find that frustrating.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.120]   It's hard to get a sense of what people are talking about
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.320]   or join in on a conversation.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.280]   It bifurcates.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.080]   But these are things that I agree they'll fix.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.280]   I think search-- the irony to me is just so incredible.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   And I wish someone would explain why they came out
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.440]   with this product, this company, without search.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.400]   I know it's incredible.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.040]   But I was talking to some people--
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.640]   There's a Muslim field test, Jeff.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:11.600]   That's why.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.080]   I know, but Jesus.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.640]   They got the technology.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.000]   There's got to be a story behind that.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.520]   And I would die to know the story.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.640]   I was talking to some other people today
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.720]   from a Mozilla news project that's really quite neat
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.160]   that Google's involved in.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.960]   And somebody started talking about the word social in there.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.200]   It occurred to me, what the heck does social mean?
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.080]   I can define antisocial.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.160]   And social's kind of the whole rest of life.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.920]   Everything is social.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.880]   And I don't think that Google Plus is really
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.120]   about Google and social.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.600]   I go back to the notion that it's about them generating
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:51.680]   signals and having more connections with us as a person.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.120]   In a sense, it's not about Google, Korean, and social world
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:54.800]   for us.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.040]   It's about Google trying to get more human with us.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.960]   And that's what makes Google Plus to me so interesting
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:08.240]   is that it becomes this Petri dish for us people.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.080]   I find that Google Plus, for me, ends up
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.400]   being a place to ask a question and get an answer
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.080]   and start a conversation about your own topic, where Twitter
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.880]   is a place for me to throw out a thought
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.200]   and maybe get a little reaction.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.920]   But Google Plus works much better for, hey,
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.320]   I want to discuss this one thing.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.800]   Twitter works for, let me just throw something
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.040]   into the general stream of conversation.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.800]   So for instance, I used to use Twitter quite a bit
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.120]   for researching Top 5s for the show I do Top 5.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.880]   I'd say, hey, what's your favorite Harry Potter movie
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:43.400]   moment?
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.760]   And everyone would at reply me.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.160]   And then I'd have to go find those at replies
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.520]   and page through them.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.960]   Google Plus works much better for that,
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.520]   because you get everything in one thread.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.360]   But like you say, it doesn't allow you to bust out of that.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.920]   So if you want to have a more wide ranging conversation,
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.120]   Twitter is better for that.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.120]   But it's entirely replaced Facebook for me.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.880]   I don't touch Facebook anymore.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:02.800]   Really?
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.920]   And to be fair, I didn't touch Facebook that much
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.240]   to begin with.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:13.960]   But I find the few uses that I had for Facebook
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.280]   have been limited now to getting in touch
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:21.680]   with close friends and relatives for very particular purposes,
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.880]   which I probably, if they were all on Google Plus,
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.880]   could do on Google Plus.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.160]   They're just not all over there yet.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.240]   Well, I think Gina just raised a metric for success here
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:34.280]   is the robustness of the conversation that's caused.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.840]   And Facebook is the lower end, the lowest end of that.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.200]   Twitter is up but disjointed.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.040]   And Google Plus is actually very high.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.480]   It's engineered very well to do that,
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.240]   to the point of a fault, because you have to mute
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.160]   Scoble all the time as he decides Google Plus is the next thing
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.840]   in debt, next thing in debt, next thing in debt.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.800]   You have to-- you have to--
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:59.680]   Scoble himself admits you just got to mute me a lot in life.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.040]   But do you think that Facebook is low on that list?
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.680]   Because you're followed by or commented on on Google Plus
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.320]   by more of your audience?
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.360]   Like, I go to Facebook because my family and friends
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.360]   from high school who aren't nerds are there.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.200]   So the conversations I have there,
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.480]   they're all like, what's all this techno mumble jumble you
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.760]   or are we talking about?
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.960]   But I can have a conversation about something
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.280]   highly technical on Google Plus.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.240]   And that's our audience.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.960]   So the conversation is very high quality.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.760]   I mean, Facebook's features are very similar to Google Plus.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:32.000]   And it's threaded conversations, your likes, and images,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.600]   and links.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.440]   So do you think that that's because of the people who
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:39.360]   are on G Plus or because of the tool itself?
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.440]   I'm not at all sure.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.720]   I think that there's an interesting discussion here.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.600]   Fred Wilson and I got into a disagreement,
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.640]   which doesn't happen very often, on Twitter.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.000]   And he proposed that he and I should
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.160]   do a debate on this topic, on the notion of real identity.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:56.560]   And he is being rather dogmatic, I think.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.080]   And I respect Fred greatly, saying that real identity
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.880]   doesn't matter at all.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.680]   It doesn't help at all.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.280]   And my argument is, no.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.680]   He says that what made Facebook succeed
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:07.600]   was structured feeds and structured data.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.720]   Well, I don't agree because you could have structured
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.840]   the hell out of my space.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.760]   It was a bunch of fake people with no investment in it.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.760]   And it was all crap.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.120]   And it wouldn't have fixed that at all.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.480]   I argue that real identity, real people, real relationships,
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.520]   made Facebook work.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.320]   And it was the secret to it.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.960]   And of course, Twitter doesn't have real identity enforced,
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.400]   but there's a hell of a lot of real identity there.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.240]   People really use it because they want credit for what
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:32.760]   they're saying.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:35.200]   They want a lot of things.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.040]   Sorry I see I'm freezing again.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.520]   And so now we get to the question of Google+, and this,
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:47.200]   and the identity that happens there.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.000]   After our discussion last week, Gina,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.040]   I'm still in a middle ground where
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.640]   I understand the desire to have real identity because of what
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.040]   it does for the service alongside pseudonyms, alongside,
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:03.920]   perhaps, some structure of approved anonymity.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:09.600]   But I understand the desire to have a higher quality
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.640]   discussion around authenticity.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.920]   And so I think that that's part of the thing about Facebook,
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.280]   ironically, is that those are the people you really know.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:21.880]   And so you have an invested relationship with them
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:25.600]   versus on Twitter, I'll throw out a line.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.400]   Yeah, that's not disposable on Twitter, definitely.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.800]   All right, we got some Android news we need to get to.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.120]   But I want to thank our sponsor Netflix.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.520]   If you would like to watch some streaming movies for free,
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.160]   go to Netflix.com/twit right now.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.480]   And you can get 30 days of Netflix streaming for free.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.640]   Watch it on your phone.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.200]   Watch it on your tablet.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.280]   A ton of Android phones have it now.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.160]   It's going to come into more all the time.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.640]   And you can watch it on your television
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.080]   through a Roku player, through an Apple TV,
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.680]   through an Xbox 360, a PS3, a Wii, and see movies in HD
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.160]   right there on your screen.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.000]   No risk trial.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.640]   Netflix.com/twit.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.960]   We thank them for their support.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.640]   And if you're already tried Netflix
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.240]   or you're already using Netflix,
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.760]   tell others, spread it around, give it to your mom,
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.880]   give it to your kids.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.480]   Well, if your kids are out of the house,
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.200]   if the kids are in the house, you could just sign up for it.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.960]   Netflix.com/twit, and we thank them for their support
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.560]   of this week in Google.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:24.560]   So, Candelis, who does the worldwide numbers,
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.560]   came out with their most recent survey,
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.880]   doesn't really show much of a change in the market,
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:33.320]   but Google's mobile OS is now on 48%
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.600]   of smartphones worldwide, month to month.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.080]   That's not that much different,
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.960]   but it's a steady uptick that has Android
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.280]   headed to 50%.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:48.280]   And it looks like there's no stopping the rampant growth.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.240]   - Makes sense.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.280]   Tons of handsets out there and options.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.200]   Lots of Android devices out there.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.560]   It makes a lot of sense that this is activations
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.160]   or this is just cell phones, handsets.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.880]   - Just handsets, yeah, we're not talking about tablets.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.240]   And I believe we're talking about existing market share,
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.040]   not sales, if I'm right.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.400]   - Okay, gotcha, gotcha.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.760]   Yeah, makes a lot of sense.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.160]   Android's doing really well.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.600]   Also, I hope that Google can study the course
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.320]   for Android a little bit on a few items.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.560]   Like, I'd like to see Google TV do a little better,
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:24.400]   although Google TV isn't included in this write up
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.680]   in tablets, but--
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.400]   - Did you see the news on Google TV?
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.840]   - Yeah, since our last show that they have more returns
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.200]   than sales.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.900]   - Now, they've clarified that.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.720]   - Oh, I don't--
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:38.040]   - They have more returns from retailers
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.960]   than they have had retailers sell.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.720]   They are not being returned by the consumers
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.720]   who actually buy them.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.680]   So they're just not selling any.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.280]   It's not that they're breaking.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.120]   (laughing)
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:48.960]   - Well, that's good news.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:51.440]   - And now they're trying to sell some for $99
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.920]   instead of $2.99, right?
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.920]   $2.49.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.040]   - And you can get the honeycomb beta on it,
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.920]   although you can't go back, so be careful.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.320]   But it's actually fairly easy.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.240]   If you find the honeycomb beta,
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.440]   there's lots of places to find it online.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.560]   And put it on a USB drive,
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:08.840]   you just turn your box off, plug in the USB drive,
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.600]   reboot, and it installs itself.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.360]   It's fairly, it's almost too simple
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.320]   because if it doesn't work, it could break your system.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.680]   There's always that chance, and you can't go back.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.720]   But you don't have to get root access to do it.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.160]   - And is the market, the market hasn't launched?
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.640]   Isn't it the honeycomb beta yet?
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.040]   - You know, that's a good question.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.720]   I would assume people would be talking that up
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.560]   if that was in there.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.040]   And I've been meaning to do this
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.440]   to my Logitech review unit and try it out.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.280]   I've been putting it off 'cause I wanna bring it in here
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:42.720]   and do it on camera and watch it fail spectacularly
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.000]   live on the stream, probably.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   But I mean, I still believe in Google TV
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.720]   as a possibility, but right now,
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.440]   it's just, we're just talking about Netflix.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.400]   It's my Netflix box in the bedroom
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.960]   because I happen to have it.
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.040]   And that's the other way to get it.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.480]   I've used it a couple times for HBO Go,
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.640]   which is one of the few ways you can get HBO Go
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.400]   on a television versus on a tablet or a phone.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.560]   - Wait, on Google TV, you have HBO Go?
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.040]   - Yeah, through Chrome.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.280]   - Oh, through Chrome, okay.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.320]   - And they actually have a shortcut widget on the screen
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.400]   that takes you to HBO Go,
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.600]   but it just takes you to a Chrome full-screen browser.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.280]   - Very cool, that's super cool.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.560]   I also believe in the possibility of Google TV.
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.080]   I've always kind of come to embarrass to admit
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.360]   how much I like the Google TV, the Logitech unit.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.560]   I got it as part of their developer program.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:36.200]   And I really like having a browser with Flash on my TV.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.400]   You know, I mean, there are a lot of places--
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.640]   - Even if everyone blocks it.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.480]   It's nice to know.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.800]   - Well, not quite everyone.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.400]   So I'm a UFC fan and I like to watch the fights
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.120]   on the website, the UFC website,
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.440]   because you can either just scrubber
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.960]   and you can replay things and whatever.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.880]   So I really enjoy that.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.040]   And I like picture in picture,
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.720]   I like being able to search Twitter.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.280]   The thing is, is that it's just,
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.360]   it's laid foul for so long, right?
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.800]   And they've been promising the market in an upgrade.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.920]   It's supposed to happen late this summer, right?
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.000]   So soon, maybe this month,
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.240]   but it's just been a really long time.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.080]   So it doesn't surprise me.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.400]   Yeah, the price was too high.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.440]   It didn't impress when it first got released
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.280]   and it's been a long time.
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:14.680]   So I'm really looking forward to the upgrade,
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.560]   which apparently will be this honeycomb upgrade
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:17.400]   that you're talking about.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.320]   It looks like I have an evening project.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.960]   - I'm looking forward to the marketplace.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.880]   - I think that was a good question to ask,
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.880]   because once this thing actually is able to run some apps,
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:29.000]   I think you'll be able to make better use of it.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:29.840]   - Definitely.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:30.880]   - And there've been some patches
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.200]   that have fixed some glitzy things for me,
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.880]   but overall, $99 is gonna convince you to get one, Jeff.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:41.920]   - It's not the money, it's the usability.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.920]   You know, I think that's what I wait for
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.560]   and see what happens.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.400]   - All right.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.440]   - That's reasonable.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.640]   I think that absolutely is reasonable.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.120]   Google and TI, Texas Instruments,
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.520]   are hooking up for ice cream sandwich,
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.960]   looking a little farther down the line.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:02.200]   Ice cream sandwich will allow developers to create apps once.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.000]   The operating system is due in the fourth border
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.120]   will be smart enough to figure out
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.160]   which type of device the app is running on
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.280]   and then adjust accordingly.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.800]   TI will be a prominent part of the ice cream sandwich rollout.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.120]   What does this mean?
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.000]   - Got me.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.160]   - This means, from what I understand,
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.440]   I have published an Android app
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.040]   and I haven't done a whole lot of tablet development,
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.640]   but it basically means that Honeycomb
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:28.240]   and the core Android will merge.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.920]   So as a developer, you can make an app
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:34.040]   which is smart about what is available to it,
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.240]   whether or not it's a tablet,
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.720]   whether or not it has tablet support
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.360]   of those different panels and that the smart bar
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.520]   and the different things that ice cream sandwich
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.880]   or the tablet part of ice cream sandwich makes available,
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.320]   which is really nice for developers
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.720]   because you can build your app to sort of degrade
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.760]   or upgrade gracefully depending on
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.480]   what kind of device the person is using,
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.320]   whether or not it's a tablet or a phone.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.360]   And Android has a lot of that right now.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.160]   When you publish your app, you can say,
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.200]   here are the assets to use if you have a low-res screen,
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.440]   here are the high-res assets to use on a bigger screen.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.280]   Some devices have hardware keyboards and some don't,
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.760]   so this just kind of continues down that path
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.560]   of letting apps take advantage
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.000]   of what's available to them on install.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.400]   So that allows TI to take the architecture
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.760]   they've been building for phones
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.680]   and be able to execute the tablet operating system
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.720]   and put their chips in tablets
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.400]   is what it seems like because of that.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.480]   London-based research firm called Vision Mobile
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.680]   released a method of tracking openness
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.240]   among mobile platforms called the Open Governance Index.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.440]   And according to its metrics,
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:39.520]   Android is the least open of all the supposedly
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.840]   open source mobile platforms,
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.440]   seeing this on ReadWriteWeb,
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.760]   23% openness rating,
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:47.360]   Eclipse, which is an open development platform
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.160]   comprised of extensible networks and tools,
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.200]   got the highest rating at 84%.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.840]   I think, you know, a lot of people have considered this
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:58.520]   to be true already, just based on the issues
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:01.540]   they've had around rollouts and access to the code.
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:05.160]   So they're comparing the Android to things like
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:08.520]   Linux, WebKit, Mozilla, MIGO, Symbian.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.160]   How much do you feel like this impacts you, Gina?
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.920]   You know, this word open, it's just so fraught.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:17.640]   I mean, it's the word that Google uses to sell Android.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.440]   And it's also the word that the free software community
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.440]   uses to indict Android, you know,
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.160]   is not a real open source product.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.720]   And it makes me kind of crazy, I have to tell you.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.760]   I would like to see these numbers cross-reference
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.640]   with usage because I think that Android's usage
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.960]   is probably much higher than a lot of these other products.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.200]   Let's just say I love Eclipse.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:39.840]   It is the IDE that I live in and develop in every single day.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.840]   It's a great, great platform for developers.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:45.160]   The thing about openness, I mean,
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.120]   you can define it in so many different ways.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.400]   As a user for me, Android being open means
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.400]   I can install whatever I want on my phone.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.400]   All I can, you know, I don't even have to go through the market.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.400]   Someone can publish an APK and I can say
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.240]   install from untrusted sources and I can install
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.840]   anything I want on my phone.
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.600]   And the pure versions of Android,
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.960]   which don't ship on all devices,
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.120]   but the pure version of Android lets me tether
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.880]   and it lets me fiddle with settings
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:11.400]   that I normally wouldn't be able to change in other situations.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.600]   So I know that's a very loose user-centric view
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.200]   of what Open is, but I think that, you know,
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.120]   in the end, it's users that really matter.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.200]   So, you know, these debates about whether or not
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.200]   Android is truly open source and, oh, you know,
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.640]   what, look at this, what is this open Google?
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:29.520]   It feels tiring to me because Open is a marketing term
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.040]   for Google when it comes to Android.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.800]   And I mean, it is an open source project,
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:36.920]   but there are decisions that they've made
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:39.160]   that make it maybe less pure open
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.360]   than some people, you know, kind of define.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.200]   - Isn't that the problem?
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.720]   It's the expectation that's been built around it
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:46.720]   that it's going to be open
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.360]   and it doesn't meet that definition for a lot of people.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.760]   - All right, I think that's really what it is, right?
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.960]   I mean, Google touts the operating system is open
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.360]   and that's its differentiator.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.800]   And then I think when Android doesn't do exactly
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.760]   what people want it to do or it's blocked
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.440]   or something's limited, it's like, you know, well, right,
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.440]   you haven't fulfilled your promise.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.040]   - So maybe what they should do is tout it as closed
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.720]   and then people will praise it,
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.800]   look how open this closed operating system is.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.120]   - Look at how open this closed operating system is.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.080]   Yeah, I just noticed actually that WebKit is in this list
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.560]   and WebKit is obviously very heavily used in Chrome and Safari
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.160]   but packaged up in the Chrome and Safari.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.080]   So.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.360]   - All right, we're going to wrap up here in just a few minutes,
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.480]   but before we do want to thank NewTech
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.600]   who provide the Tri-Caster 850,
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.120]   we're using to switch the show right now.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.320]   It's like having a giant TV truck,
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.160]   but it's the size of a bread box.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.560]   Nobody knows how big a bread box is,
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.480]   but it's the size of a desktop PC.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.120]   It's actually a little smaller than the many desktop PCs.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.000]   24 channel system with everything you need
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.920]   to make a TV show, including amazing virtual sets.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.520]   We can use Tri-Caster for desktop or portable production.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.400]   We could take one with us out in the field
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.040]   when we go to CES every year.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.880]   That's how we do it.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.400]   We get a Tri-Caster out there
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.240]   and we've got the ability to do all the switching
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.160]   we do right here in the new studio out on the road with us.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.360]   Let's you live stream, project and record HD video
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.760]   all at the same time.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.440]   If you'd like to find out more about Tri-Caster,
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.160]   head over to the website, newtech.com.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.200]   It's n-e-w-t-e-k.com.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.200]   And big thanks to NewTech for the Tri-Caster.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.920]   I know all of the folks running the board here at Twit
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.160]   are incredibly relieved to have all those extra channels,
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.080]   those 24 channels in there,
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.840]   makes things quite a bit easier.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.880]   Let's finish off.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.400]   Googled, apparently, still does a browser.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:41.400]   And I just got really frustrated with Chrome yesterday.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.960]   And I've been having the little frowny folder face way too often.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.600]   Oh, snap.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.760]   And I was like, that's it.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.720]   Firefox has had a couple revs since I was living in it daily.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.480]   I'm going back.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.880]   Last night, switched over to Firefox,
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.800]   was using it all morning this morning
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.400]   and it just doesn't have the snappy UI.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.320]   For me, it doesn't have,
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.480]   I want to be able to close a tab without clicking on it.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.000]   I want to be able to move tabs back and forth faster
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.600]   than Firefox can do.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.600]   And it just isn't, I really wanted to switch back to Firefox
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.400]   and I couldn't.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.600]   That doesn't bode well.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.320]   I mean, speed, right?
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.680]   Speed is, and still is, Chrome's huge selling point.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.160]   It is quite snappy, although, are you running the beta,
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.160]   but the vanilla release, the stable version.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.160]   Yeah, the stable version.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.960]   And you're still getting crashed at crash tabs.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.360]   Yeah, I was getting tab crashes.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.560]   Now, I haven't had one today.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.640]   OK, but since you switched back to Firefox.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.160]   You know, Tom, when I think crash, is it for me?
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.280]   Plus.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.160]   Does it?
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.800]   See, I was suspecting that's funny.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.240]   You say that.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.760]   I was suspecting Google Docs.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:46.160]   I don't know that.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.960]   That seems to be whenever Plus starts to try to do too much.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.520]   And it wants to do a huge update
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.920]   because it's trying to constantly update.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.320]   Then what happened, it starts to drag down
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.880]   my entire Chrome instances.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.000]   And then I'll snap something a few minutes later.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.440]   I don't know if that's a pattern or not.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.640]   I was seeing it with Google Docs tabs.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.600]   OK, so maybe there's some Google scripting.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.680]   Wouldn't surprise me.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.000]   You know, the story on the list that Judy mentioned,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.320]   speed, the Google Chrome gets instant pages.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.080]   Yeah, I was saying 13 just went stable, right?
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.040]   So the instant pages just got built in.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.880]   I got a question about that.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:28.240]   What does that do likely to the analytics of the site
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.400]   that receives it?
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.080]   Are advertisers going to have a fit?
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:35.160]   Does a page preload that you may never look at,
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.640]   but still gets counted as a page view and a unique user
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:41.640]   and an ad display?
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.840]   From what I understand-- and I'm not
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.040]   sure how they're doing it.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.640]   What do I understand, though?
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.000]   Analytics code does not trigger unless the tab comes
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.480]   to the front.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.760]   So it does not mess with views.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.520]   From what I understand.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.200]   And I'm not positive how exactly they're doing that.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.280]   But they are taking into account whether or not
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.280]   you actually look at the page.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:00.840]   Got it.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.600]   OK, good.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.960]   So this is just a thing that's going
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.840]   to make it big pages show up faster.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.240]   Yeah, they prefetch.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:10.720]   Pre-refetch.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.640]   Yeah, not only they prefetch all the CSS and JavaScript
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.240]   and HTML, but they actually render it.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.200]   So the JavaScript executes, the CSS lines up the images,
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.840]   all that stuff happens in the background.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.560]   So when you snap to that tab, the entire page is rendered.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.240]   Firefox has prefetching, which just grabs the files
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.400]   over the wire.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.440]   But this is pre-rendering.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.120]   So it's kind of the next step.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.320]   Now, did you all talk about the page speed service last week?
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.400]   We didn't.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.200]   That actually got announced, I think, right after our episode.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.600]   OK, because I tried it out.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.400]   Page speed is actually kind of in the same channel
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.640]   as this-- it's trying to make pages faster.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:52.360]   But page speed actually wants to make it faster on the site
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.120]   serving end.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.000]   So you point your DNS at a Google address,
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.480]   and it will speed up the loading of your website.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.320]   I tried it out with TomMaret.com,
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.040]   and it definitely speeded it up, not much, a second.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.400]   But you know, something that could make a difference
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.000]   when you're surfing.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.320]   But the weird thing is the start rendering time slowed down.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.360]   So when you looked at it, it looked
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.200]   like my old site was loading faster,
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.600]   because you got things up faster,
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.120]   even though the actual loading of the entire code
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.640]   was faster with the page speed tool.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.680]   Had the DNS maybe not propagate?
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.880]   Was the DNS request having to refresh it?
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.200]   Well, I should have mentioned that.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.240]   I didn't do the entire sign up.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.000]   I compared the load times at the web page test
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:40.960]   that they provide you.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:45.600]   So I may get a different experience when I actually
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.840]   tried it for real.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.880]   Right, right.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.840]   This is blowing my mind.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.920]   Basically, Google is hosting the entire internet.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.080]   I mean, that's what they're offering to do.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.320]   They're actually hosting your site,
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.360]   or they're just caching--
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.760]   I mean, are they caching scripts?
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.160]   If you have dynamic scripts on your site,
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.600]   like the other PHP script on your site,
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.160]   are they--
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.600]   How's the actual one?
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.240]   Grabbing the output or using their cache copy?
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:12.640]   They're reinterpreting the code to optimize it.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.240]   So what their promise is, they're saying, look,
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.800]   you don't have to write good coding more.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.080]   You can be sloppy as I'll get out.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:24.760]   We'll optimize it and fix any errors and then re-serve it.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.680]   And so we only need to look at it once,
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:30.320]   and then we'll have it ready to give to folks.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.560]   In fact, let me see if this--
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.560]   I think my test is still cached.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.240]   I'm going to see if that-- now the video is-- oh, yeah,
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.120]   there it is.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:40.960]   All right, yeah, here.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960]   Let me start it over again.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.640]   So check this out.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:47.200]   On the left is my original site, and the right is the optimized.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.960]   And when you start going, oh, now I
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:54.080]   got to reload the page, don't I?
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.160]   See, because this is what I get for trying
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.840]   to do a demo on the fly from a six-day old blink.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.320]   All right, so original on the left,
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.320]   optimized on the right.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.760]   Now watch.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.680]   It takes a couple of seconds, and then it
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.520]   looks like the left is faster.
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:11.080]   Interesting.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:11.760]   It does.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.120]   But it was--
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:12.480]   But it was--
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.000]   But it was--
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:13.520]   --that image came up.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.840]   Yeah, yeah, because that top image in the first post
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.200]   come up faster.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.840]   And that's because the start render time is slower.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.000]   Now, if you notice, they used to give me that start render time.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.280]   And in this cached version of the test, it doesn't show that.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.920]   But then you can also see the page load time difference.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.960]   The first time was negative one second.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.880]   So it saved me 1.3 seconds.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.840]   Repeat view page load time.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.520]   You think would be faster, but it's actually not that much faster.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.800]   Because of the caching that is already
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.680]   done on the browser site, I suppose.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.080]   Mm-hmm, mhm.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.440]   Interesting.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.640]   But yeah, you can go to--
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   let's see if I can get back to the--
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:57.320]   You have to submit your name and your site to a form.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.240]   You go to webpagetest.org.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.640]   And you just type in your location
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.480]   so that you're getting a fair test.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.560]   You want to get somewhere that's close to you.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:12.840]   And then what browser you want it to test as, put in your URL,
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.560]   start the test.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.400]   Cool.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.000]   Very cool.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.240]   But getting back to the Google is going
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.680]   to be running the internet.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:28.120]   Is that a good idea for people to start relying on Google
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:32.800]   for all of this stuff, for their ads, for their email,
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.000]   for their docs, and now for actually--
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.160]   Coming to the late children.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.320]   Coming to the late.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.080]   It's a little scary.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.440]   It makes me a little antsy, I'll be honest.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.600]   I like hosting my website.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.520]   Well, you still host it.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.720]   That's the brilliance of it.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.640]   You're still hosting it.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.280]   You still host it.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.760]   They're just optimizing it.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.040]   Right.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.840]   They're just optimizing it for me.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.880]   They're just-- what's the difference between this
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.520]   and Akamai serving large media sites?
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.080]   There you go.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.320]   It's actually not that much.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.440]   It's kind of CDN-like.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.720]   It's like a CDN, yeah.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.680]   All right.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.000]   We're running short on time.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.760]   You guys got favorites you want to pick out of what's left here?
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.320]   I just saw some news just up.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.440]   It was news to me that Randy Zuckerberg has quit Facebook.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.000]   Is that news?
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:18.840]   It used to be too.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.040]   Randy Zuckerberg.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.640]   That's Mark's sister, right?
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.960]   Mark's sister, yeah.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.360]   And starting her own company that's
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.320]   going to advise media companies how to be more social.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.640]   Now I've just lost the link.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.960]   So when you say she's quitting Facebook,
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.280]   she didn't delete her account.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.680]   She left the company.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.640]   She left the company.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.920]   Make that clear.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.120]   Randy Zuckerberg is starting her own company.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.000]   She's very interested.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:40.920]   She's very interested.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.120]   I guess.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.080]   Randy, who, by the way, is on Leave Still, I think,
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.720]   because she has a beautiful baby.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.560]   And who she has pictures of on--
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.800]   so she started R2Z Media focusing on helping companies
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.720]   become more social.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.280]   My goal is to launch my own innovative programming
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.640]   and work with media companies to develop their programming
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.720]   in new and more social ways.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.880]   She said in her resignation letter, according to Mashable.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.480]   And she was the director of marketing.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.240]   I just read an interview with her earlier this week,
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.360]   where she was defending the real name's policy of Facebook.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.280]   But of course, good news.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.280]   Major, she said that she thought anonymity had to go away.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.520]   Yeah, she's like, forget anonymity.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.160]   It's over.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.120]   I think that's--
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.400]   It's a little strong.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.360]   I understand the impulse to say, you know,
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.480]   what people behave better when there's less anonymity.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.240]   Using your real name is a good idea.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.040]   In many of the forums that I've been in charge of,
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.040]   at different websites, we've said, look, you know what?
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.080]   You've got to have a real account with a real name.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.000]   It really cuts down on the clutter.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.560]   But there's that other side of it.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.880]   There's that dissident whistleblower side of it
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:46.240]   that you eliminate if you require real names.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.160]   Right.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:47.960]   Yep.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.440]   I think this makes a lot of sense for her.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.800]   I mean, you know, anyone would love
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:54.120]   to work with her knowing that ties that she has to Facebook.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.920]   And clearly, she's--
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.160]   She's a sweetheart.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:00.400]   She's really everybody's nicest everybody seems.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.840]   And every time I've dealt with her,
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.400]   she's just absolutely a dandy to be with.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.520]   Yeah, and good for her for starting her own thing.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.480]   I'm surprised she didn't do it sooner, honestly.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.600]   I can't imagine working with your brother for that many years.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.440]   And it's such a huge explosive, you know, company.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.040]   And to have that kind of knowledge,
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.040]   that kind of first-hand knowledge,
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.720]   and not want to do your own thing.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.560]   All right.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.320]   We got another one of these stories
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.480]   about a school banning teachers from using a social network.
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.400]   In this case, it's Facebook in Missouri.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.600]   It's not just a school.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.640]   It's the entire state.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:32.560]   It's the entire state.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.400]   It's a state of Missouri.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.400]   I didn't realize that.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.440]   It's passing a law.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.400]   And there's some finer points to it.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:41.040]   But basically, it is all but bans teachers
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.120]   from friending students on social networks.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:43.880]   At what levels?
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.760]   Just elementary and high school level?
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.200]   OK.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:50.080]   And on the one hand, I kind of understand that
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.200]   because it sounds creepy.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.280]   My own rule, I teach graduate school,
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.960]   is I won't initiate a friend.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.480]   And if a student of mine wants to friend me,
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.880]   they'll all do that.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.400]   You know, we're all adults here.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.120]   But in this case, it's what Dana Boyd often says,
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.800]   that it extends this stranger danger idea
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.320]   to be extreme to make all adults are bad for young people.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.880]   And that's going too far here.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.440]   You know, I look at it as the school dance.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.800]   And if some teachers are on Facebook,
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.160]   I actually like that because it's more eyes on the kids.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.720]   It's like chaperones.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.120]   And now the state has said, no, you adults are all evil
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.400]   and bad to kids.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.480]   Well, if we think adults are bad with kids on Facebook,
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.800]   then why are they teaching them in school?
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.400]   Good point.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.760]   Just had to get that out.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:46.640]   I mean, it does smack a little bit of fearing the new versus--
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.200]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:47.680]   Absolutely.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.120]   --you know, just because--
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.160]   do we have a law that bans teachers
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.560]   from calling children on a telephone, or stopping
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:57.400]   by their house?
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.440]   Those sound very creepy in certain circumstances.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.200]   But we don't need a law against that.
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:02.920]   Right.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.400]   This should be something that should be determined
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.040]   within the community, a cultural thing,
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:06.760]   within a difference.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.680]   Each school, you know, should kind of come up
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.280]   with their own guidelines, recommendations
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.200]   about this kind of thing.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.640]   And, you know, teachers and staff of schools
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.800]   deal with this all the time.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:20.080]   My wife works with undergraduate students
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.200]   and has to deal with this question of whether or not
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   she's a friend, she has two accounts,
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.800]   professional account, personal account.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.400]   But, you know, making a laws is insane.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.560]   All right, well, let's finish up with the tools and the tips
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.200]   and the numbers.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.240]   And we'll start off with you, Gina.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.200]   You've got a good way to avoid Airbnb disasters.
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.320]   Google launched a new experiment called Hotel Finder.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.800]   It's at google.com/hotelfinder.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.880]   And, you know, you put in a location and dates
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.680]   that you want to stay someplace.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:57.640]   And Hotel Finder returns hotel recommendations.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.400]   And so this sounds really similar to most, you know,
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.560]   travel kind of search sites.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.200]   But it's got a couple of neat features.
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.880]   The first thing it does-- like, I just did a search
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:06.960]   for Brooklyn, New York.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.200]   First thing it does is it goes to the area and it creates
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.840]   a shape around the most touristy areas
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.400]   where you're going to get the best hotel deals.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.640]   So I search for Brooklyn, but it gave me a good part of Loham
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.120]   and Hatton, which makes sense.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.760]   So it gives you list hotels by price and rating.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:25.000]   And you can scan the list and create what they call a shortlist
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.240]   of hotels that you're interested in possibly booking.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.040]   So it's a cool little tool.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.960]   For next time you take a trip to check it out,
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.520]   you need a place to stay.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.120]   You can-- if you click on that Edit Shape button
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:39.040]   in the right under the map after you search for a place,
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.080]   it's got this neat heat map of places
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.400]   where tourists typically visit.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.560]   So that's just cool from a data visualization.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.720]   Oh, yeah, that is cool.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.800]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.840]   They all end up in the touristy spots.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.360]   Yeah, they all end up in Midtown.
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.280]   And you can edit the shape.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.040]   You can increase the bounds or decrease them
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.760]   to narrow down the area where you want to stay.
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.640]   They all walk slowly and look up.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.640]   They're all fresh.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.080]   Let me give you a tip, rest of the world.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.240]   In New York, we have things to do.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.360]   We have places to go.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.240]   Five of you abreast like you can do in Kansas.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.120]   Doesn't work here.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:15.640]   I love you.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:16.360]   I love Kansas.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.400]   I love the flower estate.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.800]   But let us pass you.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.160]   And staring up at the skyscrapers gives you away.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:23.600]   Yes, exactly.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.960]   We will pick your pockets.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.840]   I think Gina, the shorts and the white socks
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.680]   with the sneakers with the backpack and the water bottle
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.000]   and the camera.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.880]   Yeah, that does it too.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.680]   Yeah, but their taxes are sure handy, aren't they?
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.120]   Indeed.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.040]   All right, I assume your number is not five abreast.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.600]   What is your number to this week?
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.480]   Oh, my number is 8%, which is the number
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:53.560]   of Newt Gingrich's followers that are according to Gawker,
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.280]   actually humans.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.280]   Wow.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:02.400]   2% of his 1.3 million followers are fake in one way or another.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.000]   Now, how that happens exactly?
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.400]   I'm not sure.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   But I found that number one.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.200]   But it should be even more than that
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.520]   is peak you, according to Gawker,
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.440]   then did an analysis of the other GOP contenders.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:18.520]   And it says that only 20% of Sarah Palin's are real.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.200]   Mitt Romney's 26% Michelle Bachman's 28%,
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:26.960]   if you consider her real, and Tim Polendy, 32%.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:31.040]   Is there an easy way for me to find this of my own?
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.280]   I believe yours are fake.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.880]   But that's a good point.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.280]   There isn't really an easy way.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.040]   But actually, I'm surprised somebody hasn't made a tool
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.080]   to easily go through.
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.880]   The problem is paging through a million or even 100,000
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.920]   followers is kind of hard.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.440]   And then you have the defined criteria.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.280]   What's fake?
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.040]   Someone who's never tweeted, someone
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.160]   who hasn't said a profile picture, that kind of thing.
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.280]   Someone who's still an egg.
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.640]   But yeah, interesting.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.040]   My dogs.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.840]   My dogs aren't fake, but they're Twitter accounts.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.720]   Kind of hard.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.760]   All right, I've got a couple of--
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.520]   I've got an alternate pick just in case,
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.960]   because I'm never sure what tools Leo may have or may have
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:11.560]   not done.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:14.240]   Has he done Reader before?
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.960]   R-E-D-E-R-The-App.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.380]   I've had app.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.160]   No, I don't believe he has.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.320]   I love that app, though.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:19.840]   All right.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.880]   That's what I'm going to do.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.840]   Reader, R-E-E--
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:26.160]   so misspelled, R-E-E-D-E-R--
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.160]   plugs into your Google Reader and gives you
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:33.120]   what I consider the best interface for Google Reader
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.360]   among any of the interfaces, including the one you actually
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.120]   get on the internet.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.680]   I use it every morning to just easily start reading my feeds,
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.960]   allows you to star things.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.280]   You can post things to delicious.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.160]   Put them on Twitter.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.040]   Email them to people.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.600]   You can look at your starred--
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.400]   it gives you the three views-- your unread items,
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.920]   your starred items, your everything items.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.720]   And it's just a fantastically well-designed app
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.200]   that I rely on in my daily life.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.560]   So check it out.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.000]   R-E-E-D-E-R.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.760]   I think they only have iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.120]   They have a Mac app now.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.960]   So I'm hoping they come out with other apps for other platforms
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:17.920]   as well, because they've just done a really fantastic job
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.640]   of designing it.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.640]   But check it out.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.840]   R-E-E-D-E-R.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.240]   All right, well, an unexpected pleasure to be with you guys.
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.640]   It was great to have you.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.680]   Thanks, Tom.
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.880]   Haggum high, Laporte.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.240]   We'll be back.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.640]   I'll be gone next week.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:36.000]   But I can't imagine-- if I do a crime,
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.200]   I want Leo on my jury.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.480]   I think it'd be a nice guy.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.200]   Yeah, well, you don't be the benefit of the doubt.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.440]   Be 11 angry men and Leo cheering them up.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:46.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.640]   You won't get the 12 angry men scenario.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.800]   Hopefully Leo won't get put on an eight-week trial,
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.360]   and it'll just be me next week.
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.880]   Well, I think the thing that's really bugging him
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.560]   is he's seen people go up and get rejected
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.040]   for being past employees of a major media company
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.920]   and having ever talked to someone on the internet
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.200]   that you didn't know.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.040]   So he's sitting there going, like, can I just duck out?
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.040]   Can I answer these now?
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.040]   No.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.040]   Right.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:13.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.600]   Oh, that is so frustrating.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:17.040]   And also, Mr. have to always be doing or saying
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.040]   or screaming something.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.360]   I can't imagine what's like for him.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.200]   Exactly.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.560]   Sitting in the waiting room.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.680]   Well, thank you again.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:28.400]   Gina Trapani, of course, at smarterware.org.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.880]   Check it out.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:30.920]   Try the beta.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.800]   I have been for a while now.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:33.600]   I love it.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.440]   Oh, on ThinkUp.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.280]   Yeah, yeah, particularly.
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.520]   So happy to use ThinkUp.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.000]   Awesome.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:37.360]   I'm still using it.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.280]   Still loving it.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.040]   Right on.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.960]   And of course, Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.400]   Which book are you--
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.840]   Are you on these days?
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:48.680]   I am on public parts.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:52.840]   That I spent yesterday recording the audiobook.
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:53.640]   And I'll go back tomorrow.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.160]   And since you all know how fast I talk,
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.960]   you can imagine how tough that is for me to do a good autorecoring.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.640]   We need this to be longer.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:01.120]   We need more than one file.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.400]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.880]   Buzz, what the problem is, I just muff every once
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.680]   in every paragraph.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.920]   The poor editor is going to be driven nuts.
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.040]   But I'm getting through it.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.240]   And yes, people who are nice enough to ask, yes,
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.440]   it will be a lot of book in the book's out in September.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:18.320]   Thank you for asking.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:18.800]   Excellent.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:19.240]   Excellent.
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.160]   Thank you both.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.160]   And thanks to you all for watching and listening.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.480]   We will see you-- well, Leo.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:26.520]   We will see you next week, if all things go well.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.720]   That's it for this week in Google.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.480]   See you next time.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:32.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.820]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:39.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
