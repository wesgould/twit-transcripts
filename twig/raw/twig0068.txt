[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.840]   Let's not forget there is a cloud, a cloudy day today.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.240]   But the sun is about to shine because here she is Gina Trapani
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.440]   back from Washington, DC, where she fixed the government.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.040]   In one fell swoop.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.680]   In one--
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.680]   In one swelphoop.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.920]   Gina Bloggs at smarterware.org.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.200]   She also works for Fast Company, fastcompany.com/worksmart.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   And are you working on another book?
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.560]   I am not, but I am building ThinkUp for expert labs.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.280]   That's exciting.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.640]   That's really my full time thing.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.040]   She's writing in PHP these days.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.800]   Yes.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.880]   Forget English.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.080]   Code is poetry.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.200]   Code is art.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.240]   Also here, there he is, Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.240]   from his book line study.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.840]   I'm trying to make you believe I've read it any of them.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.160]   He buys them by the foot, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.360]   He's also the author of The Fine.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.280]   What would Google do?
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.720]   That's the book right there.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.520]   Look right behind them.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.960]   You can see it.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.520]   And also with us, we have a newbie.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.320]   Be kind from gizmodo.com.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.360]   Joel Johnson is here.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.240]   Hi, Joel.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.740]   Hi.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.240]   How's it going?
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.200]   What do you do for gizmodo?
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.240]   I am, at the moment, editor at large, which I think
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.120]   is just kind of like a blanket term for retirement, right?
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.160]   Yeah, out to pasture.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.320]   Yeah, it was taken.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.240]   No, I pretty much do feature stuff.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.560]   But I still vlog here and there.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.600]   And yeah, so it's kind of all over the place.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.240]   That's awesome.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.160]   Well, we're glad to have you.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.760]   Welcome to the show.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.720]   I wish I worked at Google, $1,000 bonus to every employee.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.520]   That's worth about $20 million.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.400]   And they all get a 10% raise.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.440]   Kind of a little harder to figure out how much that is.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.480]   But the guess is that could be worth what?
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.400]   $20 billion.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.920]   Well, I'm at 10% on a total cost basis of $20 billion.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.000]   It's about $1 billion worth of raises,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.720]   according to Business Insider, the Silicon Alley Insider.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.440]   That's nice.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.920]   Merry Christmas from Google.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.720]   Did it say please don't leave us in the memo?
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.240]   Please welcome to check.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.080]   You read the confidential internal only memo.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.800]   Well, he said this like Googlers only.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.360]   So I don't know how they got this memo.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.880]   But basically, it implies we want to make sure
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.680]   that you feel rewarded for your hard work.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.120]   And we want to attract the best people to Google
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.080]   that it should say.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.240]   I mean, you can continue on.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.280]   Please don't leave.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.480]   They are kind of-- what is interesting is they say,
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.320]   we did a little research.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.880]   We found out you valued cash more than stock options.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.040]   So in effect, they're taking money out of the options
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.280]   and shoveling it over to $1,000.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.920]   But I have to say, they've raised the bar for me.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.360]   Here at Twit now, I'm in trouble.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.520]   I was T-shirts.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.520]   T-shirts.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.760]   Let's give you all T-shirts.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.320]   Are we all going to get $1,000 on this podcast?
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.960]   All of you.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.320]   Everybody on this podcast gets a 10% raise.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.320]   That's a myth.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.160]   But that is-- it is a reflection.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.640]   You hit the nail on the head, didn't you, Gina?
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.280]   It is a reflection of the fact that there's
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.920]   a brain drain to Facebook.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.800]   Yeah, it is.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.480]   It felt really kind of feels like a stop the bleeding move.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.600]   Is $1,000 enough to keep you from going to Facebook?
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.400]   $1,000 is a nice--
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.680]   hey, thanks.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.360]   I mean, that's a nice little bonus.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.080]   It's not enough to keep you from going to Facebook.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.280]   Christmas party, huh?
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.960]   They're going to have a big Christmas party, right?
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   I hope.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960]   [LAUGHS]
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.880]   It depends on how much you're making, too,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.320]   because those senior engineers or those mid-level engineers
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.920]   that they're really afraid of losing,
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.920]   I don't know if $1,000 is really all that much to them.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.240]   But 10% could be pretty good.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.480]   10%, yeah, that's worth it.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.360]   And actually, the stories we're hearing
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.520]   is if you go to your boss at Google
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.200]   and say, I'm leaving for Facebook,
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.360]   they will throw lots of money at you if they like you.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.800]   They want to keep you if possible.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.280]   Obviously, it's not been enough money for a number
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.000]   of senior engineers, but nevertheless.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.200]   Google told TechCrunch that this is--
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.720]   MG Seagly ready for TechCrunch.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.920]   This is competitive compensation.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.680]   Actually, it's funny because MG said, well,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.800]   digit is this memo true.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.000]   Google's response is, well, while we don't typically
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.320]   comment on internal matters, we will
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.760]   leave the competitive compensation plans
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.400]   are important to the future of the company.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.360]   Somebody in the comments said, that's akin to saying,
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.640]   what did you have for breakfast and responding?
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.880]   It's a non-answer.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.800]   But I think it's, I believe it.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.440]   I wonder how many of those big hires Facebook got from Google
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.160]   were already rich.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.760]   Right, they already got the options.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.200]   They weren't doing it for money to go to Facebook
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.320]   and so no amount of money.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.760]   You're stuck in the-- thousands not enough.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.800]   How much is enough?
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   Right.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.720]   Well, the whole thing is a little bit--
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.360]   it kind of feels a little pedestrian and it's sort of strange.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.440]   I don't want to like, besmirch a billion dollars
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.200]   or whatever they're going to have to pay out and payroll.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.680]   But the whole thing just kind of seems a little bit like,
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.120]   I don't know, just to do something
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.760]   that's not going to be a company why it doesn't seem--
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.120]   doesn't give the kind of attitude that you would think
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.040]   Google wants to show their engineers that they're really
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.600]   progressive and doing something crazy.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.840]   So what does Gawker do?
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.640]   Well, every time I've ever gone to Nick
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.200]   and said that I'm leaving for Facebook, he says--
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.800]   Say yeah, bye.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.240]   I think what Nick stops beating you up.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.960]   All right, I want to hit you again.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.320]   Nick lets you out of the basement.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.720]   Well, I just want everybody to know,
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.960]   you're all getting a pair of socks hand-nipped by my mother.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.360]   Actually, my heat is off in the house.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.040]   So I need--
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.200]   Oh, you look cold.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.720]   You look at like eight layers on, dude.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.760]   What's going on?
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.480]   Hey, we moved into a house that he's
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.760]   with heating oil, which I didn't know they did outside of an Ireland
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.600]   or something.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.400]   So I'm waiting for a truck to come around and pour oil
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.760]   into a tank in my garage.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.600]   I remember those days.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.680]   Heating oil.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.000]   When I lived in New England, I'm sure, Jeff, you know this experience.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.640]   The truck comes.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.240]   They pump oil.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.400]   Once a month, they pump oil into a big tank in your house.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.800]   In my first apartment, I had lived there for six months.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.160]   And one night, I decided I wanted popcorn.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.800]   And I got absolutely enraged that the stove didn't work.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.360]   And I called the gas company in an absolute fit.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.400]   And they told me, you have to call to get it hooked up, sir.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.080]   Six months, I'd never bothered.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.880]   Never cooked a thing.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.640]   Not a thing.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.200]   Not a thing.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   What?
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   You need to have gas?
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.840]   Anybody got a Samsung Galaxy tab?
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.480]   I think today's the day.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.800]   Well, we've got one.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.640]   I haven't actually used it to be completely--
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.480]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.520]   Make judgments anyway.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.760]   Yeah, we don't need to-- you know what Devorex does?
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.040]   Devorex will look at the box and say, no, I can tell you right now.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.040]   [MIMIC SOUNDS]
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.640]   That's why Devorex could push me.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.000]   By the way.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.520]   It's not good.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.040]   Now I guess.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.640]   Set it up.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.280]   Yeah, so Matt Buchanan, one of our senior guys,
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.800]   had just put up his review.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.600]   And there have been some other reviews out there before.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.640]   It's not like we're the first ones to put anything out there.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:47.400]   But Matt pretty much said it's garbage.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.200]   In fairness, there's a lot of things
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.440]   that seem like they're doing right.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.160]   But the fundamental size issue, like the 7-inch tablet,
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.840]   seems like it's just not really a good size.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.960]   You've got phones, which are a certain size,
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.640]   and they're pocketable.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.080]   And you're always going to take that around.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.520]   You've got the iPad, which is less convenient.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.360]   But it's a 9.7-inch screen.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.480]   But the 7-inch size is just a weird in-between size.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.840]   And it could be that maybe Jobs is right that nobody really
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.520]   wants a 7-inch screen.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.160]   Interesting.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.920]   T-Mobile refers to have it, but a sprint tells me
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.040]   that they'll have it Sunday.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.480]   And I've supposedly--
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.880]   Anybody wife I only at?
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.880]   No.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.600]   That's what you're holding out for.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   Now they're all three--
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.200]   Another darn handcuffs on me.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.240]   Sprint's going to have two data plans, a two gigabyte,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.120]   with unlimited messaging $30 a month,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.560]   five gigabytes with unlimited messaging $60 a month.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.840]   And I imagine T-Mobile somewhere in there.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.400]   Although T-Mobile tends to be a little more competitive.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.000]   You know, nowadays you get virgins Wi-Fi--
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.800]   No, that's a good deal.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.880]   --reggo for $25 unlimited.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.840]   So why pay them for the contract just Wi-Fi it?
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.600]   Because it doesn't have Wi-Fi.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.840]   Now you know why.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.400]   Because people like you.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.080]   And by the way, that virgin is sprint.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.280]   They own Virgin Mobile.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.720]   So I think--
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.360]   I think when we're just Virgin users--
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.200]   No, they-- no, it initially was Virgin
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.000]   uses the Sprint network.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.440]   A couple of years ago, they bought it outright.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.000]   So I think the reason you're getting that cut rate on a Wi-Fi
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.560]   from Virgin, it's $20 less than the parent company,
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.120]   is because they're moving to 4G.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.600]   They want to kind of want to clear out the 3G units.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.120]   I don't know.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.320]   I mean, they'd like you to buy it.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.080]   They do make an overdrive now that is dual 3G 4G.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.720]   And I think that that's the reason they're saying,
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.200]   well, we'd like to sell that at the sprint stores.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.560]   I just got to test you to the clear wire one, the 4G,
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.680]   which I haven't used yet in New York.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.080]   Unfortunately, it's not a Wi-Fi.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.360]   It's a dongle.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:44.840]   But--
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.000]   Do you have 4G in Portland, Joel?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.560]   Yeah, there is 4G up here.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.360]   And I don't really--
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.920]   I mean, I've played around it with 4G, everything,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.760]   whenever it's set up.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.760]   But I just use good old 3G at home.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.120]   But yeah, Portland was one of the first test markets, actually.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.400]   Right.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.080]   That's what I thought.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.200]   Yeah, you were-- that's the first place they put clear wire.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.800]   And there was a lot of talk.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.080]   When it first came out that just Wi-Fi and everything
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.800]   before it, that, oh, we'll replace ISPs with it.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.000]   And we won't have to use wires anymore.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.160]   But just from anecdotal experience,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.920]   I don't know anybody using it like that.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.320]   So people are just kind of using it
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.880]   like slightly better 3G.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.280]   T-Mobile says the Scallaxy tab will be--
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.440]   sorry, $3.99 with a two-year contract.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:33.960]   That's rough.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.120]   Or $5.99 with no contract to get a plan $25 a month
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.520]   for 200 megabytes of data.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.160]   That's more like the AT&T pricing.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.280]   And then for 40 month a month, you get 5 gigabytes.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.120]   So I think if you're a heavy data user,
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.480]   the 40 is better than 60 on sprint.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.120]   T-Mobile, but then T-Mobile--
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.560]   and that, you should really check the area.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.800]   Because some areas T-Mobile has this HSPA+
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.320]   which is actually pretty fast.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.240]   I just can't imagine using a tablet or something
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.080]   like that for two years.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.840]   Like, what an Android tablet is going
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.480]   to look like two years from now or a year from now?
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.680]   Really good point.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.760]   Yeah, true.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.680]   And I buy tons of stuff, but I always sell it really quickly,
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.200]   too.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.360]   I just bought a new Air, so I'm selling my iPad,
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.280]   but I'll probably get another iPad.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.520]   And it's like this whole cycle.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.880]   And I don't mind paying service fees for connectivity, 3G
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.600]   or whatever, from the companies, if I have to.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.680]   But I don't want to sign contracts for every single gadget
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.320]   that I own.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.280]   That's just so silly.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.000]   No, I agree.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.120]   So what did your reviewer not like about the Galaxy tab?
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.360]   Was it that the Android didn't scale--
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.480]   besides the fact that the 7 inches is the wrong size,
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.120]   how did the Android look?
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.840]   Did it scale well to 7 inches?
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.360]   That'd be my concern.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.360]   Yeah, actually.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.120]   So you know how when you have an iPad,
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.240]   and you're using iPhone apps on an iPad,
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.080]   you scale up, it looks horrible, and nobody does that?
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.160]   So apparently on the tab, on a 7 inch screen,
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.560]   taking an Android app and scaling it up,
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.600]   it looks a lot better because the screen isn't that much bigger.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.480]   But that's kind of like the core of his negativity
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.840]   about the size is like, if you scale it up
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.760]   and it doesn't really change the way you use it that much,
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.320]   why bother having this whole extra device?
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.920]   So I think a lot of the criticisms, too, though--
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.920]   this is typical Android problem, which
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.320]   is if you're operating outside of the Google experience,
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.200]   like whatever their core Android distro is,
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.840]   it's always a crapshoot on how good the manufacturers are
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.160]   going to tweak it.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.640]   And also, this is the first real implementation
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.480]   outside of third party Chinese crap vendors
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.640]   who are making a proper tablet.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.080]   So I feel like if you're really hardcore into Android,
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.560]   again, not having used it, I don't
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.360]   think this is any indication that Android's
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.000]   going to be a bad platform for tablets,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.600]   and it'll probably get a lot better really quickly.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.440]   But it just seems like maybe this hardware isn't quite
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.400]   what people want.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.960]   Looks like Team Mobile, anyways, pushing entertainment.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.600]   They're pushing the Kindle app, movies, music.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.640]   They see this as an entertainment, kind of like an R-coast.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.000]   Well, I think it's what everybody's pushed with tablets,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.400]   even Apple.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.880]   Apple will talk about productivity and all of that stuff.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:33.280]   But I see most people using iPads in public,
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.760]   on planes, reading things, consuming stuff,
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.720]   and not to get into the whole what is an iPad 4 argument.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.960]   But I think the reason that you see Amazon advertising
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.200]   the Kindle against the iPad or the Blackberry tablet that's
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.400]   coming out is going to have--
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.600]   is very entertainment focused for RIM.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.360]   It's an incredibly entertainment focused playbook.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.000]   Yeah, the playbook.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.840]   I just think that that's what people--
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.320]   as a gift and at this price point and at this dollar amount,
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.920]   this is what people are--
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.400]   it's easier just to say to people,
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.400]   this is going to be for watching movies and playing games
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.520]   and reading books than--
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.360]   well, it's like a net book, but it's not quiet,
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.160]   and it has these limitations.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.120]   So yeah, it's definitely like all these media players
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.280]   that for years we've been trying to get to take off R-coast
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.400]   and that whole PMP Windows stuff years ago.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.960]   These tablets, for all the extra capability they have,
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.320]   that's still a lot of their core use.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.040]   How about the Google Apps themselves?
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.520]   I wonder how they look on it.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.640]   I mean, my real goal for it would be to, yes, watch entertainment,
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:44.560]   do email, read the times, do that kind of stuff.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.160]   I'm not a game player, so it's not going to matter to me.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.640]   Yeah, I like games on the iPad and the iPhone,
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.880]   but yeah, it's got to have--
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.760]   most of the people I know who use the iPad
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.800]   use it as a productivity tool as much as anything else.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.160]   And I definitely do too, but I also
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:04.120]   feel like geeky use of iPads is maybe not the best--
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.720]   is maybe not indicative of the way most people use it.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.840]   Yeah, that's bad truth.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.320]   But I also think it's going to change a little bit too.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.320]   You have to give these products time to expand and grow,
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.760]   and you have to give mainstream audiences time
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.160]   to understand what they even own.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.400]   So I think you had with the iPhone--
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.840]   and I don't think this was all grand planned by Apple,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.800]   but one of the brilliant things about the iPhone
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.880]   was that it came out and it had a few things
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.880]   that it was better at doing browsing the web
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.680]   and just the general interface, but it couldn't do a lot
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.560]   of other stuff.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.880]   And Apple's really good at doling out
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.440]   a little more capability and a little more capability
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:44.160]   as you go forward and teaching the audience what they can do.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.440]   And so I think productivity on all these tablets
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.080]   is going to be secondary as people go, hey,
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.000]   I brought this so I can watch movies,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.880]   but I'm going to try to edit a spreadsheet,
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.760]   and maybe this won't suck.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.280]   As always, what looked like the iPad looked like its success
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.120]   was that it filled a lot of niches.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.040]   Yeah, it's not good at anything.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.080]   Well, I'm not sure I'd say that.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.640]   I mean, it's great for watching movies.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.360]   It's actually pretty good for reading.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.600]   You're right, it's not as good as a Kindle.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.880]   It's better to watch on a TV than an iPad.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.000]   And I love the iPad.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.920]   I think it's a great platform, but that's--
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.000]   If you were going to buy Joel, if you're
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.560]   going to buy a device other than a phone--
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.120]   well, I can't see the wrong way to say it.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.080]   If you were going to buy an iPad, given the current choices,
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.220]   do you think you'd go for the 7-inch Android or Dell's 5-inch
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.440]   Android?
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.760]   Oh, gosh.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.040]   Well--
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.360]   Dells is a joke.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.440]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, look at that ad.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.360]   Have you seen the Dell Streak ad?
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.280]   It looks like they're holding something that's
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.920]   swole up.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.040]   It's just wrong.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.400]   It's like a big candy bar.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.720]   Like they're holding a Hershey bar.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.760]   It's just terrible.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.080]   But it's funny that you say that because it's still smaller
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.080]   than in some dimensions.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.960]   Well, but it's smaller than the iPad, too.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.760]   But what I'm saying is it's almost like Uncanny Valley.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.880]   There's an area between two decent areas, which is a phone.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.320]   The 4.3 is as big as you can get, right?
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.520]   The DRITE X or the EVO.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.520]   And the iPad, which is the right size for the iPad,
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.920]   and there's those two work.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.240]   Well, the thing to me-- and this is
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.200]   tenuously about Google-- but I do
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.040]   think there's-- when I hold an iPad and I use it,
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.240]   I feel like it's right on the edge of being too small.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.160]   There's times where I'm like, oh, I wish this was just
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.960]   a little bit bigger.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.760]   Really?
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.120]   But I also don't want it to be bigger
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.400]   because I want it to be portable and to carry it around
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.600]   and all of that stuff.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.920]   So I think a lot of the magic in any device screen size
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.520]   is finding where that point of tension is, where it's like,
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.880]   OK, this is-- I wish it was a little bit bigger,
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.600]   but I'm glad it's no bigger.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.200]   And the iPhone does that very well.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.720]   And the iPad does that very well.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.200]   And all of these other explorations of screen sizes,
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.720]   I don't think there's a magic number.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.000]   But I think there's probably a magic zone that Apple's probably
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.440]   somewhere within it, and there's not a lot of room to play there.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.560]   Yeah, so Steve was right.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.800]   Steve was right.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.080]   Gina, are you tempted by any of these tablets yet?
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:07.960]   No, not yet.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.080]   It's going to be a while.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.160]   They ought to work it out.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.120]   I'm not going to be tempted until Google says this
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.280]   is the right version of Android to run on a tablet.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.720]   Well, you know what they're saying now,
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.280]   3.0 is imminent, right?
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.120]   Gingerbread.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.920]   Although somebody said 2.3 is out coming out soon, too.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   I'm very confused.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.720]   So there's 2.3 maybe an interim thing than gingerbread,
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.320]   because they already got the gingerbread man.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.840]   And then-- but it turns out that it's honeycomb, really,
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.600]   is what you want.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.680]   I'm very confused.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.000]   Google's message is not clear.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.440]   It isn't.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.480]   And this is an Android problem.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.960]   I don't think it's hurting them, though.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.720]   Well, they're selling a lot of phones.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.560]   God knows.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.760]   Well, no, I mean, it becomes a generic device.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:52.400]   I think, yes, there's the magic to the iPhone fine.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.120]   And the iPad.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.320]   But then beyond that, I went to the quadrangle 4.0.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.200]   So you know where I'm at?
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.440]   It's just real quickly.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.240]   Look at the phone in her hand.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.960]   They need to hire-- this is the Dell Streak Ed.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.480]   They need to hire models with bigger hands.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480]   Yeah, they do.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480]   We talked about this on--
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.320]   That's about players.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.840]   Because look at that.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.040]   There's something just not right about it.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.120]   It's like, look how big that is.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.480]   I don't know.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.720]   She carries it well, though.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.400]   She carries it well.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.320]   And then he's got one.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.560]   And look, they both have weird chocolate bars in their hands.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.400]   It's just--
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.280]   You're med for each other.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.440]   Oh, you're one of the three other people who have this phone.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.000]   We must be true love.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.040]   So that's a Dell Streak.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.760]   That's a five-incher.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.920]   Seven-inches not quite right.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.000]   Part of this also is really the operating system and apps
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.640]   have to--
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.760]   this is what Steve actually said in that earnings call.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.480]   He said, it's a developer issue.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.760]   They're not thinking like developers.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.240]   They're thinking like, how are hardware manufacturers?
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.320]   We can make it.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.800]   He says, but we're software guys.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.080]   We think, yeah, but how's it going to look?
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.880]   And can you make software that fits on a three and a half,
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:05.400]   four, five, seven, and up screen that works in all of them?
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.480]   It's also though pocket size.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.720]   I think that the Streak is the largest possible thing that
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.360]   will fit--
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.800]   Will it fit a man's pocket?
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.600]   Will it fit in my jacket pocket?
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.240]   Your coat pocket.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   But didn't you know what?
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.640]   Jeff, you're the last man who still wears a jacket.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.480]   If it doesn't fit--
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.360]   It fits in my ironic overalls front pocket.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.400]   Oskash, there you go.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.120]   But I think it has to fit in the breast pocket of your shirt,
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.480]   doesn't it?
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.960]   Yeah, that one gets a little--
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.440]   Who even puts a phone in the breast pocket over there?
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.640]   Phones are for pockets, at best.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.720]   Maybe belt clips if you must.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.520]   Well, he got rid of his pocket protector,
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.320]   so just don't make fun of him.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.680]   You're telling me that you think it's superior
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:53.640]   to have a belt carrier than inhabit your front pocket?
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   No.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   Like, thigh pocket?
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.160]   No, because, well, I have keys in one and one and the other,
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.640]   and I don't want to sit on it, so I can't put it in my butt
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.120]   pocket.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.000]   So it's got to go in the front.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.160]   Really, am I nerdy for putting my phone there?
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.800]   I don't think you're supposed to put anything
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.760]   in your front pockets, except for handkerchiefs,
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.640]   is the only thing that is possibly supposed to go in there.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.640]   You want to know the real truth?
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.600]   Half the time I got two phones in my front pocket.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.720]   Yeah, well, we're all outliers.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.640]   If you've ever looked at a Scott Evest,
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.640]   I've been like, well, maybe, then you're really fast.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.480]   Well, Joel, Joel, this is a Scott Evest shirt.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.600]   I like Scott Evest stuff, but I'm just saying,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.840]   if you're at that point where you're looking for cable runs
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.280]   and your shirt, you can kind of--
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.280]   I got it.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:37.800]   --word with it.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.480]   So that's why I keep it in my front pocket,
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.200]   because I have a hole there that can go right up
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.440]   through here to the headphones and go around my back,
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.880]   and it's never mine.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.520]   I'm saying you're part of the problem.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.120]   I just feel that it camouflages my man boobs.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.200]   And not accentuate.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.720]   You take on geek boobs.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.920]   Oh, it might accentuate them.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.200]   I never thought of that.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.160]   Well, this is a thing that accentuates just ones.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.400]   You're like, you know, you've got the, like, pretty boob.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.800]   I mean, that's not good.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.680]   It's really has changed my entire perspective on it.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.640]   So I'd like to rescind everything I said before.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.720]   No, you were right.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.840]   They're agreeing with you.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.640]   Don't put it in your breast pocket.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.120]   Well, and I think to get back to the size of things,
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.200]   like, you're never going to put an iPad in your pocket, which
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.680]   means it might be the right size, you know?
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.520]   And all these other tablets, any time they show--
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.880]   this is so typical-- I mean, I've seen it hundreds of times
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.760]   over the years as a gadget blogger.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.400]   It's like, they'll show you these model pictures of people
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.720]   using it, and it has absolutely no relevance
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.600]   to the real world.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.120]   So you have to actually look out in the real world
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.040]   and see what people would do with it.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.520]   Or what I often do is take stuff and show my friends,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.520]   like, at a bar or something, and say, like, what would you
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.160]   do with this?
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.480]   And if they wouldn't put it in their pocket,
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.920]   then, you know, it's not-- nobody else is going.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.440]   We're talking about Android.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.200]   Some Android sales numbers out.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.640]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.760]   Gina's got a-- but you haven't set it up yet, the Google TV.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.360]   No, yeah, I haven't received it yet.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.240]   I have mine.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.080]   I've talked about it already a little bit.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.120]   How you doing?
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.600]   Look at Leo.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   He's got to ruin me.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.960]   You know, I'm really tempted to unhook it.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.800]   But I'm going to wait until Gina-- you know, here's--
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.720]   well, we'll talk about it in a second.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.440]   There is a deal.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.200]   Have you seen this?
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.480]   This is the new Windows Mobile Fund.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.560]   I saw you showing up.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.760]   I was watching your demo a little bit before the show.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.120]   It's mobile.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:23.880]   You know, it's sad.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.720]   It's slushy.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.880]   Had this-- it's actually very snappy.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.200]   Had this come out before the iPhone and the Android phone?
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.360]   You'd be going, this is the amazing--
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.160]   Would that have come out before Android and iPhone?
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.360]   Oh, well, I guess not.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.480]   Not in that way.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.880]   I guess not.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.600]   But you like it.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.760]   Well, it's fine.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.120]   But we already have Android and iPhone and Blackberry,
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.840]   if you want to be really generous.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.560]   And is there any logic to it?
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.400]   How's the UIs?
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.000]   They're a lot of different--
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   It's fine.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.920]   I love it.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.240]   Yeah, you know, it's a nice UI.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.960]   It's very usable.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.480]   It's very-- I'll tell you what.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.640]   There's a lesson for Google in a couple of areas.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:10.080]   First of all, because Microsoft said, this is the hardware spec
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.400]   and you must adhere to the hardware spec, all of them
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.960]   have the same 5 megapixel camera, the same gigahertz
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.200]   processor.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.360]   There is a varied amount of RAM and storage.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.600]   But essentially, you're getting an 800 by 480 screen.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.440]   There's a certain consistency across the hardware
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.320]   that is a good thing.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.440]   And that's one of the problems Android has.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.720]   But of course, Android is open.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.040]   I was thinking about this this morning.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.920]   Google, of course, knew that that would be an issue.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.960]   But they chose-- from a philosophical point of view,
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.480]   we prefer to open source it, to keep the open handset
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.160]   alliance, to let the manufacturers do what they want with it.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.760]   Because-- and it's worked for them.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.400]   We're going to talk about those numbers in a bit.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.680]   By the other hand, I think Microsoft can quite reasonably
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.000]   say, yes, but look, this is a very consistent experience
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.440]   across the board.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.080]   This is the Samsung Focus, which is very much like the
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.920]   Captivate, the Galaxy S that Samsung has Android on.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.640]   So just think of it kind of as a Galaxy S.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.680]   Are you taking Pilates?
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.400]   Yeah, every three times a week.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.080]   You should see my core.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.440]   I'm working on my-- it's all about the man boobs.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.440]   So these are the tiles.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.360]   You see, and you can have your friends in the--
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.240]   you can have these-- everybody has a tile.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.120]   It's very people focused and socially focused.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.120]   So you see how quickly that works, though?
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.320]   So you can see-- I mean, there's just--
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.640]   these are recent calls.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.760]   Gee, I don't see us there.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.920]   We don't have tiles.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.200]   You would have a tile if you would tweet or Facebook more
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.720]   often.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.800]   Actually, I think you're on here somewhere, Jeff, because I
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.400]   think you've Facebooked recently.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.520]   These are Facebook posts.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.600]   It's very social.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.400]   Even if you go to the camera app--
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.480]   this was a little disconcerting at first, because it's not
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.080]   just my pictures.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.320]   It's other people's pictures to show up in the camera app.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.560]   So all my friends' pictures are showing up here as well.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.880]   Those look pretty nice.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.680]   It's very pretty.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.640]   I mean, that background is randomly
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.080]   chosen from my photos.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.600]   I mean, they've done a nice job with this.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.960]   It's a very good camera, by the way.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.880]   It's a 5 megapixel, very comparable to the iPhone,
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.520]   the detail, and the accuracy, I think, are very good.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.120]   So this is a great phone.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.400]   If they stick with it, if they actually
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.760]   follow through, which has been Microsoft's problem in devices
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.160]   for the last few years, they've got a great start.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.360]   I think they'll end up selling quite a few.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.480]   They've only sold 40--
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.520]   according to some reports, 40,000.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.720]   And I have to say, when I went in to buy this,
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.960]   I was the only one.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.800]   I thought I was buying an iPhone.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:36.680]   I don't know.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.320]   I went-- it'd be in half an hour before the store opened.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.400]   It was kind of quiet.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.880]   It was like nobody.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.240]   And then they opened the door.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.280]   And I'm the one guy standing in front.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.320]   I can remember waiting in line at this AT&T store
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.240]   three years in a row for an iPhone, where there's crowds.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.800]   The big deal, they're opening the door.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.600]   They're opening the door, guys, says, yeah, come on in.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.720]   I'm here to buy a focus.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   But it's not going to be a big consumer.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.480]   It's not going to happen.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.000]   You know how many they had Joel in stock?
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.120]   A lot.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:04.840]   Two.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.200]   Oh, that's all they had actually gotten in to begin with.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.280]   They had two.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.880]   So when you hear two mobile said, we're sold out of the HD7,
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.840]   you might ask.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.800]   And how many was that?
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   But that's OK.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.360]   I mean, how many G1s were sold three years ago?
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.920]   Oh, and this is better than the G1.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.960]   This is infinitely better than the G1.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.920]   These will be sold through channel partnerships.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.200]   And these aren't going to happen in the same kind
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.320]   of consumer way.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.960]   And if they end up nailing some of the Xbox integration
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.360]   and stuff like that, where--
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.080]   Oh, they did nail the Xbox integration.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.040]   It's fantastic.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.440]   Yeah, but it's sending it so that it becomes like,
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.920]   if you have an Xbox, that it's almost essential that you
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.680]   have a Windows 7 phone.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.280]   There's me.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.520]   That's my little mee-ble.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.520]   That's cool.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.020]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.480]   And my achievements go right to the Xbox.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.720]   Some of these games can round-trip from the Xbox.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.560]   And also, don't forget that--
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.640]   could talk to this week, had all but confirmation,
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.360]   not to plug a bunch of other gawk or sites, especially
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.400]   Kataku, which is horrible, just kidding.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.040]   Don't be in trouble.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.760]   But we've pretty much--
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.680]   Microsoft's confirmed to both me and Kataku
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.280]   that without confirming that their connect technology
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.080]   is coming to your phone.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:15.840]   That's--
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.520]   So you could wave at the phone?
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.840]   Yeah, so eventually, these phones
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.080]   are going to end up being little connect projectors, too.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   And that's pretty amazing.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.640]   That gives them a hook that Apple is working on, clearly,
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.040]   from the acquisitions and patents and such.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.360]   This doesn't have the voice everywhere that Android has.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.680]   But it's pretty-- it's close.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.200]   This week in Google--
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.800]   let's see.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.080]   It's pretty decent.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.400]   I mean, so that's being--
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.800]   I think I was saying other things,
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.200]   so it didn't-- it only heard the Google.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.880]   But it does-- it's actually not a bad phone.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.240]   It syncs, by the way, with my Google accounts,
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.000]   although it's a little nonintuitive.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.120]   You have to choose Outlook to sync to the Google accounts.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.800]   But once you do-- because it's using EAS--
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.520]   but once you do it, my Google-- all my stuff,
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.160]   Google propagated over, as well as Facebook and Twitter
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.120]   and everything.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.680]   Is this going to be the phone that's
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.800]   sort of big companies with IT departments based heavily
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.040]   in exchange are going to want?
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.360]   I mean, is this going to be the phone
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   that they feel comfortable with?
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.680]   I mean, I feel like Xbox and exchange
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.800]   or slash Outlook are the two big--
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.720]   It's a very consumer-y phone, though.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.400]   I got to tell you.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.920]   I mean, it's not a business-y phone.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.320]   It's not a Blackberry, you know?
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.600]   Yeah, but everybody-- all those consumer--
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.200]   or all those business phones are moving in a consumer direction.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.680]   And think how many times, a couple of years ago,
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.560]   you were hearing complaints from sys admins saying,
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.240]   we've got all these execs wanting iPhones on our network,
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.760]   and how do we integrate all that?
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.760]   And all the phones are moving together.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.440]   I don't think there's going to be a big difference
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.920]   between business and consumer phones.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.400]   And I guess, in a way, that's the point,
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.960]   is that this looks very much--
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.000]   I mean, it's unique, and they were smart to do the tiles,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.840]   because you look at it, you immediately know it's a Windows
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.280]   phone.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.080]   But it's very much influenced by Android and iPhone.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.440]   And it's basically the same hardware
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.080]   as everybody else is doing.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.160]   Well, I kind of like it.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:05.760]   It's just it's not--
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.000]   To do their credit, the thing that all the hardware
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.560]   and all the phones in the world right now,
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.080]   except for things in the periphery, are pretty much the same.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.680]   So the only thing that's really differentiating things
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.880]   is UI and is design.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.640]   And the fact that Microsoft is taking--
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.080]   I mean, they're leading in some ways.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.360]   They're going in a different direction than Apple,
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.160]   which Google did not do at all.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.280]   Android, for as much as it's done right,
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.520]   is pretty much a feature for feature clone of iOS.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.440]   And I think it's surprising that Microsoft
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.240]   is the one that's gone in that direction.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   But devices, E&E, has always been that group within the Microsoft
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.920]   that's been willing to take those risks.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.760]   This feels much less geeky.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:53.160]   I can see why they might and have pitched this at feature
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.720]   phone and non-geeks.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.400]   I mean, it would be a logical upgrade for somebody
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.200]   with a feature phone who was scared of the complexity
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.640]   of smartphones, particularly of Android.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.080]   This is very-- I've given it to a number of people who said,
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.200]   can you figure it out?
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:07.840]   No trouble.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   I mean, it's very easy.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.680]   And it feels--
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.600]   To this day, Android--
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   Not easy.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.480]   --it will throw me once in a while,
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.000]   I'll miss the logic of something.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.560]   Yeah, well, we know that.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.360]   We know that about you.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.240]   And this has things that Apple does not
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.240]   have that are very nice in Android, a back button,
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.640]   a search button.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.200]   It has-- you press and hold to do kind of like the right-click
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.800]   style contextual stuff.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.400]   All of that is intuitive, I think, and really is not there.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.600]   And in fact, when I go back to an iPhone from an Android phone,
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.080]   I really miss the back button.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.280]   It's like, I just want to do what I was doing a second ago.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.360]   What I got to exit out.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.680]   I got to go, d-d-e-d-e-d-e-d-e-d-e-d-e.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.040]   What are notifications like on Windows Phone?
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.640]   Notifications are very much like Android.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.840]   You can really see how they've kind of cross-pollinated.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.080]   They come in at the top in a bar here.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.600]   There isn't a pull-down thing.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.520]   You have to tap it.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.280]   But I think it's better than iPhone,
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.120]   although it's a little more modal than Android.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.880]   Android still is the winner on notifications, absolutely.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.240]   That is the one thing that Google has just dominated, I think.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.160]   And I'm shocked that iOS does not have anything even close to it.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.640]   Oh, it's ridiculous.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:25.800]   And I hear-- you hear Apple people.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.240]   Shh.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.800]   They say things like, John Grub will say things.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.680]   Well, it's just better.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.560]   And I'll say, well, feature by feature.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.280]   No, no, it just feels better.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.280]   I just like it better.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.120]   It's more aesthetic.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.520]   The pixels are aligned perfectly.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.440]   It's like, no, no, but what's the feature?
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:42.960]   No, no.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.600]   You don't understand.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.640]   It's not about features.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.920]   It's about fit and finish.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.880]   It's about all of those things, though.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.200]   It can be about all these things.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.520]   But that's very subjective.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.360]   And to say, this phone is better because of my subjective opinion
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.440]   that it has a better feel is not an argument.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:33:59.720]   It's just--
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.560]   Well, welcome to gadget reviewing.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.200]   I can imagine.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.840]   I mean, that's basically-- first of all,
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.520]   I think it's totally fair to say that something has a feel.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.240]   And you can quantify what feel is if it's precision,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.120]   if it's responsiveness.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.920]   And the iPhone and the iOS stuff does--
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.200]   you saw everybody, I think, where all the geeks saw the touchscreen grid
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:25.080]   test where they showed how the iOS devices were more accurate than Android,
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.600]   which was slightly more accurate than anything.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.560]   I've been a ran a lot.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.680]   I'm older than you, Joel.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:33.080]   I remember when people said the same thing about windows and mousing.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.000]   Oh, the Mac mouse is direct drive.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.200]   The windows mouse isn't.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.520]   It's just not quite the same.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.000]   You know what?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.880]   Give me a break.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.680]   That's why windows and Mac just completely dis slaughtered windows
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.440]   in the marketplace.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.880]   Well, the problem is an aesthetic argument doesn't guarantee sales.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.160]   Not only does it not guarantee sales, it doesn't resonate with anybody.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.520]   It's an elitist argument.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.800]   It just feels better.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.880]   My most 80s just drives better.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.400]   It's a bit--
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.360]   It obviously resonates with 100 million iOS users.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.040]   Oh, let's talk about sales in just a second.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.400]   I've been meaning to take a break.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.560]   But we will get to those numbers in just a second.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.960]   Before I do, though, I have to tell you about a great company
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.000]   called Citrix that just feels better.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.560]   It is-- actually, Citrix is kind of like the Mercedes
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.520]   of remote access.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.320]   If you know the name Citrix, you're
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.960]   working in enterprise, you know all about Citrix.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.200]   And the consumer products are just as good and really easy to use.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.200]   I'm going to give you an example.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.600]   Go to Assist Express, which is their support product.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.480]   Now, look, you're a geek.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.840]   You know a little bit about support.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.320]   In fact, I know a lot of people who listen are in IT
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.000]   or support software.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.440]   But all of us, at least, at the very least support family
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.600]   and friends, this is a program you will like.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.920]   Now, if you do it occasionally, they do have a day pass.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.320]   But this is really aimed at the professional support
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.440]   person.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.560]   And the monthly fee is so affordable.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.400]   And it means you can have unlimited support sessions.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.800]   You can even have eight going on at any one time.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.040]   So you could start an install or a scan on one machine,
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.200]   move to the next move to the next.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.760]   So it's very efficient with your time.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.280]   Unattended support.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.080]   But best of all, the people you're supporting
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.760]   don't have to have it installed ahead of time.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.280]   All you have to do is send them a link.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.200]   They click the link 30 seconds later.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.800]   You're in fixing their system.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.760]   I want you to try GoToAssist Express free for 30 days.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.520]   I've been using it for more than 10 years.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.480]   And it's better and better and better.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.080]   I can go on and on about the great features.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.240]   You know, the GoToAssist Express users
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.320]   say they get-- this is a recent study-- 40% increase
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.040]   in productivity by using GoToAssist Express.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.600]   And I believe it, because I see how fast and easy it is to use.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.440]   I just use it with family and friends.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.920]   If you're a pro, you're going to love it.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:45.360]   Try it right now by going to GoToAssist.com/twig.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.520]   TWIG, go to assist.com/twig.

[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.280]   It is the best remote support product out there, period.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.520]   But you don't have to take my word for it.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.440]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.960]   Android smartphone sales top $20 million.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.560]   $20 million in the third quarter alone.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.120]   44% of the market.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:12.680]   Now, we always say how big Nokia is in this.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.720]   Only $29.5 million.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.480]   So while Nokia is doing well, Symbian's doing well
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.200]   is still the best selling worldwide.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.040]   Android is coming on strong.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.360]   It's not hard to imagine a quarter or two from now.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.040]   Android being easily the best selling.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.600]   A man answers your earlier question
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.520]   about not sticking to one size and one spec.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.200]   Yeah, that does, doesn't it?
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.960]   Google made the right choice.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.480]   They made the right choice if they
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.200]   want to have their OS on the most devices.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.960]   Well, and if you're Google, that's what you want, right?
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.320]   Yeah, in theory, I'm still a little iffy on how much revenue
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.360]   they're actually bringing in from those mobile devices.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.480]   But maybe it's just about getting the groundwork out there
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.400]   and doing something with it.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.040]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.800]   There's just tons of value that's going to come back
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.280]   in terms of advertising opportunities, data back,
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.280]   and all kinds of things.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.800]   Schmidt has said, he said last January,
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.160]   that he and she who has the most installs
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.600]   will have the most developers will get the best apps
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.840]   and around and around that virtual cycle goes.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.560]   Well, there's a really important point with the Windows
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.080]   phone.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.840]   The key for Microsoft, they know it.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.400]   It's developers.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.720]   They've got to get apps on here.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.600]   They have actually quite a good set of original apps,
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.360]   but they need to get the key apps like Evernote and so forth.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.640]   And if they don't, I'm not going to switch
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.560]   because I need my apps.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.200]   The Gartner group says that Symbian will continue
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.920]   to outsell Android, at least in the next quarter,
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.760]   due to pricing.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.160]   It's interesting.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.720]   The total number of smart phones, according to Gartner,
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.800]   I think Gartner is pretty good on this,
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.520]   is 81 million units worldwide in the third quarter.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.200]   But that's still only 20% of all phones sold.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.800]   So the market has lots of room to grow.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   Android in the second place spot with 20.5 million.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   One year ago, take a guess.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.000]   Are these your numbers, Jeff?
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.880]   OK.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.400]   Take a guess.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.800]   They got 20 million in the last quarter, a year ago.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.560]   Two?
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.000]   Yeah, 1.4 million.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   To go from 1.4 to 20 million in just a year.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.520]   They're a share of the worldwide smartphone market, 25%.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.960]   I hate to bring it up, Gina, because I know every time we do,
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:31.240]   it's like a stab to your solar plexus.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.240]   You're not going to bring up wave again, are you?
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.440]   Because it doesn't explain why something like wave
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.640]   can be seen as a failure to kill when you see that's
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.560]   the hockey stick standard to kill.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.200]   Right.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.720]   I bemoan that a little bit, though.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.720]   That's public companies in this tech industry have to do that.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.320]   And I don't think that that's a--
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.600]   I mean, if I had to double my--
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.600]   or whatever that is, it's not even doubling.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.680]   If I had 20 times sales every year,
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.000]   I wouldn't be around.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.520]   What company-- it's very few companies can sustain that.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   It's true.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.400]   But I understand that Wall Street expects it in the tech
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:06.920]   industry.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.160]   But don't you think there'd be a lot of great companies out
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:13.520]   there that only groove 10% or 20% a year?
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.040]   That--
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.000]   It's interesting, I think, in the news business,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.240]   is people are talking about creating the low profit
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.520]   company.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.600]   And I didn't fully understand that,
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.360]   until I looked at Craigslist.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.160]   There is a great example.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.600]   Well, because it is, because it's a choice.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.440]   And is he not operating under their--
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.480]   it not operating under its fiduciary responsibility
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.440]   to its shareholders, that is eBay.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.960]   And that becomes the fight.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.000]   So you kind of need permission to be low profit.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.160]   But that strikes me silly.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.600]   My students come to my class and say,
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.080]   I want to be not for profit.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:45.960]   And I say, no, no, no.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.400]   I'm going to turn you into a greedy bastard.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.720]   And sustainability and profit are good.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.200]   But I get it.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.200]   I think you're right.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.760]   There's not a middle ground.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.200]   There's not a way--
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.840]   Google's success does give it some freedom,
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.720]   but also becomes imprisonment for them.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.520]   Impresement how?
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.080]   Because they have to grow, grow, grow, grow, grow.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.360]   You think they have to do that again next year?
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:11.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:12.760]   That's hard.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.640]   That's really hard.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.160]   Smith's--
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.480]   Eric says the biggest challenge they have is growth.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.800]   And it's the double-edged sword.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.480]   Grow this much.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.480]   You have to keep growing that much.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.880]   It's really hard to grow that much when you've already
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.480]   grown that much.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.800]   Well, you have to enter new markets.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   So Google entered the cell phone market
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.000]   because you couldn't grow search at that rate.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:29.960]   So they enter the cell phone market.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.320]   And they were able to do that.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.480]   But then it can't be in this.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.720]   I mean, you're not going to grow another 20 times.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.520]   And then B is then you get worse and worse and worse
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.400]   at right hand, meet left hand.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.320]   Chrome and meet Android and how does all that work?
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.520]   And that becomes harder and harder and harder.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.880]   And that has been a lot of Google's probably.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.320]   So size is its own enemy.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.120]   Gartner also says component shortages are more likely
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.360]   to hit Android than Symbian.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.960]   I would imagine iPhone as well, things like these screens.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:04.560]   I know these super AMOLED screens are in great short supply.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.080]   NAND, memory, flash, that kind of stuff.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.560]   So you could see that you might not
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.160]   be able to grow this market just because you can't get it.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:13.480]   You can't--
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.840]   Well, the next market for Android has to be feature phones
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   in these interesting--
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:18.200]   Oh, interesting.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.840]   --developing countries.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.200]   The reason Nokia even exists still in any form
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.800]   is not because of the smartphone stuff.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.200]   So ignore all the smartphones, Symbian stuff.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.320]   It's all of these handsets they're selling to India and maybe
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.760]   China unless I don't know in China specifically.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.800]   But they're selling developing economy phones.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:42.920]   And so if the materials cost for these older smartphones,
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.960]   especially Android phones, can get down low enough.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.520]   And there can be a local company that localizes
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.240]   the interfaces and things like that.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.000]   It's entirely possible that Android could come in and start
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.080]   chewing through the feature phone market in India.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.580]   And if you do that, then all of a sudden you have hundreds
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.720]   of millions of units a year open.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.400]   That isn't even the smartphone market necessarily.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.400]   Right.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.080]   That's interesting.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.000]   I would never have thought the feature phone market
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:10.600]   would be desirable.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.520]   But that's us geeks again saying, well,
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.840]   why would you want a feature phone?
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.080]   Well, I think the idea, well, A idea and idea,
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.000]   is that the division between feature phone and smartphone
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.320]   is really good.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:23.820]   Sure.
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.920]   It's not really a feature phone.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.920]   It's like a less smartphone.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.720]   A simple phone.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.080]   A phone you can text tweet maybe.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.640]   We kind of used to say like a smartphone was a phone
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.480]   you could put apps on or before there were even apps.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.560]   But something where you could put software on it.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.880]   And that made it a smartphone.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.720]   But then you got like Mossberg calling things super smartphones.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.160]   And the whole thing is silly.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.960]   Really at this point comes down to cost almost
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.400]   than anything else.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.640]   Is it a cheap phone that gets like a crazy long battery life
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.600]   and is durable and local people can fix and support?
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.640]   That might be an iPhone.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.760]   That might be an Android phone.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.960]   But it's external factors at this point.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.160]   There was a news story last week about just that.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.320]   I can't remember who it was.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.920]   I'm looking up now and not finding it.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.840]   That said that there was development effort.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.640]   It's like the-- it's the holy grail
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.680]   like Negroponte's $100 laptop.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.160]   Ah, yeah.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:14.680]   Right?
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   It's the point of the very--
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:16.680]   Well, yeah.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   And those projects have always been ridiculous.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.080]   I mean, no offense to Negroponte, who I have a lot of the respect
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.040]   for other things he's done.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:29.280]   The $100 laptop idea is so silly because you're basically
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:34.040]   creating a whole new market that doesn't even really
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:38.000]   reflect what the existing markets reflect in those places.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.040]   If you look at Africa, the most common scenario in Africa
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.320]   is a big thing to generalize.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:49.920]   But you have a lot of people just using one phone in a village
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.400]   of 50 people or whatever.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.320]   And trying to do these one laptop per child projects that
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.120]   have no greater infrastructure within capitalism
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.400]   is a really weird way to try to distribute that stuff.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.080]   I think it's a lot more likely to--
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:02.640]   You're right.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.400]   And the next three billion people
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.720]   who are going to come on the internet are going
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.480]   to come on through phones, they say.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   I think so.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:09.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.480]   And the better phone that we can put out there,
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   the more connectivity they have, the more they'll
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.080]   be able to learn, the more they'll be able to do transactions
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.760]   and economics, the more they'll be able to do
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.680]   all kinds of things.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.200]   And the beautiful thing about Android
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.720]   is for as much as it frustrates me
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.960]   that it fragments just like all these open source operating
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.200]   systems do, all it's going to take is one person.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.960]   In those local markets, who knows better
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.320]   than any of the Western companies, what they need
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.880]   to take that baseline of Android and do it,
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.960]   and then all of a sudden that could be another millions
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.400]   and millions of customers for Google
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.680]   that they didn't even know they were going to get.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.320]   And Joel, the other key to this is
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.320]   that we tend to think one phone per person
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.480]   or two phones per person and five phones per person for us.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:55.360]   And instead, what it is is multiple people per phone.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.280]   And I saw a story-- again, I can't find it right now.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.000]   But an entrepreneur in developing the world
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.560]   was creating the infrastructure to be
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.480]   able to have multiple accounts on one phone.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.120]   So I gave them the Google+ for a while.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.360]   It's not--
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.360]   It's transitional, but we want the transition.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.560]   The transition is good.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.320]   And at the distribute, these phones with Google Voice
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.200]   built in, they're providing the service
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.560]   to text and the call too, which is just
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.040]   kind of more opportunities for--
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:25.520]   That's a good point.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.000]   --natural advertising.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.760]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:33.040]   Google Voice might be the killer app for a feature phone.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.040]   Interesting.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.920]   And carriers like it because they do a lot of infrastructure
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.520]   stuff like voicemail you don't have to do now.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:44.520]   Moving along.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:44.760]   Let's see.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.800]   We did the galaxy.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.880]   We did the-- how about now that you're
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.120]   getting your Google TV?
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.560]   More blockage.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.800]   And more stuff I can't get on it.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.320]   More stuff you can't get on it.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.040]   Now, in fact, sci-fi.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.600]   Why would sci-fi block the freaking Google TV?
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.680]   Come on, dudes.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.720]   Is it C-fi?
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:09.520]   That's why-- I know it's sci-fi.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.120]   And fancast.com--
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.320]   backdoor.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.200]   Fancast is the Comcast Xfinity thing.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.400]   Was a backdoor to Hulu.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.760]   I actually was using that because I
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.720]   could get a lot of the Hulu shows that way.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:26.200]   Apparently, that's been blocked.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.320]   I think you're going to just keep seeing this forever.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.840]   There's never been an industry like the content industry
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.600]   that loves to fight the video content.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.360]   Is that a problem for Google TV?
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.400]   I think what happens is this.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.000]   I went to the Quadrangle 4 Square Conference
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.680]   today, which has no relationship to the 4 Square.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.040]   We know a lot.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.400]   And it's a bunch of CEOs in the audience.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.560]   And it's all off the record, but nothing of note
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.320]   is said because they're all public companies.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.640]   And Tim Armstrong and Michael Eisner
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.680]   announced a deal today in which Eisner, who knows his crap
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.760]   about making entertainment, is going
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.640]   to make some stuff that will have an exclusive period on AOL,
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.480]   very distribution and content.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:13.320]   And so I asked, are we now at the tipping point
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:20.040]   where we see something major come and make the internet work
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.440]   as an intermediate?
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.840]   Is that-- are we going to find Howard Stern,
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.200]   as he's threatened to go to the internet?
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:28.760]   Are we going to find the next modern family kind of brand
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.320]   works on the internet?
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.480]   And they said, yeah, because they want it to be that case.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.320]   But I think when that happens, you
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.640]   start to see the unbundling and unraveling of TV
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:45.040]   that a channel is a level of curation
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.000]   that we needed in the past, like a newspaper,
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.440]   that the need of which goes away.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.000]   Because you're going to find stuff wherever.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.880]   And of course, Google becomes the mechanism
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.200]   to be that new curatorial level.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.280]   And channels are what-- it's only part of the process
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.920]   of killing them.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.880]   Someone else at this thing said a big executive
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.640]   said when I asked about various media
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.000]   said that broadcast channels were toast.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.800]   The fact that Fox and cable didn't need Fox.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.680]   They fought for a week.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.400]   And the government is stepping in here
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.680]   in a very non-market way.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.840]   This whole idea of retransmission fees
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.840]   is a false propping up of the old channel.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.640]   This is the FCC's requirement.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.800]   What goes along with must carry, right?
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.680]   You could either demand carriage or demand money.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.360]   And if your local channel--
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.280]   It's the local channels.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.760]   If your Fox carrying the World Series,
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.840]   then you demand-- now you demand money.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.560]   And cable vision tried-- not to have tried to negotiate
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.360]   and finally did cave.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.800]   But I still think this is the beginning of the end
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.720]   for the channels.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.400]   Because they're all going to get carriage.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.720]   CBS now brags that they're depending on carriage fees
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.960]   as much as advertising.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.440]   Where does that money come from?
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.560]   Us!
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.160]   So we're going to pay more for our cable.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.880]   For more channels, we don't want.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.680]   It's going to hit a big bad point.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.240]   And then out of nowhere, some big brand--
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.120]   Iister is going to create a hit.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.560]   It's a hit on AOL.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.080]   We keep waiting for that to happen with the kill,
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.840]   with Dr. Horrible.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.400]   And Felicia Day's not in it.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.440]   I guess it's got no hope.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.880]   But we keep waiting for somebody to do that.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.280]   I don't know what it's going to be.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.240]   But Leo, it's you too.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:23.880]   I mean, I think--
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:24.840]   Well, yeah, this is different.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.360]   So that's episodic television or episodic content.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.240]   And then we also talk about news content.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.960]   I think that that's going to happen first.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.160]   The stuff that we're doing on Twitch, for instance,
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.480]   is much easier to move to that from CNN or from--
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:38.800]   that's a natural.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.120]   Little harder for episodic television.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:41.960]   It is.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.840]   Or get it could be a personality like Stern.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.600]   Reality.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   It's reality shows a change.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.960]   Reality, absolutely.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.320]   So something's going to break here.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.520]   And when that happens, well, you're
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.000]   going to find it, obviously, through digital first.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.560]   There may be some of the guys said at this conference.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.600]   Aftermarket for that on a cable channel or a broadcast
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.120]   channel.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.680]   But its first release is going to be the internet.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.280]   And so when that happens, the whole need to have channels--
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.800]   Right.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.960]   --pretty much goes away.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.840]   And so what you're seeing are the death throws
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.240]   of the old channel structure.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.680]   Now, last piece of this, though, is that--
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.080]   so cable vision tried to basically unbundle Fox.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.080]   It basically said, hey, folks, go watch Glee--
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.800]   uh-oh, we mentioned Glee again--
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.600]   on the internet.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.520]   Don't watch it on Fox, because we don't want to pay him this money.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.680]   And of course, it didn't happen.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.520]   But that's where they're going.
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.320]   But the problem for cable vision was they've
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.600]   got to unbundle themselves first.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.800]   They forced me to buy all these channels I don't want.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.760]   It's worse than forcing me to get all these shows I don't want
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.480]   and pay for now on Fox.
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.080]   And so there's a tipping point that's waiting to happen.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.800]   And they're going to resist for a long time.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.480]   The cable networks will benefit from this new world.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.400]   But it's going to be a painful transition.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.760]   The channels will not benefit, and they'll die.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.240]   And we'll have a new world of TV.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.160]   But it's going to be a really ugly transition,
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:09.360]   just like the transition of news and newspapers.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.160]   Sorry for the--
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.480]   No, I think that this is--
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:12.360]   it's very interesting.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.640]   And everybody's trying to figure out
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.960]   how this is going to play.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.120]   And somebody said in the chat room,
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.120]   I think this is absolutely true.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.600]   Still, 90% of people watch TV on TV.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.000]   And--
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.640]   Yeah, I think the death of television
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.800]   is pretty exaggerated.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.320]   I got it.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:31.840]   The corporate--
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.840]   The corporate.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.840]   --in Canada.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.840]   I mean, you know--
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.320]   No, but I think that you're going to see--
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.600]   you're seeing the cracks in it, though, aren't you?
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.560]   Yeah, we've been seeing the cracks for 15 years.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.920]   Oh, don't be impatient.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:43.840]   These things take time.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.040]   In the words of the Wicked Witch of the West,
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.040]   these things take time.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.640]   We all work online and make our living because the internet--
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.720]   and we're all in our way geeky internet people.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:56.480]   But there's still huge, huge content industries.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.400]   The lion's sure of that stuff is being produced
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.880]   through the old media structures.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:01.880]   And they're not--
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.240]   they do tons of stupid stuff.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:03.960]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.960]   But they still have a lot of clout.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.240]   And they creatively are still where a lot of people
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.480]   end up going.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.800]   So Joss Whedon has a great success
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.440]   with Dr. Horrible.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:17.880]   But that didn't stop him from going on and making Dollhouse.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.680]   Like, just because some of these are successful.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.840]   No, in fact, he did Dr. Horrible during the strike
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.680]   because it was just something to do.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.080]   Dollhouse is where his money is.
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.600]   I have a dream that Nick Denton, my friend Nick,
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.640]   your friend Nick, our friend Nick--
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.880]   He's not my friend Nick.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.800]   The rest of it.
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.320]   The rest of it.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.080]   I never met him.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.080]   I don't know.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.480]   Well, it's on our backs.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:46.720]   That if someone like him, right, if a talent like Nick
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:51.520]   can come up with a new concept of reality TV, let's say,
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.200]   and celebrity TV, and the new TMZ TV
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.320]   doesn't appear on our channel.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.600]   It appears here because he loves the independence of it.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:00.280]   That he could make something good enough for TV.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.360]   But he's going to make it cheap.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:02.360]   He's going to make it different.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.360]   He's going to make it for TV.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.280]   And it's going to work as a business, just like Trit.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:10.560]   Trit is not going to be as big as CNN was.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:12.720]   But Trit's profitable, right, Leo?
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:17.680]   Oh, but yeah, but it's a dinky compared to--
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.800]   But that's the new future.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.200]   The effort to make blockbusters will always be possible,
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.520]   but they will become ever and ever and ever harder to make.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.120]   And because of the internet, cheap internet distribution
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.080]   and cheap means of production, you
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:40.280]   could see a lot of small, profitable little fishies in the sea.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.000]   So what does Google do back to your question now?
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.120]   What does Google do about Google TV?
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.720]   Well, I'm a little worried.
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.800]   Just by the way, the boxy box is like any minute now.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.080]   In fact, I would just check the Amazon.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.480]   It's set in stock.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.600]   So it's not just Google TV.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.920]   It's a lot of devices.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.480]   Maybe the boxy box will be the one.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.000]   I don't know.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.280]   But what's clear is the content providers
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.480]   have made a very big distinction between watching
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:07.840]   a show over the internet on a computer versus watching
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.260]   a show on the internet on a television.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.240]   It seems to me an arbitrary distinction.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.520]   Oh, it's completely arbitrary.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.720]   And kind of nutty.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.120]   They haven't-- for whatever reason,
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:22.800]   the content providers for video haven't been that inclined.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.880]   I think a lot of it is they watched music get really steep.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.640]   They watched Apple take a chunk out of music,
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:33.200]   and they're really afraid to let that go.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.120]   Yes, of course.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.600]   Because it's also a joy you're right,
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.560]   because it's ad supported, which is Google's whole business.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.120]   Right.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.220]   And I mean, but what I think--
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.300]   you're almost--
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:44.380]   Jeff, I think you're almost on something
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:45.820]   where I feel like a lot of the missing piece--
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.580]   But usually where I am in life.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:49.740]   On to something.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:50.540]   On to something.
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:51.540]   On to something.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:52.540]   Almost.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.700]   Oh, stop waiting.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.700]   Go ahead.
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.100]   It's all about content, I think, ultimately.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.780]   And it's about things that people want to watch.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:01.420]   Well, we want it to be all about content.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:01.920]   Absolutely.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.180]   Well, I think it is, though.
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:06.860]   But I think it's about the amount of money it still makes--
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.320]   it takes to create the kind of content we want to watch.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.760]   Like, that's going down.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.680]   That's those blockbusters you're talking about.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.640]   It's not going down in certain ways.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.880]   Like, I think the middle is going away.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:19.440]   And expensive things are more expensive,
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:20.720]   and cheap things are cheaper.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.280]   But here's the risk.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.000]   Here's the risk.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   And I think that this is a very real risk,
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.560]   although others don't.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:30.800]   That if you do things like Block Gina for all of this stuff
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.840]   that she wants to watch, she's just
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.720]   going to go to BitTorrent.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:38.260]   The real risk is this--
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:40.260]   this is what the music industry realized
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.980]   is if you don't make it digitally available legally,
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:44.720]   people will get it illegally.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.980]   So that's when they finally came around and said, all right,
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:48.840]   well, we better-- everybody but the Beatles.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.300]   We better sell it on iTunes, because otherwise, people
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.900]   are going to see Robesplyne.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:56.940]   And they gave up on these backhanded measures
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:59.740]   to preserve it by lawsuit and prosecution.
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.260]   And they said, all right, we give up.
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.340]   We're going to sell it digitally.
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.780]   I think they've got to do this.
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:08.880]   And it's not that the business model, blah, blah, blah.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.760]   It's going to come down fundamentally.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.400]   People are just going to steal it from you.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.000]   If you don't do it, they're going to steal it.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.080]   If I want to watch a sci-fi TV show
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:21.320]   and I don't get it on my Google TV, I always have BitTorrent.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.960]   But I wonder how much of the--
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.600]   I don't think they're losing as much to piracy.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.060]   I certainly don't think they're losing as much
[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:28.560]   to piracy as they always claim to be losing.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:30.080]   But they will increasingly.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.760]   But I think that maybe--
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:35.020]   I think more, they're just losing possible sales.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.100]   They're losing the opportunity.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.220]   It's an opportunity cost.
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.500]   OK, but it's still a significant opportunity cost.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.420]   If you're talking about Comcast, we're
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.420]   talking about the people that are actually distributing
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.300]   a lot of this content and a lot of the channels,
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.260]   they're still making money hand over fist.
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:50.500]   So they're not in a situation where
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.760]   the initial borderline profits--
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:57.100]   I mean, Hulu just had what, a $250 million revenue quarter,
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:57.580]   I want to say?
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.900]   Maybe it was a year.
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.060]   That's good.
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.720]   But that's chump change for a big media company to have.
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.720]   No, in fact, the media company see it as incremental value.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.320]   They don't see it.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.200]   They see it as-- we already made the show.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.960]   We'll let the kids watch it on their computers.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.280]   But they damn well better not watch it on their TVs,
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.080]   because that's where we're making the money.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.640]   But that's what's going to--
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.680]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.100]   All I'm saying is that I think there's something that hasn't
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.120]   quite been done yet, which is to make something that
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.640]   is a cultural--
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:29.080]   has the cultural impact of Mad Men or a Sopranos or something
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.500]   that I keep thinking that.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.660]   I keep thinking-- and I think--
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:35.420]   I want to do an audio because it's so cheap to do audio.
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:38.660]   I think there's got to be a Matthew Wiener out there who
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:44.380]   can't get on HBO or AMC and says, what if I just did--
[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:47.580]   not even a video version, but an audio version of this?
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.060]   I'm waiting for the--
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:52.460]   if somebody did "The Wire" on audio,
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.580]   and it was so compelling that you had to listen to the next week
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.740]   and the week after that, something like that
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:00.040]   could tumble-- do we acknowledge it's a house of cards
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.840]   and it could be tumbled if somebody would just come along
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.200]   and tumble it?
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.520]   If it's a motive to own it, and it gets the key,
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.840]   is it Howard Stern talked--
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.080]   has been talked about this now--
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.760]   That's what's going to happen.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.000]   But he wants to own it.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.800]   When the creatives finally say, I give up
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.640]   on these Fakotka networks, they haven't had a choice.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.320]   They don't realize yet that they have a choice.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.360]   So they're just doing it the way they've done it all along.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.520]   They're going to Hollywood with their script in their hand.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.120]   But they don't have to do that anymore
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:28.180]   when they start realizing that, eliminate the middle man.
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:30.020]   They go direct to their audience.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:31.940]   I think that they could change the world.
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:33.740]   Leo, did you see the commuter, the movie
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.420]   made entirely on the Nokia N8?
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:36.420]   No.
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:37.500]   Awesome.
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:38.140]   I sent you the link.
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:39.460]   All right, let me see it.
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:41.420]   On Google Docs, Gary.
[00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:42.420]   Skype.
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:42.920]   Skype.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.700]   OK, I will never get to see it because you're there.
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:47.100]   Oh, I see.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.900]   I can't somehow make that--
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:50.460]   I mean, I can get rid of you and play it.
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:51.460]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:54.220]   I feel like we need more Joss Whedon's making that crossover.
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:57.280]   And also, I would love to see Howard make that shift.
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:02.520]   And then younger filmmakers can emulate that as well.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.720]   This is why it takes 15 years.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.280]   Joel is because it takes a generation that
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.280]   doesn't have it in their head that you go to Hollywood
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.880]   with your script and you beg and plead and say,
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.640]   can you please green light my deal?
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.640]   It's not about money.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.080]   I think it's about habit.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:16.580]   And--
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.480]   It's a lot about money, though, too.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.640]   Even if you have a huge success on the internet,
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.440]   and you produce using all the opportunity that technology
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.860]   gives you, there's still a lot more money
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.800]   if you grow in Hollywood.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.980]   Yeah, I understand.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.420]   But I think creatives are not driven by money.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.720]   They're driven by control.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.120]   They're driven by a lot of things.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.720]   And I think that you're going to see a new generation that
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.600]   says, first of all, that doesn't have the expectation.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.960]   If you're a rock and roll band and you look and say, geez,
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.760]   I want to do as well as Aerosmith and AC/DC did,
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.600]   I want a triple platinum album.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.360]   Those days are going away.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.800]   And I think musicians are going to rapidly come to the conclusion.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.040]   I just like to make a living.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.560]   And I think that you're going to get to that point as well.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.880]   With content creators, people want--
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.880]   it's not just money.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.200]   It's control.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:01.880]   It's--
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.440]   It's a relationship to the audience.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:03.940]   It's--
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.040]   There's other stuff.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:05.640]   --and other stuff.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.400]   Yeah, and I think Howard's a very good example.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.400]   Now you got to have $1 billion.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.720]   I'm serious.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.880]   I mean, here was that part.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.040]   What's control?
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.400]   But go look at the bottom of the Google Doc.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.120]   I will click this.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.880]   This is the N8.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.000]   So now-- but they're not-- this is on YouTube.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.240]   They're not releasing this in any way.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:22.600]   No, no, no.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.000]   This was to demonstrate the possibility.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.120]   And obviously, we know that you can do a cheap camera.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.840]   But it still says that you can do it amazing.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.760]   They put it on a nice holder and it looks pretty cool.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.440]   Well, I'm seeing really good high quality Hollywood
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.720]   quality stuff done on DSLRs.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.160]   We shoot everything with DSLRs now.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.000]   And they are amazing.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.600]   Why buy a camcorder?
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.520]   You'd be nuts to buy a camcorder.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.640]   I mean, you still want writers and talent and all that stuff.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.520]   That's where expense comes in.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.560]   But you're not paying gaffers to sit on their ass.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.480]   Gaffers to sit on your affers.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.560]   So the commuter-- let me see here.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.960]   Let me get the highest quality.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:59.360]   This is from Nokia UK on YouTube.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.640]   Only 379,000 views, which is kind of in-- how long has this
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.960]   been around?
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.760]   Not that long.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.160]   So this is shot on an N8 camera phone.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:09.660]   Yep.
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:10.120]   The whole thing.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.000]   Wow, looks good.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.720]   Yeah, the N8 has a pretty good image.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.760]   It's probably 720p, right?
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:17.320]   I think so.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.200]   Oops, I'm sorry.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.960]   You're not seeing anything.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.080]   What we pushed the button--
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.720]   We're seeing it at the ad for square place.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.080]   Yeah, that's what you're seeing.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.040]   You see it in my ad copy.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.960]   So this looks pretty good.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.440]   Aussie.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:30.760]   It's OK.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.320]   It's just a movie, Aussie.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.200]   Well, that's the point.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.080]   Is that the means of production and distribution
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.240]   are virtually free or very low cost.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.040]   But creatives are-- you know, talent is what's valuable.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:43.480]   Well, I actually--
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.240]   Somebody write an edit, you know?
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.000]   The thing that I feel like Google to bring it back to this,
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.840]   because this was actually where I had initially
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.200]   meant to go, is I never quite understood
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.320]   why Google doesn't fund some content.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.440]   Well, they're doing a journalism.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.080]   Right?
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:00.480]   Why?
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.400]   Here's why.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.160]   Because they'll find themselves in the exact same pickle
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.000]   they were in with Google Books.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.800]   They're in channel conflict.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.160]   And--
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.080]   By the way, they'll go into the way--
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.480]   --cused to point into their own stuff
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.760]   at the expense of others.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.840]   And then you're going to find that that becomes an antitrust
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.200]   issue.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.600]   By the way, that guy in the star of the NA movie,
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.400]   you know who that is?
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.480]   Yeah, he looks familiar.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.680]   Yeah, slum dog millionaire.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.400]   Oh, right.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.800]   Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.360]   Eileen Rivera just told me.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.120]   The commuter.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.000]   You know, obviously, Nokia probably
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:36.920]   spent a lot of money.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:41.240]   Millions on him and the director and the writer and the shooters.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.360]   But I know, I think that those talents
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.560]   aren't restricted.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.560]   There's got to be a whole generation growing up
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.400]   with these skills.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.280]   And you get rid of the middlemen
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.760]   and you don't go through the sieve that is Hollywood.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.840]   Yeah, you're not building a big house for some guy who
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.800]   made the deal.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.120]   So you get a little more, right?
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.000]   Look at this, Leo.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.200]   I'm on TV.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.200]   That's you.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.680]   He's on-- I'm on TV.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.680]   You get the thing you taste.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:07.720]   Don't be here.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.160]   I'm on TV, Ma.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.840]   I think it's-- I think we're-- you know,
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.680]   this is why it takes a long time.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.560]   It's not that the technology takes a long time.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:16.880]   Old habits die hard.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.280]   It took more-- it took almost 100 years
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.840]   after the invention of movable type for anybody
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.320]   to do anything but print more Bibles.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.400]   But after a while, people said, oh, you know,
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.360]   and novels and plays and the reformation happened,
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.560]   it just takes a little while.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.840]   Now, I think it's happening faster with the internet
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.000]   than in 80 years.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:35.840]   But it's still a big time.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.680]   But it just--
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:39.600]   I realized I wrote this syllabus for my class
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.920]   in new business models for our new MA degree
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.600]   in entrepreneurial journalism.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.840]   And I realized that what I have to teach is disruption.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.560]   That's right.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.600]   That's the lesson.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:55.800]   And so I'm going to have the students take on a week
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.520]   underbelly of something in the old media
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.960]   and do a plan of how to disrupt it.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.080]   You know what's interesting is I sitting here
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.880]   on this new media approach, which is essentially a--
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.080]   A ball, a big ball.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.880]   --an automated, inflated ball.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:14.520]   And I realized that I'm only here for a few years,
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.720]   and then somebody's going to come along
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.840]   and disintermediate me.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.760]   That's fine.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.200]   You know, I think that that's exciting.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.720]   You want to live in a time where these things kind of get
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.320]   tossed up and disrupted, and that's good.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.240]   And I think it will get disrupted.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.080]   I think you're right, Jeff, that Google's role
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.320]   is not as a disruptor.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.040]   And they probably are smart enough to think,
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.400]   we can just sit back.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.360]   We're just providing the pipes, providing the means,
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.320]   providing the search.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.880]   I want to talk about they're doing something interesting
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.720]   with YouTube, though.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.200]   We're going to talk about that.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.600]   Something called topics.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.520]   But before we get there, I would like
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.920]   to talk a little bit about Squarespace.com, which
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.880]   is a tool for disruption as well, a way you can create a website.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:58.560]   Look, the other day I was looking for a business,
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.600]   it didn't have a website.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.040]   And I said, you know, I don't go--
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:02.960]   What are you--
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.040]   Huh?
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.920]   Do you think a business these days can
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.360]   survive without a website?
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.280]   And maybe you're scared off and say, well, I'm not
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:10.920]   going to do a website.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.720]   I don't know anything about it.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.120]   And I can't figure out how to find a designer
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.640]   and go to squarespace.com.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.040]   They start with these 60 great templates.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.640]   You can customize without knowing anything about design
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.080]   and get a great site.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.240]   If you go to the examples page here,
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.640]   you can see featured sites, blogs, design, and art.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.760]   But there's also e-commerce.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.520]   There's restaurants.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.360]   There's wineries.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.760]   There's plumbers.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.560]   It's all here.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.520]   Anything that-- look, this is exercise equipment.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.480]   These guys, this is a big business.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.240]   They created a website very easily on squarespace.com.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.600]   Now, they get some real advantages here.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.840]   First of all, all the hosting, all the technical stuff,
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.840]   is done by Squarespace.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.080]   All the updates, you don't have to worry about security ever
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.920]   because your software is always up to date.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.720]   Squarespace takes care of that.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.520]   All the bandwidth is always there.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.120]   You never run out of bandwidth on squarespace.com.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.360]   They have very sophisticated Java-based VPS solution
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.480]   that-- I don't have to get technical on you,
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.960]   but really, you cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.800]   Here's a lot of restaurants who use Squarespace.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.040]   If you have a small business and you
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.320]   don't have a presence on the internet,
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.040]   I can't imagine you're listening to this show.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.520]   But maybe you know somebody.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.880]   I think the people who listen to this show
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.040]   are the kind of people that businesses come to and say,
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:25.720]   I need a website.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.800]   What do I do?
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.000]   Just tell them squarespace.com.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.480]   In fact, tell them squarespace.com/twig.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.400]   They can click the try it free button.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.040]   You know what?
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.920]   Alex Lindsey was in a restaurant the other day.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.560]   They didn't have a website.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.320]   Before he left the restaurant, he whipped out his laptop.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:46.040]   He set up a site.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.160]   There's no credit card or anything.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:47.760]   You just set it up.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.360]   And you've got it.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.200]   And he literally put together a site using their templates
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.960]   and said here, if you want it, I'll transfer it over to you.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.880]   Here's the password.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.520]   It's yours.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.760]   That's the kind of thing.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.760]   I mean, and it starts at $12 a month for hosting
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.760]   and all the software, everything you need.
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.600]   If you do use the promo code twig,
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.040]   you'll save 10% a month for the rest of your site,
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.400]   the life of your site forever, basically.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.120]   So do use that promo code twig when you set it up.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.320]   This is just a great solution.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.760]   Things like we use-- on our inside Twit blog,
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:22.880]   we use a squarespace iPhone app, not merely to post,
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:27.000]   but also to moderate comments and view site stats.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.360]   It's really great to make sure you
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.040]   don't have spam in your comments, that kind of thing.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.280]   That's just fantastic.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.440]   squarespace.com/twig, try it free for 15 days.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.960]   You can even import your existing site
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.760]   if you have one movable type wordpress type
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.240]   adder, blogger APIs are supported.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:44.320]   And then if you decide to buy, use the offer code twig.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.720]   And you'll save big every single month, 10% a month.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.160]   I love squarespace.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.640]   Lots of friends using it.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.200]   We use it for our blog.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.920]   It's just fantastic.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.240]   So interesting move, Google's going to add--
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.200]   now, one of the things that Google does right now
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.600]   when you go to YouTube, you watch a video,
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.040]   you get related videos.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.280]   And actually, I think that's a bone of contention,
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.280]   because if you're a content--
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.400]   like, I'm a content creator.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.920]   Sometimes those related videos, I really
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.720]   don't want them to show up.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.200]   You can't turn them off.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.560]   Or they're inappropriate.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.680]   Now they're going to do something called topics.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.080]   I haven't seen these yet, but apparently,
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.400]   they're starting to appear on YouTube.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.240]   Tonight, they see Net reported.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.640]   It's supposed to show up in Test 2, which is there like--
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.000]   Oh, you have to go to Test 2.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:27.360]   OK.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.480]   Yeah, they're labs area.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.640]   And I'm not seeing it in mine right now.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.640]   But yeah, no, these topics are basically going to be--
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.560]   they're going to look like tags, but they're more than that.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.160]   I've seen that-- this is Tom Krazit writing for a CNET
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.120]   said that they're the practice sophisticated analysis
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.520]   of comments, viewing patterns, and other signals that
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.800]   will automatically appear above videos.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.480]   So it's kind of like related videos, but better.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.360]   Right.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:52.640]   Right.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.440]   That sounds like that's the goal.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.000]   So if you search for Lady Gaga, the screenshot here,
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.040]   you'll get kind of explore.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.240]   You'll see Justin Bieber, poker face, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry,
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.640]   kind of related videos that you might be interested in.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.160]   That's one of the problems I have.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.280]   Even I'm even looking at my recommendations on YouTube.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.080]   And one of them is my own video.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.480]   White Tiger wants to play.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.520]   I don't know why that's recommended.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.440]   Some of it makes sense.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.720]   Some of it makes no sense at all.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.280]   And I think that they could do a much better job.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.160]   I know that's a hard thing.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.560]   Recommendations are a hard thing to do.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.200]   But topics might be the solution.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.080]   Just give me some keywords, and I can drill deeper.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:32.280]   They just need to recommend cute cat videos to everyone.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.280]   Oh, you all get the same stupid recommendations?
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.960]   Do you think they're paying for that?
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.200]   No, I'm asking you, would you pay Leo to control
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.440]   some of that recommendation space?
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.000]   Oh.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.680]   Oh, I didn't even think of that.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.080]   Of course, you put those topic words,
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.800]   and then one of them is sponsored.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.640]   Right.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:54.800]   Boy, those Google guys is always thinking.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.640]   Did we mention the Google Maps border dispute?
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.320]   Or was that on Twitter?
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.040]   We talked about that.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:10:59.520]   We haven't been out.
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.960]   We haven't been out.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.360]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.520]   But latest now, the Nicaragua Embassy in London
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.520]   says the government of Nicaragua has formally
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.760]   requested Google not to accept the formal petition
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.640]   of the government of Costa Rica to modify the border demarcation.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.000]   To see, apparently, a Costa Rican general
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.800]   used the Google Maps to justify invading Nicaragua,
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.600]   saying, no, no, that's our territory.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:25.280]   Google says, we got the data from the US government.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.280]   Go complain to them.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:33.080]   That's just what happens when you make maps.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.160]   Google did post.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.200]   Did they say who actually-- is this actually Google's map,
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.480]   or is this something they bought from the other--
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.040]   It's from the State Department.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.200]   Oh, that's funny.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:46.320]   But if you go to Bing Maps, by the way,
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.120]   you get a different interpretation of where the border is.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:54.080]   That is the best fanboy war that I've ever seen.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.360]   If you're a Microsoft fanboy, then you are on this side
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.080]   of the border.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:58.600]   Right.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.640]   If you're a Google fanboy, you're with guns over here.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.280]   Yesterday, we became aware of a dispute
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.560]   that referenced the border between Costa Rica and Nicaragua
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.080]   as depicted on Google Maps.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.240]   This morning, after a discussion with the data supplier
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.880]   for this particular border at the US Department of State,
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.080]   we determined there was indeed an error by up to 2.7 kilometers.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:21.000]   The State Department gave them the corrected version,
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.400]   and they're going to fix it.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.720]   So Bing had it right.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.360]   And by the way, the Google posting
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:30.720]   then refers to President Grover Cleveland
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.200]   and the 1888 arbitration agreement.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:39.040]   And this drawing, which is apparently on a notebook
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.000]   with lined paper.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.600]   Wow.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.800]   From 1888.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.080]   I guess you see another world.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.240]   You know, it's a complicated place.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.080]   You get in the map business.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.440]   You never know what you're going to find out.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.240]   There's a new AdSense interface.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.120]   Do we care?
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.920]   [GROANING]
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.840]   Have you looked at it, Jeff?
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:01.760]   I haven't looked at it.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.040]   I haven't looked at it.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.440]   I don't use AdSense, you think?
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.400]   No.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.960]   Actually, I used to, but no, I don't use it lately.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.840]   I think I have $2 in an AdSense account somewhere.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:12.560]   I know.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.600]   Everyone's talking to this email that'll be like,
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:15.680]   really, we want to pay you.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.520]   And I'm like, I--
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.640]   But we don't want to send a check,
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.200]   because that costs us $5.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.280]   Right.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.960]   Would you like stamps?
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.960]   The new interface is full of features that make him--
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.400]   just, you know, if you're an AdSense user, go check it out.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.440]   There's a nice video.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.320]   Yeah, just go check that out.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.280]   Go check it out.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.760]   We'll give you the news.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.320]   I got some news here.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.520]   We report you go check it out.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:40.720]   Do we say this already?
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.840]   Google said, apparently, the guy who broke the bonus memo
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.400]   was fired.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.120]   Oh, dear.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.800]   Oh.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.680]   CNN Money says, after the money, the memo
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.560]   was leaked to Business Insider, which broke the news.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.120]   Within hours, Google notified staff
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.600]   and had terminated the leaker.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.040]   How'd they find out?
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.040]   I don't know.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.120]   You wonder if everybody had a different amount.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.160]   We're giving the bonus of $9,000, $9,000.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.080]   No, it's $1,000.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.280]   That gets sticky.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:08.720]   Yeah, I was going to find out.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.880]   Or yellow dots on the printout.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.040]   I hope they didn't snoop on the Gmail.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.040]   That would be very wrong.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.440]   That's probably what they did.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:15.960]   Sure.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.080]   They'd be nothing wrong if they're snooping on their corporate--
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.320]   Completely legal to do that.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.320]   I know, but it is legal.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.280]   But it's as they say at Google, creepy.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.200]   Well, we got to protect ourselves.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:33.080]   So what's your take on this frickah between Facebook
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:33.720]   and Google?
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.400]   Google?
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.400]   Facebook--
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.960]   I was hoping you'd tell us that.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:41.800]   Well, Facebook's attitude is we import everything,
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.320]   but we don't give you anything.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.120]   And in some degree, you can defend that.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.600]   We've all been hard on Facebook over privacy.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.320]   Facebook's saying, well, look, we have an agreement
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.800]   to keep this stuff private.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.360]   So for conveniences, we're going to allow you, for instance,
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.080]   on Facebook.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.720]   When you say, find friends on Facebook,
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.120]   give me your Gmail thing.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.360]   I'll look at your Gmail, and I'll find some friends on there.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.440]   And Google just cut that off saying, well, wait a minute.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.560]   It's not reciprocal.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.920]   We want to be able to do the same thing with Facebook.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.520]   But I understand Facebook's point of view
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.080]   is, well, we said it would be private.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.640]   We can't just let you have it.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.120]   Yeah, but I can say whether or not
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:17.280]   I want my friends to have access to my email address.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.760]   So if I say Leo, when you and I are friends,
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.920]   you can see my email address.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.680]   Then I'm OK with you having access
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.040]   that address on your Facebook widget on your phone
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.720]   or being able to export it.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.920]   I mean, that's my contact information.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.280]   It's like giving a business card.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.520]   This whole thing got really ugly.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.720]   I didn't like the way either Facebook or Google
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:35.720]   handled it.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.720]   I'll be honest.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.720]   It's a little sniping, right?
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:38.720]   Yeah, I did.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.720]   It's a really snarky.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.120]   I understand Google's point.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.960]   I mean, they're kind of taking this very--
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.640]   like this is common open source culture,
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.600]   this like share alike kind of thing.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.240]   Hey, you know what?
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:51.400]   Our date is not available to you if you can't spit it back out.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.920]   But then, you know, so they took away access to the API
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.440]   so that Facebook just linked directly to their export page.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.120]   And then Google put up this page that the header was called
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.920]   Track My Context Now.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:02.520]   Hold on.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.680]   This is what Google will give you when you use this Facebook
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.040]   feature to export contacts or import contacts from Gmail.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.600]   Hold on a second, says Google.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.840]   Hold on.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:15.960]   Are you super sure you want to import your contact information
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.520]   for your friends into a service that won't let you get it out?
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.840]   Here's the not so fine print.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.720]   I think Eric Schmidt should read this in his creepy voice.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.640]   You've been directed to this page from a site that doesn't
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.800]   allow you to re-export your data other services, essentially
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:35.640]   locking up your contact data about your friends.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.760]   Doesn't this whole thing read like it was just written
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.560]   by like some random engineer who was just really pissed
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.200]   about the whole thing?
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.280]   Yeah, because it's kind of opaque.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.120]   It's hard to understand.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.080]   So once you import your data there,
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.080]   you won't be able to get it out.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.800]   We think this is an important thing for you to know before you
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.200]   import your data there.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.800]   See this bad writing?
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:50.800]   Jackass.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:54.640]   Fool.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.840]   I painted a fool.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.560]   We strongly disagree with his data protectionism.
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.480]   The choice is yours.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.440]   Google doesn't have their data.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.920]   Google has my data.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.160]   So if I tell them to give it to somebody else,
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.480]   I appreciate this thing using it.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.240]   But it's like-- and I feel the same way about Facebook.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:11.880]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:14.360]   They should give me back my data if I ask for it.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.760]   But for Google to kind of act like, oh, we're
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.320]   being the nice ones about it.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.560]   And Facebook's evil is disingenuous.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.960]   Well then, look, it says this public service announcement
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.440]   is brought to you on behalf of your friends at Google Contacts.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.200]   And then there's a checkbox.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.440]   I want to be able to export my data from Facebook.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.560]   Please register a complaint on my behalf
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.600]   over data protectionism.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.080]   Like Google's going to send them--
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.640]   What's the whole thing now though?
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.280]   How does this fit into the fact that you're
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.640]   supposed to be able to export your Facebook stuff?
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.840]   Well, basically Google kind of--
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:45.880]   I think I'm--
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.800]   Gina, correct me.
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.000]   Google basically back down, but gives you this message.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:49.500]   Right.
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.320]   They give you this message.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.320]   So you can continue to do it, but they give you this message.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:56.480]   So they've got this anti-Facebook rhetoric going on.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.640]   Where Joel's point is exactly right.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.960]   If I'm saying, get my contacts from Gmail
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.840]   and put it in a Facebook, I know what I'm doing.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.840]   That's what I want to do.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.240]   It is my data.
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.040]   So Facebook is not--
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.040]   I think it's a pretty important distinction.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:07.680]   If you have--
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.280]   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.360]   But whenever a company gives you a warning message,
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.880]   that's super important that they are objective
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.960]   about how they're presenting.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.000]   That's not the time to be political.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.400]   That's the time to say, here is the situation.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.000]   And not have some--
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.640]   But if you're in New York market and you
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.040]   heard cable vision and Fox go after each other--
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:30.540]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.040]   That's nothing.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:31.800]   There is the devil.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.800]   No, there is the devil.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.040]   No, they're helping you.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.840]   They're both the devil.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.320]   The only official-- according to a gig--
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.520]   on the only official comment that's
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.240]   emerged from Facebook, platform engineer Mike Vernal
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.120]   suggested that Google is being hypocritical about data
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.880]   portability and is only concerned about it
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.720]   because Facebook's more popular--
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:50.560]   I mean--
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.040]   You're only--
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.040]   She's more popular.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.640]   I mean, this is a video.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.840]   This is so childish, on either end.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.760]   And I just feel like you're treating your customers
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:00.720]   like they're idiots.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.240]   If I'm asking to go in a Facebook, then I-- yeah,
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.760]   so I'm asking to get my contacts in a Facebook.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.360]   And you know what?
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.520]   Then I have a copy of my contacts on Google servers
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.360]   and on Facebook servers.
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.640]   And I have access to it either way.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.200]   I mean, I'm not being hoodwinked at this--
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.720]   They're my freaking contacts.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.360]   Yeah, and these are just two companies sniping at one another.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.880]   I wasn't a fan.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.680]   I kind of expected this kind of thing from Facebook.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.840]   I didn't really expect it from Google.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.840]   I really--
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.840]   It's a big problem for Google.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:27.480]   They have this institutional, I think, blindness that they--
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.520]   they think all their users think about them the way
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.800]   they think about themselves.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.920]   And that's why you have Schmidt saying all this super easy stuff.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.160]   It's not just Google.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.600]   It's Facebook does exactly the same thing.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.080]   True.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:38.560]   True.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.160]   It's-- it's this-- there's a trend in Silicon Valley
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.280]   towards this-- this really caddy sniping.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.200]   We've seen this in the last couple of years with Jobs,
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.400]   Google, Facebook.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.520]   And then there's this other trend, which you nailed, Joel,
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:53.640]   which is, well, you're all just like us.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.080]   And I really like what you said.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.480]   This is my data.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.000]   That's the bottom line.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.120]   Google, you may hold it, but where'd you get it?
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:01.360]   Right.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.120]   I understand that that's-- my data is
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:07.000]   what I've traded for the services that Google provides.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.720]   But this doesn't become your property now.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:09.400]   Right.
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:13.400]   But if it comes down to who owns my personal data, me
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.840]   or the service I'm using, it's--
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.680]   I guess you could argue it either way,
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.040]   but I don't feel that way personally.
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:21.400]   All right.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.600]   I want to take a little break, and we're
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.080]   going to come back with more.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:24.600]   This is fun.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.520]   Joel Johnson is here.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.800]   He's from gizmodo.com.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.280]   You said it exactly right, too.
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.000]   Gizmodo.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:31.720]   Is that--
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.880]   That's how we all say it internally.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:34.880]   You go to a party.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:35.960]   That's the password.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:36.760]   Where do you work?
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.760]   Gizmodo.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:41.040]   Also, Jeff.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:41.600]   Did you know a surprise?
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.240]   No surprise.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.640]   Jeff Jarvis from Buzz Machine and Genius Turopani
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.200]   from Smartairware.org.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.720]   I have a phrase for all of you.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.280]   I also want to talk about Ford.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.520]   Ford.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.440]   I don't know how they say that.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:55.640]   Ford.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:56.160]   You know what they say?
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.360]   They call it the Blue Oval.
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.360]   I kind of like that.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:01.040]   Scott Mani, who is their Twitter guy, their social media
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.960]   guy, says, we're polishing the Blue Oval,
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.920]   because that's the logo.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.760]   It's really fun to see the old Ford logos.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:10.240]   We went to the Rouge plan in Dearborn.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.920]   We had a filter, but it was so much fun.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.840]   And to see the original Ford logo is almost identical.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:20.240]   The logo with Henry Ford and the Model A, it's almost the same.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.960]   The Rouge plant was built in the '20s by Henry Ford,
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.080]   who had this great vision.
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.080]   He wanted to build a plant.
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.120]   It's like a mile by a mile and a half.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.600]   It's huge that you put in raw materials.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.160]   The box cars come up with Coke, not Coca-Cola,
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:37.480]   but like iron ore and lumber.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.840]   And the other end comes a car.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.200]   The Model T's were the first cars,
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.040]   but we saw the F-150 trucks being made.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:46.920]   It's just really fun to see.
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.720]   In fact, you can go on a tour of the Rouge plant
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.680]   if you're there.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.120]   Highly recommended.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.520]   Highly recommended.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.760]   It's a mile and three quarters long and a half a mile wide.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.240]   That's the actual dimensions.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.320]   With the factory we were in, the F-150 factory
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:02.480]   has a green rooftop.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.320]   It's a growing rooftop.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.720]   It's got a succulent on it, which
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:06.480]   does a couple of things.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:08.440]   It keeps it cooler in the summer.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:11.880]   It absorbs runoff water so they can reuse the water,
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.920]   reduces energy costs.
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:18.320]   And of course, it sucks in CO2 and generates oxygen.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.320]   Quite a bit of it because it's acres.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.080]   Really neat.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:24.160]   You might want to take a look at some of the new Ford vehicles.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.360]   The Fiesta is fantastic.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:26.840]   40 highway miles per gallon.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.840]   That's the most fuel efficiency of any compact car out there.
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:33.240]   The EcoBoost V6 engine and the Taurus SHO.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.320]   Amazing engine.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.680]   It's 6,365 horsepower.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.080]   Very economical.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.720]   Basically, the power of V8 in a V6 engine
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:44.080]   with direct fuel injection.
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:47.680]   The 2011 Fiesta, I mentioned that.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.960]   40 continues to innovate, and I'm really proud.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.800]   A Ford continues to bring heavy industry,
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.360]   keep it alive in the United States,
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.720]   keep the jobs in the United States,
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.600]   keep the innovation in the United States.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.760]   And I love that Ford sink.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:22:59.560]   You know that.
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:03.640]   Check out the new Taurus SHO, the new Ford Fiesta,
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.880]   the new Ford Edge.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.240]   They got some great cars.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.160]   And of course, the new 5.0 Mustang,
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.640]   which is what I desperately want.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.000]   It's all at your Ford dealer.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:13.920]   Check it out today.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.680]   Drive one this week.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.280]   And thank you, Ford, for us.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.920]   They've been giving such support to the TWIT network.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.560]   In fact, well, I won't say anything else.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.000]   We've got some things coming up.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.960]   I'm really excited about it.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.840]   Instant previews in search.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.400]   People are getting all excited about this.
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.120]   This is the, you could do this before
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.720]   with a Firefox plug-in.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.560]   Gina, what happens when I go,
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.760]   is this in the, in Chrome only or where?
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.000]   - I think it's everywhere.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:41.840]   - Do a search.
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.840]   Actually, I haven't tried it in Firefox
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.240]   because I've only been using Chrome,
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.080]   but I believe it's everywhere.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:48.600]   In your search results, there's a little magnifying glass
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.680]   at the very end after the blue link.
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.560]   And if you click on it, you can see a preview of whoa.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.040]   - I don't know who that was.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.600]   That wasn't Gina.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:57.600]   - That was not me.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.440]   - Okay.
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.560]   And so when I get there, there's this little magnifying glass.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.400]   I click it.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.160]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.000]   You don't even have to click it.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:05.920]   You could hover over it.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:06.760]   No, you could see after a quick.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.920]   - Well, you click it to see it.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.040]   You can also use the right arrow key.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.240]   So the down and right arrow key to expand the--
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.840]   - So neat.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:14.880]   - Yeah, the page.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:15.720]   - And it's pretty--
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:16.560]   - And it even highlights the page.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.400]   See, look at that.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.080]   - It highlights the portions of text on the page
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.480]   that have the keywords you search for.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.760]   - And it gives you a call out.
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:25.600]   - It's funny.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.120]   - You know, it's funny, whenever I've used
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:29.360]   a lot of Firefox extensions that do this kind of thing
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.440]   in the past, and I always felt like they were kind
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.480]   of like a little bloaty and would just load
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.200]   this giant image.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.200]   But this implementation is pretty good.
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.560]   I've been kind of interested.
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.600]   It's been interesting to see Google kind of move away.
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.040]   They used to be so militant about this bare bone
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.200]   set of results, you know?
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.240]   But they've been really loosening up those.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.880]   - By by notice of--
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:48.720]   - Yeah, I mean--
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:49.880]   - Oh, you think it's just--
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.200]   - 'Cause Marissa's not there?
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.840]   - Yeah, I don't think so, but--
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.080]   - Yeah, they're not like gossipy.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.120]   - They've been more liberal about adding little images
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.160]   and changing things around.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.840]   I mean, that's a pretty heavy image to load.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:01.680]   But they're not--
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.520]   - I'm not seeing it.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:03.920]   Is it enough that you--
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.160]   I know the idea is that if you don't want to go
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.360]   to the site, you won't now.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.720]   But is it enough to not go to a site you want to go to?
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.960]   - No, look at, if you look on our shot now,
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.920]   you see, it's just, it's very tiny.
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.520]   It really is more like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.040]   I've seen that USGS site, I remember that.
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.400]   You still want to click on it.
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.000]   But I got to say, it's prefetching and caching,
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.280]   I would imagine these pages.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.920]   So it is adding to the overall page load.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:30.440]   In fact, Gina Donai, woodengeography.com,
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:33.880]   when I hover my mouse over, it wouldn't,
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.480]   that sense a load, even though it didn't really get loaded.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.080]   I mean, isn't that--
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.280]   - It's probably caching something
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:43.120]   when this fighters are walking through, I would think.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.560]   - Yeah, it's taking a snapshot.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.440]   Because if you look at blogs,
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.200]   it'll build their kind of like an older snapshot.
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:48.560]   - Okay, okay.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.080]   So it's not really even for media people to go in.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:52.840]   - And it looks like, I mean, this is interesting.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:55.080]   They really are doing a treatment to this
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.840]   because here it is geography.com,
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:59.600]   and it's a call out that says,
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.880]   geography is the science of our world.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.960]   I mean, you can read that.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.200]   So they're doing some sort of,
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.840]   yeah, there is something going on with this.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:09.080]   It's more than just an image.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.560]   Wow, that's really interesting.
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.960]   So you think Rupert Murdoch,
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.040]   how do you think he's gonna react to this, Jeff?
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.200]   - Ah, he's gonna complain.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.040]   - Yeah.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.440]   - But actually he took his stuff down anyway.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:18.280]   - So that's right.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.760]   He's not a, is he not on Google?
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.320]   - He's on Google News.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.920]   He took his stuff out of Google News.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:24.840]   - Okay.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.880]   - That's not enough about Google search.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.320]   I bet he's still there.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.760]   - God.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.720]   - The screenshots do not include the ads.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:34.680]   - Anything with a plugin shows up as a little puzzle piece.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:35.520]   - That's good.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.680]   - But yeah, it just seems like an easy way to recognize it.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:39.680]   Oh yeah, I know that page.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:40.600]   That's the page I'm looking for.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.480]   - So here's my website.
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:42.560]   Let's see.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.760]   Yeah, the big puzzle piece there.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.680]   Oh yeah, this is old 'cause it has the Halloween banner.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.000]   - Yeah, so these are cash snapshots.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.520]   - Yeah.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.520]   - I can imagine what kind of storage this was.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.520]   - Good Lord.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.160]   You know, Google just blows my mind.
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.640]   But they have to store a little bit of it anyway
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:02.280]   for their search.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:04.120]   They're probably heavily compressing it.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.560]   - Yeah, I mean, if you've got to figure
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.960]   if they're just saving images,
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:10.000]   then it's just a bunch of, you know,
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.160]   have 100, 200 K per site.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.600]   Like that's not a whole lot more
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.880]   considering they're already basically
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.800]   cashing the entire sites.
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:18.840]   - Wow.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.960]   - Yeah, and so there's the image.
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.480]   Then that overlay with the text is actually superimposed
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.320]   on top of the image.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.160]   - Oh it is.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.760]   - So yeah, so that's just like the little snippet
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.320]   of text you see below the blue link,
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.480]   just superimposed on the image.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.560]   - Just to show you here, look on the page,
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:31.400]   just where it is.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.200]   Because if you can right click and open it.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.640]   - No, no, no, look.
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.400]   So on the left, the snippet has gotten email this morning.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.320]   This is on my website.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.120]   On the right, one of the radio stations,
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.360]   it almost seems like a random snippet.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.760]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.640]   But like if you right click on the image itself
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.200]   and say open image and new tab,
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.800]   you'll see the image without the call out, you know?
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:51.640]   - Got it.
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.480]   So they are doing some--
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.680]   - So that call out is, you know--
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:54.840]   - Some JavaScript or something.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.160]   - Some JavaScript happening on top.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.000]   Yep.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000]   - Yeah.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000]   - Interesting.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.840]   But now this, so is this an image or is this the,
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.360]   no this is the actual page.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.680]   It pulled up the actual page for me.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:08.240]   Well that's, huh, I like that.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:14.320]   It isn't very Marissa, but I am sure that she did approve it.
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:17.600]   Google Wave, I don't know if this is your tip Gina.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.280]   - Yeah, we'll save that for that.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.120]   (laughing)
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:20.960]   - I won't mention it.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.120]   - I won't mention it.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.440]   (laughing)
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.960]   - Her eulogy.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.320]   In fact, let's do art, let's do it.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.880]   Let's wrap her up here.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.720]   Let's do our tip.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.360]   Oh God, well how late did it get?
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.360]   Oh my God, I lost track of the time.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.200]   (laughing)
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.440]   - We're having so much fun, you know?
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.000]   - You know this happens to me every time with this show.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.520]   It's supposed to be an hour long and already,
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.800]   we're like, you know, an hour and a half in.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:44.920]   I'm sorry, Gina Trapana, your tip of the week.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.680]   - So for the dozen of you who loved Wave
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.720]   as much as I did, actually bought my book
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:52.840]   and have waves, in Wave that you'd like to preserve,
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.360]   there's now an official export feature.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.280]   So there are plenty of gadgets and bots
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.720]   that would export things in Wave,
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.080]   but they're all little janky
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.840]   or had something wrong with them here and there.
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.600]   This is the official exporting feature
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.600]   that the Wave team promised when they announced
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.520]   that Wave would only be around this
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.080]   through the end of the year.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.040]   So if you just go in a Wave, open up a Wave,
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.000]   there's an export button on the toolbar
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.840]   and you can export as HTML, I'll Facebook export,
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.000]   or a zip file bundle with all the attachments
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.120]   that might be, you know, included with your Wave.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.080]   And that takes a little longer.
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.120]   - How would you rebuild it?
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:28.120]   I mean, what would you display it in as a webpage or?
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.640]   - Yeah, it's all HTML.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:30.480]   - Just plain HTML.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.840]   - Yeah, HTML, yep.
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:35.480]   So they're gonna give a way to export multiple waves at once,
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.440]   right now this is a one wave at a time thing,
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.080]   but they've been promising the whole time
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.680]   that export would be possible
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.400]   before they kind of shut down Wave.google.com proper.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:44.720]   So this is the first step.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.560]   - Right.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:51.040]   Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.480]   - It survives the show.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.320]   - It did.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.160]   - It did.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.000]   - It did.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:55.840]   - It did.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:58.120]   - 297 billion.
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:29:59.680]   Usually when you use a number like that big,
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:02.040]   it's Google, but it's not this case, it's Facebook.
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.080]   I was astounded at this.
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:06.520]   E-Week says that Facebook trowounces Yahoo, Microsoft,
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.720]   Google and display ads,
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:13.720]   that they had 297 billion,
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:16.880]   apparently what the period is here,
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:21.080]   add impressions for 23.1% of the market for the quarter.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:26.520]   And so that goes up from 13.9%,
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:30.040]   which is a 10% increase there, which is quite considerable.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:33.360]   And it now swipes the mantle, as they say, from Yahoo.
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:36.880]   That's to me utterly astounded,
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.600]   but when you have 500 million people, that's what happens.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.600]   - Wow.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:44.840]   - News sites in the US tend to get about 12 page views per user
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:48.400]   per month, Facebook gets that per day.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.160]   And that's why they have the scale.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:53.560]   And so now, we always thought Facebook has no business model.
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:56.200]   Well, hello, it's pretty impressive.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.080]   And when you remember too,
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:00.800]   they have incredible opportunities to target against this.
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.720]   However, here's the interesting thing.
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:06.960]   The CPM, the ad rate charged is much lower.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:11.440]   It's roughly a dollar compared with $3 for display ads on Yahoo.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:16.080]   And so I find that interesting,
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:20.040]   but kind of, you make it up on volume and they really do.
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.960]   So that was pretty impressive to me.
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.760]   Yahoo was a distant second with 11% of the market
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.800]   and 140 billion impressions.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:31.800]   Microsoft 64 billion, Google 2.7% of the share,
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:35.280]   but of course, they're not so much of content site
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.160]   as the others.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:38.960]   One more note on just advertising.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.760]   As I thought more about Facebook deals last week,
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:45.920]   it really struck me, the clever brilliance of it,
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:49.760]   that if you're gonna have deals for millions of sites,
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.080]   the challenge is sales.
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:54.480]   So they got rid of the sales challenge by giving it away.
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.200]   And they'll get their free deals on here.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.360]   And then as we said last week,
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:02.480]   they'll be able to upsell the best ones to create ads,
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:05.560]   to drive you to their places, to get the deal.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.120]   And the volume and the scale of Facebook
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.640]   starts to really take off here
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:14.000]   and show what's possible from a business model.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.120]   And so these numbers just wowed me.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:19.000]   - Truly amazing.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.840]   - Yeah, just it's, I mean--
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:22.680]   - Crazy times.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.800]   - I don't think we would have thought of numbers that big,
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.260]   even a few years ago.
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:29.080]   And it's just the beginning.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.600]   We're gonna start, you know,
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.320]   I mean, well, you know, it's funny though,
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:35.320]   I have to say, I don't know, maybe Facebook slowed down
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.600]   or maybe they just stopped talking numbers,
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:39.480]   but you keep hearing 500 million,
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:40.840]   but it's been that way for awhile.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.760]   I mean, I presume it's more than 500 million now.
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:44.760]   - I think I heard 550 is the latest number
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.560]   right here out there.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.720]   - Interesting.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.320]   I'll go look at it right now.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:52.000]   - My tool of the week is something you can't use,
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.280]   you can't have, but maybe someday it's called rock melt.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.880]   Now I think I sent you guys invitations.
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:59.640]   - You did, I couldn't figure it out, yeah.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:01.880]   (laughing)
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:02.720]   - The reason it's--
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:03.560]   - I mean, you know.
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:07.240]   - And the reason, the reason it's on this show
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.960]   is because it is based on chromium.
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:13.840]   You remember a browser called Flock some time ago,
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.760]   it was a social browser.
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:18.120]   Rock melt is heavily, by the way,
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:21.640]   heavily funded by people like Mark Andreessen,
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:23.640]   who invented Netscape.
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.200]   In fact, the founders of Rock melt,
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:28.360]   we interviewed one of them on net at night last night,
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.680]   come from Mark's company, Loudcloud,
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.440]   and one of them from Netscape before that.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.560]   So these guys have some history with browsers.
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.520]   Rock melt is a social browser like Flock,
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.720]   unlike Flock, Flock was based on Firefox,
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:45.280]   unlike Flock, this one is based on chromium.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:46.840]   So if you're a Chrome fan,
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:49.680]   you don't lose your Chrome functionality,
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:51.960]   but you get a lot of social functionality on the side.
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:55.200]   The first thing you'll do when you launch Rock melt
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:57.200]   is log into your Facebook account.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.080]   No good if you don't have a Facebook account,
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:00.720]   so that leaves a few of you out.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.720]   Almost left me out, I'm glad I went back to Facebook,
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.720]   'cause actually it's kind of interesting.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:07.720]   There's some interesting features,
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.680]   there's the social features which I won't dwell on,
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:12.960]   but these are my friends on the left-hand side
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.640]   based on recent posts on Facebook friends.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:19.040]   You can add feeds, so there's the tech meme feed
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.280]   and it pops out and it can also be torn off.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.200]   You can also add Twitter, so there's the Twitter feed,
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.600]   it can be torn off, and so a lot of that functionality
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:30.080]   is just kind of built into the browser.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:31.440]   You could do that with extensions,
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:32.640]   but they also change search.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:34.760]   Notice that unlike Chrome,
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.240]   you still have that kind of search window,
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.920]   but they've put back the little search box here.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.120]   - Aw.
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.280]   - Yeah, I know, I don't like that, however.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.160]   - You might like this, and I don't know.
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.000]   If you don't go to google.com,
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.720]   and you hit Gina Trapani and hit Return,
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:51.360]   this search results show up here with the thumbnails,
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.960]   just kind of in a little side window here.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:55.920]   - Okay, that's nice. - Which I kind of like.
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.280]   If I get to a page I like,
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:00.840]   like let's say that worksmark video, let's go back to it.
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:03.400]   I can share it by polishing the share button,
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.040]   post a link to my wall or tweet it right away,
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:08.080]   and I can also, if I like this page,
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.720]   I can drag it over to the sidebar
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.640]   and it will take the RSS feed and add the RSS feed,
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:17.000]   so I'm gonna add the RSS feed for Lifehacker, essentially,
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.040]   to my regular RSS feeds, which is kind of cool.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.040]   So there's some interesting features
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.280]   that you can do with this, very easy to share.
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:27.680]   I think this is worth looking at.
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.320]   Now you have to go to rockbell.com
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.200]   and request an invite, I understand,
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:33.160]   they are rolling these out pretty quickly.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:37.160]   So within a day or two you should get an invite.
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.080]   It's no good, again, if you don't have a Facebook account,
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.720]   'cause that ties everything to Facebook.
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.400]   And as one additional advantage,
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:46.080]   if you're worried about firesheet,
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:49.280]   it's more secure because unless you log into Facebook directly,
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:53.960]   all of these logins are done via the rock melt servers
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:57.200]   with SSL, so you could actually visit your Facebook friends,
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.240]   post on Facebook and so forth,
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:03.440]   on open access points safely by doing this.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.000]   So there's some advantages to it.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.520]   It's kind of an interesting feature.
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:09.240]   There's a lot of features in here I didn't mention,
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:11.120]   but worth taking a look, rockmelt.com.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.120]   It's free, it's based on Chrome.
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:14.320]   And they have been keeping it up to date.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.440]   They say they will keep up to date.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:18.640]   It's the Chromium, open source version of Chrome,
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.520]   but they have an auto update feature
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.000]   and the effects have already updated at once
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.880]   since I installed it yesterday.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.440]   We are out of time, and I wanna thank you Joel,
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:27.520]   for joining us, really great to have you Joel Johnson.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.440]   - Yes. - Yes.
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:32.600]   - Gizmo-do, gizmo-do.com.
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:35.760]   You can also follow him on Twitter @JoelJohnson.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:36.600]   Thanks for being here. - Thanks, Ben.
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:37.440]   - Joel, have you back. - Yeah, thanks a lot.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.560]   - Great to talk to you. - I appreciate it.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.480]   - Yeah, I'm glad to have you.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:40.560]   - Jeff Jarvis, of course,
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.440]   he's at Buzzmachine.com,
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.960]   and he's the author of "What Would Google Do?"
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.360]   Soon to be the author of "Public Parks."
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.680]   Any day now.
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:50.680]   (laughing)
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:51.760]   I scared him.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:53.000]   Sorry about that.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.320]   Gina Travani is at smartnourware.org
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:59.200]   and we didn't really get to talk about what you did in DC.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.360]   - It was a lot of fun.
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:01.920]   Developer Day hacked at the FCC.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.240]   We were hacking net neutrality
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.920]   into the wires of the building.
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.320]   - Really? - So trying.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.440]   - Rock on. - Rock on.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.840]   - Keep up the good work.
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.080]   That's awesome.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.400]   Thank you, Gina, Jeff, Joel.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:12.680]   Thank you for being here, everybody.
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:15.360]   You can watch us do this show live one o'clock
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:16.800]   every Wednesday afternoon,
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.760]   that's Pacific time, 4 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:23.480]   That would be 2100 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.040]   Of course, if you missed the live version,
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:26.560]   please download the show.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.520]   It's available to you at twit.tv/twig.
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.760]   You can also subscribe and get it automatically.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:33.800]   It is a podcast, both audio and video.
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:35.200]   We are doing our best of.
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:39.800]   I want to encourage you to go to twit.tv/bestof
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.040]   because I haven't told you, Jeff and Gina,
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.680]   and we're not gonna do a show the week after Christmas.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:44.960]   Give you some time off.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:47.960]   But we will do a cut down of the best moments
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:50.040]   of this week in Google from the past year.
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.080]   And we'd like our listeners to tell us what those were.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:57.080]   Twit.tv/bestof, pick this week in Google
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.440]   and submit your favorite bits.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.720]   And we will collate those and make a great edit.
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:04.440]   Everyone will love to hear of the best of twig.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:05.480]   That's a great idea.
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:06.720]   That's gonna be fun. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.960]   And Joel, close your ears because we are also,
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.480]   you want to tell everybody covering the gadget event,
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.280]   the GDGT event this Friday live from San Francisco.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.120]   - I like those guys.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:17.960]   I have no beef with them.
