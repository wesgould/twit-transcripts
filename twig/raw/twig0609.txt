[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.200]   sometimes. A lot of times about Facebook and Twitter and all sorts of stuff. Partly because we
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.760]   have many interests. Ant Pruitt is here. He is our photography guru and is the father of hardheads
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:58.320]   and is shows Twitter TV/hands on photography. Hello Anthony. Hello Mr. LaPort actually answer
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.880]   middle name so I shouldn't call you Anthony. I should call you Ant right? Call me Ant. It's
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.760]   a lot easier to say. I can't answer good name and it's unique. My son is Henry. He calls himself
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.400]   Hank. Same thing. It's like boom. When I first met him I called him Hank and then I felt bad
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.600]   because I didn't really like it. Make sure it was approved. Hank approved but he was cool with it.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.400]   Or you can call him sodium. What is it? Sodium deficiency. I can't think of that name on TikTok.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.680]   But I do like that I keep getting fed his TikTok. Good. Unlike the other critics.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.320]   He's hot at TikTok. It's nice to see you pop up. It's salt underscore Hank if you want to subscribe.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.880]   Jeff Jarvis is here. Wait a minute. Oh let me. I threw away the title. The Leonard literally.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.680]   Leonard Taap professor for journalistic innovation at the Currrr. Great. New mark.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.280]   A new mark. Graduate school journalism at the City University of New York. Hello Mr. Professor.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.760]   Hello. Happy, happy Ed Balls day. Should I dare I ask? You lost me at Ed Balls.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.120]   10 years ago. 10 years ago on the state the British politician Ed Balls went on Twitter and
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.720]   somebody showed him how to use it and he obviously was searching for his name so Ed Balls tweeted
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:29.120]   Ed Balls. And I'm juvenile enough still. I still find that funny as does the entirety of the
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.720]   United Kingdom. So there's stories all over media about how it's the 10th anniversary of Ed Balls
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.960]   day or Ed Balls. He is currently the shadow chancellor of the ex checker. He looks like the
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.480]   kind of guy who would tweet balls. Yeah. Yeah. He was. So if you go down to line 61 you'll find
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.280]   the link where you see the original tweet. Oh well that's called that. You know if he were smart
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:02.000]   he would he would sell that as an NFT. Sounds that. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe not. Clearly not.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.960]   You know it's even better because the picture his avatar on this is of a little child.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:17.280]   That makes it really even more pecan if you will. It does. It does. It's juvenile to laugh.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.200]   I fully admit it. I've been 10 years old but I find it very funny.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.240]   Apparently this will forever be known as Ed Balls day.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.120]   You know. Happy Ed Balls day everybody. 500 years from now when people celebrate Ed Balls day
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.720]   and they go what is the origin of this day. No one knows. Lost in the mystery of time.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.960]   They're going to be like what's a Twitter. And she's right now regretting her.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.480]   You serve meatballs on this day. She's really regretting her parents on this show.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:57.040]   Stacey Higginbotham is here from StaceyOnIOT.com at GigastaceyOnTheTwitter. She's also the host of
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:06.960]   the IOT show with Kevin Toffle. Hello Stacey. Hello everyone. Hello. So Google's quarterly results
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:16.400]   are out. And wow. Another you know yes earlier today we did the Microsoft quarterly results.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.440]   Later today we'll get Apple's quarterly results. Google's earnings is smash sales records
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.360]   in particularly in the digital ad market. And this might maybe explain a little bit about flock
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.680]   and Google's abandonment of the third party tracker. They don't really need it. They're doing
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:48.080]   just fine with first party party ads. Thank you very much. First quarter sales revenue 55.3 billion.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:57.840]   That's up year over year 34%. That is so bonkers and they're like it's an increase from a
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.560]   diminished from the diminishment of the pandemic. But if you actually look historically. This is
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:13.760]   far and away just crazy. I just I mean like 10 years ago we're looking at sub 10 billion in Q1
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:21.680]   revenue. This is quarterly. It's bulkers. Okay quarterly 33 31 billion alone 32 billion alone
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:29.680]   from search Gmail and maps. YouTube 6 billion. That's almost a 50% increase. A lot of people
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.440]   staying home and watching YouTube right now the profit when they bought YouTube. I know
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:42.800]   boy they got their money's worth profit. Remember this is a three month period. 18 billion dollars
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.520]   is got to be nice to make like one and a half billion dollars a week.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.240]   And they also I mean think about this they've been shutting off all of these crazy unprofitable
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:01.040]   businesses for the last like two years. So if you think about it. Yeah. Just to reap in what
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.240]   that's what you do. You know if you're a smart business you get rid of the the debt. Well yes
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:14.240]   and no you I mean you have to you have to have the other bets to help offset the eventual decline.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.880]   Right. Credit. Credit to Ruth poor at a very good CFO because the judgment you have to make
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   is is is this losing money but going to grow or is this losing money forever.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.960]   And she apparently has done the right thing and cut the stuff that's never going to make money
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.760]   and has kept the stuff that presumably will make money down the road. This is a profit
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:41.200]   increase of 162 percent from last year. Now remember last year as you said Stacey wasn't great because
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:48.400]   the COVID had already you know hit but still this is pretty good. Google will dedicate 50 billion
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:56.560]   more than it made actually for a repurchasing of shares. This is very good for the stock price.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.400]   Let's talk about that for a second. Yeah. Well let's talk about that for a second though.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.200]   Is I think that's because there's another story somewhere in the rundown about how well Google
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.360]   and Facebook always companies grew so big by making acquisitions. Right. And now with the antitrust
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:19.840]   breadth down their back there instead of having the cash that they have go toward
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.280]   what I would argue are productive things. They're doing the financial game and they're buying
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.160]   back shares which helps no one but the shareholders and doesn't invest in the future of the
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.080]   internet and doesn't buy other companies and give others the benefit of that. And this isn't to me
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.880]   a side effect of the antitrust mood that some folks are in right now.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.480]   No. I know. It's actually too bad. I say that as a shareholder.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:54.160]   No. No, Jeff. I think there is a legitimate case to be made that you're like hey you should
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.720]   invest in things but Google's cash on hand exceeds a hundred billion dollars.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.560]   So when you have that much money sitting around that is a function of you are accruing.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:12.160]   I mean I know in Wall Street terms there's no such thing as too much cash or too high a profits
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:19.520]   but when you have that much cash sitting around you do have to do something with it. And yes
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:25.680]   you could say I can't buy anymore. But well yeah I see that they can't buy any more company or
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   that they might be hesitant to buy other companies but I also see that you can't deploy a hundred
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.520]   billion dollars buying small things you have to buy big things. And I would say the ability to amass
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:43.360]   that much capital over a relatively short amount of time is indicative of the fact that
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.360]   there's no competition for them. This is a problem for Apple as well.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:55.040]   There is a benefit to stock repurchase. There are a couple of benefits. Of course it does
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.960]   increase the value of the stock because you're decreasing the number of shares.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.400]   But remember that the stock is one of the ways companies like Google attract the best employees.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:13.120]   So improving the stock market, the stock value, the stock price helps you acquire better employees.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.000]   So there is a direct benefit to the company. And I think you're right Stacey it's a problem for
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.600]   any company that rakes in so much cash they got to do something with it. You can do acquisitions but
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.680]   acquisitions are more than the cost of an acquisition is more than the money you spend.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.720]   You then got to assimilate them you've got to use it properly. There are many many cases of companies
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:39.520]   throwing away money on acquisitions. Microsoft threw away money on Nokia and Overchir and took
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.320]   huge write-ups. Google's probably the same. The other thing you could spend money on Jeff says
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:50.720]   is R&D. Here's the graph of Google's R&D spend and R&D spend has been going up and up and up.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.800]   It was 27 and a half billion in 2020. I don't know what it will be this year. But there's a very
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.560]   steady increase in R&D spending. So it's not like they're coming back on R&D. I would also argue
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:08.880]   they could pay their taxes. Oh, but that's not the government that you're right. They're right.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.160]   No, I'm not the government to do that. That's not the Google to do. They're not going to pay more
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.840]   than they're required to. Right. No, I'm just pointing out that if we tax them appropriately
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.200]   and shut off various loopholes, we might be able to, instead of Google saying, "Oh, I'm going to
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:30.320]   invest in my R&D," to bring fiber to the home or invest in wireless networks or whatever,
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:38.800]   we could actually do that maybe on a federal level. I'm with you. We should tax the rich.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.480]   Damn them. That graph you showed. I figured that would be the draw to get some of the best
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.080]   employees into the company. Just part of it. You would be in, invest it into the company.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.560]   You want to work for a company that's on the move. All right. If you're maybe in a industry.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.440]   I'm going to hire you. I say, "Come to work for this great company because it's wonderful."
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.840]   Oh, by the way, we'd like to give you stocks so that you could participate in our success.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.600]   That does add some value to it. I think that would add value to someone that's in a leadership role.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.880]   I don't think it's for the people that are under, like in the subordinate levels.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.600]   They're engineers to get stocks to build something. That's how Amazon gave this.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.640]   They got stock and they got rich on it. Yeah. Amazon's like, "Here's your stock."
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.040]   But I'm thinking the draw would be more along the lines of, "Come join this team and build
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.680]   something big." That's because you're not motivated by money. Yeah, maybe that's...
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.120]   That's nice, Ant. I have my mom. Don't get me wrong. I like cash too.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:45.760]   They're competing against Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and some small startups.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:51.520]   And I'm sure that if you're coming out of college, you got great skills. You are the top 1% of programmers
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.720]   say or engineers. You have your choice of any company. You might be saying, "Well, I should work
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.320]   for a startup because I like they're going to change the world because they figured out how to do
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.360]   blood tests with just a drop of blood." Or, "I want to work for..." I think if you're looking at a company
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:13.200]   like Google, there's a risk for Google that, "Yeah, Google. They've done it all. They've been there.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.320]   What could I do to make a difference at a behemoth like Google?" Right.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   So it may be hard for them to acquire people on the market that you described who were looking for
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.800]   the great company to work for. It might be a lot easier for them to attract people by saying,
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.600]   "Oh, and by the way, our stock is worth 700 bucks a share and you're going to get 100,000 of them.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.960]   Welcome." Okay. Yeah, now you're talking.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:45.600]   I've been told I have no idea. No one's ever offered me a job for any of these companies,
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   but I have been told that that is one of the reasons companies want to keep their stock price
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.280]   high because they use it as an incentive to bring people in and probably to keep good.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:00.320]   But even without the stock repurchase, Google's stock was headed. Well, actually, it was a little
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.200]   segment. You're right. You're right. Amazon's was going up. Google's was a little lost a little
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.960]   steam. That's why I don't like to talk about stock value so much when we talk about tech in our
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:16.160]   context because it isn't always a reflection of how well a company's doing or how well it's
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.960]   innovating. In Apple's case, there's stock market values through the roof, but a lot of that's
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.120]   because they rebuy a lot of that. They've gone back, right? Yeah. So they're hard of... They didn't do
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.120]   for a long time. They didn't. And their stock has gone up a lot more since.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.160]   So that's a way you can kind of... But that doesn't tell us anything about the company,
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.480]   just that they're willing to reinvest profit. My view is the internet is yet yon.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.960]   And so more investment in internet development of new things makes me happy. The problem is,
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.720]   Google could go into an entirely new field, but they get smashed for new... Even if they didn't buy
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.640]   it, they just went into it. They'd be accused of steamrolling somebody else right now.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:56.480]   So I wonder whether that money could be invested in entirely new lines of business that would be
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:03.520]   productive, but won't be now. That's my point. That's the real swill. That's that Washington Post
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.400]   story that you're talking about, which I thought was biting the hand that feeds it, but still...
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.440]   Because Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post. Well, they have to do that every now and then
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:23.760]   to prove that they're not under his thumb. It was honestly an argument to break up the big tech
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:30.240]   companies. I mean, remember this is in Washington, DC, and Congress probably reads this. How tech,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:37.440]   big tech got so big, hundreds of acquisitions. And the thing that's the most interesting about this
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:45.360]   is that the acquisitions are clearly designed to do a couple of things to either...
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.960]   And this, by the way, is David Sisselini from Rhode Island, who is the chair of the Antitrust
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.760]   Committee. He said, "These monopolies have exploited the weaknesses of the existing law and
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:02.960]   lax enforcement to maintain and expand their market dominance by buying up or burying those
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.000]   they perceive as competitive threats." And here's the biting the hands that feeds you
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.040]   part of it. Here's Amazon. So on the left, it's kind of hard to
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:19.840]   grok this right off the bat. Acquisitions in the original business, which is selling books,
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.320]   on the right acquisitions in sectors they are not. Which was never really the original business.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.920]   That's a business right there. Well, let's say e-commerce. Yeah. Well, Amazon knew that,
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.920]   but watch because initially a lot of e-commerce purchases, and then here and there, purchase
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:44.480]   in new sectors. But as time goes by, where 2007 suddenly, the e-commerce purchases slow way down.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:51.600]   And by 2012, most of the acquisitions are on the right hand side. They're in new areas, publishing,
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:17:01.680]   Twitch, social, video games, IoT, video, e-sports. They're suddenly buying robotics.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:10.000]   And now you might just say, "Well, that's a company that's growing and entering new fields."
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.080]   But if they're using their monopoly on the left side to enter new sectors on the right,
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:22.160]   that's when the Antitrust... Well, how do they use it? How do they use them monopoly
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.880]   and e-commerce to go into Twitch?
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:34.000]   For Amazon? Or Amazon. Wait, are you talking about Amazon or Google?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.800]   Explain how Amazon uses its monopoly power in one market to enter new markets, Stacy.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.840]   So Amazon, actually the Wall Street Journal did a lovely article citing examples like two weeks
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:51.520]   ago. But for example, they have the ability to sell lots of things. So when they started talking
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.840]   about E.K.O.B. on the smart home site, E.K.O.B. is the maker of a smart... What's it called?
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:04.480]   Thermostat. Amazon actually invested in them too. They told E.K.O.B. that they wanted data
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.960]   from the smart home that E.K.O.B. didn't want to give them, even if it wasn't tied to
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.720]   Madamay. And they were like, "No." And then Amazon's like, "Give us this data or we won't
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.920]   list you on our for sale on our platform." Oh, that's a really good example.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:22.480]   Right. That's bad. But in the example, we just came through. How did the power on the left
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:28.400]   lead to Twitch? It doesn't every single time. But you could say that if I am on Twitch, people's big
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:36.480]   revenue generator is tips and placement of devices. Maybe Amazon forbids a creator from going on Twitch
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:42.000]   and sending things to another website, for example, or using affiliate links in some place else.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.120]   Well, in the simplest form, you've built up a cash haul that you can use to acquire people.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:53.120]   Yeah, it's cash. Yeah, it's obvious. Right. Or you just do a lost leader on acquiring people
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.440]   in content or in future network effects. Yeah, you're going to afford to lose it.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:03.200]   You know, a really good example is diapers.com. This is all an e-commerce, but it's exactly how
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   any trust works, which is the undercut diapers.com until it wasn't profitable any more, and then they
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:18.800]   bought it. And it's how you kill competitors. So that's clearly monopolistic behavior,
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.520]   and it's illegal under US law. But if it's not prosecuted, and that's what Cecilini is saying,
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.400]   look, as we didn't enforce it, so they were able to do this kind of thing. Twitch might be a
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.920]   little bit harder to explain, except that maybe Amazon said, you know, gaming is the next,
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:41.600]   they bought other e-sports as well. Gaming is going to be a big category soon. We ought to expand into
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.840]   that category, and maybe they didn't use their monopoly to do that. But there are plenty of
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.560]   examples of them using their monopoly. Well, that can always do it later. I mean, they don't have to,
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.760]   you can buy something and be like, well, we're not sure how this is going to work out, but we're
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:20:01.520]   going to keep an eye on it. Right. Anyway, that's, you know, we'll see. The EU is expected to announce
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:09.440]   an investigation of Apple's monopoly in its app store this week. Congress is clearly
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:15.200]   poised to do something, even the White House, as we talked about before, Tim Wu and a number of
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:21.360]   other people who are very much about breaking up big tech. This is on the horizon. And who
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.320]   were dangerous to free speech? Well, we could talk about section 230. That's another area.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.880]   Yeah, another area. My blood pressure. You just wanted blood pressure.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:34.800]   Allergies. Yeah. Let's not get there. Let's not get there yet. We'll save your blood pressure for
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.760]   later. Let's finish the financials. Yes. So they had a Google had a good quarter.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.480]   Cloud. Now, let's talk about cloud because I think Stacey probably has some stuff to say about
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:52.240]   that was very big. $4 billion in the first quarter. That's another 46% growth from the year.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.600]   Yeah. Microsoft had a similar, in fact, maybe even larger growth in its cloud sector,
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:04.080]   huge growth in the cloud sector. That's as much a change in the way things work these days as
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:13.760]   anything else. And COVID, right? Maybe if I'm looking at, I mean, Google's cloud earnings are
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:22.000]   nothing compared. Well, not nothing. They're what? Minuscule. Amazons are going to be like 15.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.840]   Google's a fraction of Microsoft, which is a fraction of AWS.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:31.520]   Yeah. AWS. Let's see. They have Q4. I don't think Amazon has reported yet for
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:39.360]   Q1, but Q4 of last year, they were $12.7 billion. I'm just looking to see Q1 of 20
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:47.600]   looking for the number. I don't know. But the point is so small.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:56.560]   Profit margins on, I would be really interested in having Google spin out its profit margins on
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:02.560]   cloud. I feel like they do a lot of marketing and stuff that AWS and Azure don't have to do,
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:09.280]   because Google is still very much an also ran cloud. They have, I feel like they must give a lot
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:16.080]   of way, basically. I don't know what else to say about that, but they're spending, I mean,
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.920]   it makes sense for Google to have a cloud operation simply because they've got to support
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.760]   their own operations. And this is like an add on to everything they have to do anyway.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.320]   Does that make sense? Yeah. So if you look at their CAPEX and their data center planning,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:35.040]   they might as well throw a cloud in there. Brady are in our Discord chat was wondering if
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.200]   you could say that Google's cloud has anything more than a hobby at this point.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:47.360]   It's more than a hobby simply because they hired Thomas Curian. I mean,
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.920]   this is a big deal for them. They do want to boost this and they're going to get much better.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:59.760]   They've finally hired people who are cutthroat and willing to like offer cloud in real enterprise
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:06.800]   services. So yes. And by the way, you just got a big contract with what it is young.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.440]   Oh, really? For backing for the broadcast? It's a Spanish language broadcast.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.320]   It's their digital transformation. But I, okay. Stacey sounds skeptical.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.720]   That's just, you know, I don't get so excited about media companies. Your cloud demands as a
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:30.000]   media company are not as exciting as your cloud demands as many other types of companies, I guess.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.920]   I'm just, I don't know. I'm like, fine. It's not like getting a financial services,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:41.840]   like a bank or something or even an interesting industrial manufacturing client. It's a media
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:48.080]   company. The self-same Brady are asked or actually responded to you, Jeff. Yeah, there's an area he'd
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:55.600]   like to see Google put some of that money into it. Google fiber deploys. Yeah. Yeah. They kind of
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.080]   backed off on that. That's not economical for Google. I know. That's all. Okay. But they got enough
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.040]   money. Let's help some people out here. They announced two new deploys in Utah last week.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.680]   Up all things. I thought they were done with it, but apparently not completely. Not utterly done.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:19.280]   Yeah. But the cost of that eventually go down over time? No. No. So their issue is Google. Google
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:24.080]   thought they could do it. They built their own equipment. They came up with some really innovative
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.240]   trenching things. But what happens with fiber, it doesn't scale like, you know, deploying servers
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:36.720]   or software scales. You still have to dig that. Still have to dig a trench. Yeah. And they were
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.560]   probably counting on and you're an expert on this Stacy sold to Ferdy Yawn this
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:49.920]   sharing telephone polls with utilities. Yeah. They were. They thought the good fight to try to
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:57.440]   get access to telephone polls. And there is actually a Facebook is pioneering a better aerial fiber.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:03.440]   This is for the last mile that they because you can trench to a certain point, but at some point
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:10.160]   you got to get to the house. The trench is usually to the house. Is it your trench everywhere? Oh, okay.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.040]   You aerial you hang it from the telephone polls for like along the roadways. And then there's the
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:20.800]   last like a hundred feet. Oh, you trench that. So the other way around. Okay. Got it. That makes
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:26.720]   sense. And also it's not I don't think they talk about this a lot, but they actually build their
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:34.000]   own Metro fiber ring around each city. They don't use other people's infrastructure for this. So
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.160]   they like in Austin, when they finally launched it, they brought us all in and they showed us like
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:47.360]   where they actually it. I was like, that is like a full on telco deployment. I mean, it was pretty
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:59.280]   significant. I thought. And even so you get it. Right. And the and what they wanted, the technology
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.440]   they thought they had for they called it micro trenching. It didn't work out. So then they ended
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:13.040]   up having to like, right, truly dig holes. So, okay. So Google's got okay. So we all
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.080]   agreement Google has a lot of money. We don't agree on how they spend that money.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:27.040]   And we wish they would spend it on something that we would like, you know, like a pony. But no,
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:34.640]   they keep playing by stock. Now, are we in agreement? That's kind of that's the gist of that conversation.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.920]   And they bought back a bunch of stock in the past. No, this is it. They don't
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:45.440]   know. That's a lot. 50 billion is a lot, especially when your profits were only 33 billion. That's a lot.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.360]   What were their profits? That's just for the quarter. That was just for the quarter. It was 18
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.000]   billion for the quarter. Wasn't it? Oh, yeah. Yeah. But that but the 50 billion is over a year or
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.880]   something. Okay. Those numbers are up to now. Oh, apples are out. All right. Let's do.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.280]   Let's go to the tape. You have a ticker tape in your office?
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:10.000]   You asking me? Let me reach out to the Bloomberg. If anybody do you have a bloop or do you miss
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.040]   the Jarvis? Yeah. No, he seems like he'd have a ticker tape over there under a glass dome.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:20.480]   And Stacy seems like she's got a blueberry table to burp terminal. Do I look like am I
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.920]   made a line of type? Yeah. All right. I'm going to I got something completely different.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.640]   Completely different. And then we'll do Apple. But I was just reading this great article.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:42.080]   Do you know what the Mandela effect is? Native. The Mandela effect is based on a researcher's
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:50.160]   discovery that most people think that Mandela died in jail. Nelson Mandela.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:56.880]   So really? Fiona Broome was a blogger named at the Mandela effect after she learned a number of
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.560]   people shared her erroneous belief. Human rights advocate Nelson Mandela perished in prison in the
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.080]   80s. Of course, remember, he got out of prison. He was the president of the company.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.560]   The country for God's sake. Yeah. But there is this Mandela effect. So I'm going to test you
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:17.760]   on the Mandela effect. Are you ready? Does the monopoly man have a monocle? True or false? Yes
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:25.200]   or no? Monopoly man? True. Yeah, it's a monocle, right? Right? True. Yeah. No, he never had a monocle.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.120]   Okay. The New Yorker, dude, has a monocle. The New York that's probably where this comes from as
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.600]   a confusion. Just like a lot of people think that they grew up eating jiffy peanut butter.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:42.320]   There is no jiffy. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, just or skippy. Yeah. Or gift. It's also proves that
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:47.440]   gift is gift because Jeff is Jeff. By the way, by the way, let's just be clear. All right. Okay.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:54.160]   We're not going to fight about that now. Later. Did Hannibal Lecture ever say hello Clarice?
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:01.040]   No, Hannibal Lecture. I guess you're going to all say no from now on because you kind of gathered the
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.080]   - I thought he did. - No, he did not. He said, good morning.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:11.920]   I didn't read the book. I saw the movie. No, this isn't the movie. Oh, geez. Yeah.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:17.200]   The killer never says the line in the movie instead. He says good morning when meeting Clarice for
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:24.160]   the first time. Good morning. Let's see here. This is kind of fun.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:33.760]   Do you remember Ed McMahon?
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.680]   I think he says the monocle is Mr. Peanut. Yeah, yeah, Mr. Peanut. Yeah. That's what happens,
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:45.520]   I think, is in your mind. Remember, because everybody thinks that the comedian Sinbad was in a movie
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.440]   as the genie, but he never was, but it's right. I did hear that because they mixed. Yeah.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:58.800]   Did Ed McMahon ever show up at anybody's house with a big oversized check? No. Yes. No. There was
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:05.440]   somebody else that I do know. No. He never appeared on camera as part of the prize patrol.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:14.160]   And he had better things to do like cash in his own checks. Yeah. Star Wars fans have apparently
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:23.680]   a lot of Mandela effects. What did Darth Vader tell Luke when he revealed his parentage? Do you say?
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:34.240]   Luke, I am your father. He said no. He said no. I am your father. No, I am your father. Yes.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.400]   I am your father. You remember that? Very good. Yes.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:41.520]   We watch a lot of Star Wars announced a hard time. All right, I'll give you some more. There's
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:55.440]   some more of these. Okay. Do you use? This is a bizarre one.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:03.040]   People think C3PO is all gold. He's covered with gold. You know better.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:09.600]   Right. He has wires hanging out of the right nearest belly, but I believe that's more like a
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.440]   shirt. The lower portion of his right leg below the knee is silver.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:22.640]   Okay. Do people think about this? I was kind of sick. He's brass. Did Tom Cruise
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:29.280]   in risky business dance in his underwear and Ray band sunglasses? Didn't watch risky business.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.920]   Oh, it's a classic. It's a sunglasses were different. See didn't wear sunglasses. Yes.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.160]   Right. Very good. And here's the it wasn't Sinbad. It was Shaq.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:46.400]   So I heard Sinbad. Okay. The widespread belief, an entire feature film exists called Shazam.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:51.520]   Oh, yes. Starring Sinbad is a genie. What they are probably recollecting is Kazam
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.240]   with Shaquille O'Neal.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:01.440]   That was Shaquille. But people, I tell you, people will swear. Oh, no, no. I remember Shazam. It was
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:07.360]   a great movie with Sinbad, right? Never. This is why witnesses are terrible. I witness is
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:13.840]   eternal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was Kazam with Shaq. But people thought they saw Shazam with Sinbad.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:19.440]   Yeah. All right. That was just a break so that you would be able to stop your discord.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:25.200]   Before we go in, can I just do a little plug for something? Yes. Thanks to Stacey. Yes.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.960]   So Tuesday, Stacey and her wonderful husband are nice enough to come and speak to a group of
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.840]   people trying to start their own media businesses through multiple school. Nice.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:41.680]   And I want to thank her for this. And if you're an independent journalist running a Stacey-like
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:47.120]   business, trying to make it go of it, serving your market directly, DM me if you qualify and
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.920]   we'll try to include you in, sit with your email address. I'm trying to start a business.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.280]   Stacey and Andrew, I have this idea for a podcast network.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:04.480]   Could I come in and just like, sure. You are far above and beyond my business. So, no, not true.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.720]   That's great that Andrew's doing it too. That's great. I'm very grateful. Thank you.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:14.800]   He's the money man. Yeah. It's a two part thing, right? Yeah. Yeah. He's also, I have seen the
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.920]   presentation. He's actually doing a presentation for you, Jeff. He's very conscientious. Are they
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:26.240]   PowerPoint slides or keynote? He would be doing PowerPoint and Google slides. Okay.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:33.920]   I would be working in keynote. But what was I going to say? He's run a publication for years
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:43.200]   like longer than I have. So nice. Stacey, when you found yourself on the street
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.560]   and debated to find another job or not, what was that conversation like with Andrew? He said,
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.960]   listen, we don't want to do this. No, don't do that. Or did you say, I want a job or do you say,
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.720]   I've had my last job, I'm fed up with it. How did that happen in your head? What would happen?
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:04.480]   Well, when I found myself on the street, it was like a week, if not less, that fortune said,
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:10.960]   we would like you to come to us. So my time on the street, like I don't have a resume. Like I,
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:20.160]   like, yeah. So I didn't have that in Andrew, but as I became increasingly miserable,
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.640]   Andrew was like, you could start a business.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:29.200]   Oh, no, I don't want to do that. Got it. He did. Well, I think it became pretty apparent that
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.480]   if I didn't start a business or leave that job that Andrew was going to be like, I don't want to
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.880]   believe, I don't want to live with you. It wasn't really that bad, but I was pretty unhappy.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.880]   How long were you there? Not even a year.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:48.880]   So from the first glimmer of a thought of, did you think about, I'll get all this in a second
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.960]   with the open up on this fascinating? Did you before you went there in that week in a
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.200]   Magnum? Did you think, no, I shouldn't do this. I should get it. Or did Andrew say, or did you
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.040]   think then I'm starting a business or was only when you were in the new job, you got miserable and said,
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:07.760]   all right. When I was overwhelmed at giga-ome, starting a business was always on the table as
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:16.720]   an option. So probably as far back as 2013. So it was festering. Yeah, like,
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.200]   that was some sort of. So when you started it, one last question. So when you started it,
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:31.280]   was there a cycle of hope and despair to hope and normalcy kind of? Was there a moment where you
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:35.200]   said, oh, what did I just do? Or did you, from the first minute say, thank God I've done this and
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:43.520]   never look back? Oh, no, no. I still question it. Like, even today, I'm like, I should get a resume
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:50.800]   put together. Really? Wow. Success. I respect that. It's very hard to do something on your own.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.200]   I'll talk about this with your people, actually. This isn't really a, I don't think a great,
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.160]   for existential soul searching purposes, I still having my own business hard.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.000]   Every time I go by a McDonald's, it has a help wanted sign. I still make a mental note.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.600]   Yeah, like seriously, I have my plan. My plan is Starbucks, barista for the win.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.920]   No, because I worked at McDonald's and I know how to run a fryer. And I think if ever I need a job,
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.240]   there you go. There's somebody looking, you can push those buttons. I got the skills.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:26.240]   They might say, you're a little old. How long has it been? 40 years. You could be a
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:33.360]   greeter at Walmart. I can always do that. No, no, no, people would never be able to shop
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.440]   because you talk them to death at the door. I think it would be a great greeter.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.880]   I beg your pardon. Hey, wait a minute. Come here. Let me tell you a story before you go shopping.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:50.400]   See, see, there are good Walmart greeters and didn't. What color was C3PO's leg?
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:56.320]   There he is dancing, by the way. See the silver leg? See there? Was it a spare part?
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.640]   Yeah, I think that's what the, those little jobas were doing when they,
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:05.600]   yeah. Oh, yeah. And here's another animated gift from the Discord. My name is Kazam.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.560]   Telly.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:17.520]   You know, that's one thing that we miss that we don't have in the IRC. It's probably a good
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:23.040]   thing is animated gifts, but they are all over the Discord. Everybody does that. It seems to be fun.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:28.400]   It makes it, yeah. Gives you the best. I kind of regret in Slack, they have that capability too.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.720]   I finally had to put my foot down and say, I'm trying to read these messages.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:39.440]   It's a business business. Oh my gosh. Are you one of those mean bosses who say no animated? Oh, Leo.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:45.920]   I just said in the general channel, right, I just want to be able to read the messages
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:52.960]   without having to wade through dancing bears. If you don't mind. Yeah, but then what's funny is
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:38:00.080]   you like within a week after that you put a Jeff in. I know, but I, well, but I had a good reason.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.840]   And I guess that was when we were raising money. So I had a little animated thermometer gift that
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.400]   showed, you know, how much money we'd raised. And I apologize. I said, I know I'm not supposed
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.960]   to do this, but I'm going to break my own rule later on. I put it in blue on the right now. We'll
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:21.760]   talk about base camp. Oh, oh, put a pin in that one. I do want to do it real quickly. Before we
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:27.200]   take a break, I want to. This was also from the Discord. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google,
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:34.000]   talking about the on CNN about the COVID crisis. At the highest levels from President Biden,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.800]   Secretary Blinken, there's been focus on engaging to see how we can help India and the other countries
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.760]   being affected. I won't play the whole thing. But I think it is important to note that Google is
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:51.200]   putting some of that money, $18 million towards the coast of COVID relief in India.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:56.240]   And I would hope to see other companies do the same thing. It's a global crisis. It's not a
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.960]   United States crisis. It's not a problem we can solve in the US all by ourselves.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:07.760]   Because if if people are dying in other countries from COVID-19, that's just as much of a risk to
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.640]   our shores as it is to theirs. So I'm glad to see the light and self-interest to help the world.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:17.760]   That's exactly right. Yeah, it's a global crisis. It's not a local crisis. Sometimes
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:24.240]   you got to do things globally, unfortunately. We will come back and I do want to do your little
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.920]   thing. Did you see the little little? No, we did Google earnings. They're done.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.840]   Apple's earnings. You probably could do Apple's. We could do Apple's. This isn't the Apple show.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.400]   Did you see? I know, but you. Yeah. No. Okay. You're right. Keep me honest. You're right.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.600]   Can I play the federal trade commission? Keeping you to your promise. I know she's tough.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.240]   I'm just saying. I've got it pulled up. I'm ready. Good. No, good. Because I don't. So good.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:53.760]   Keep it real quickly. And then we will go to our ads. Google's ad from the Oscars the other
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:59.040]   night. Did you see this? I'm what's called the code. This was really good. Child of deaf adults.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.160]   My parents were both born deaf.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:13.040]   How many people are deaf in the world as a search? 466 million. Hello in sign language. And he gets
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:22.720]   a little grandchild. Turn on caption. Isn't that great? Love the captions.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:33.920]   Oh, okay. I'm going to cry now. Damn. You go. And they're teaching their baby sign, which is wonderful.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:39.120]   Oh, I love you. Yeah. We can't wait for you to meet him.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:47.680]   And it's actually appropriate for the Oscars because one of the nominated movies,
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.880]   the sound of metal isn't exactly about that. The experience of the deaf community. And boy,
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:59.440]   if you haven't seen that, it's a well worth it. It's what a good movie. Yeah, that's touching,
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:05.600]   isn't it? Yeah. All right. Now we can take a break. And then when we come back, Stacey Higgenbotham
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:13.200]   with Apple's quarterly earnings. Stacey will go on the call with us. From Wall Street.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:18.080]   We from the Nasdaq headquarters on Times Square in New York.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:26.480]   I want to talk about our financial reporters. Stacey Higgenbotham. Picking away, Stacey. Not yet.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:34.000]   No, not yet. We got a commercial. Not yet. I will be the traffic reporter. Skip the report.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.840]   I'm up here in the chopper five and it's looking pretty good. Okay.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:44.320]   Are you sure today? I'll be the weather reporter. It's foggy again in San Francisco. Don't surprise.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:49.200]   Happens every day. What do you need weather for? The marine layer. I call it the marine layer.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:57.760]   Our show today brought to you by Audible. I'm oh man, Audible fan, obviously Audible's a long
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:03.440]   time sponsor of all of our shows. But also I was an Audible subscriber back in 2000.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:09.520]   It's my 21st year getting Audible hundreds of audiobooks, I should say in my library.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:14.880]   And what's great about Audible is that library grows and I can go back and listen to those
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.840]   audiobooks anytime I want, which is wonderful. But it's not just audiobooks anymore. Audible is about
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:26.160]   audio of all kinds. A leading provider of spoken word entertainment all in one place. You can
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:32.080]   find the largest selection of audiobooks. Bar none. If it's on audiobook, it's on Audible.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:37.840]   Ranging from bestsellers and new releases to celebrity, memoirs, languages, business,
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.880]   motivation, and more. Get original entertainment from top celebrity creators and thousands of
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:48.960]   popular and binge-worthy podcasts. Something brand new at Audible since we talked about Audible last
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:57.360]   is called Audible Plus. And basically they've got a huge selection of audio entertainment that's
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:03.120]   yours to listen to. All you can eat in effect. So all about giving members a chance to listen to
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:08.400]   and discover new favorites, to explore new formats like the exclusive words plus music series,
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.440]   a podcast maybe you've never considered before. Theatrical performances you get original entertainment
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:18.080]   from top celebrity creators, thousands of popular and binge-worthy podcasts. That's the one I'm
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.480]   listening to right now up there on the upper left. It's Barack Obama's. Now normally Audible has
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:30.240]   great actors hired to read these. But in the case of a Promised Land, which is the former president's
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:36.880]   memoir of his time in office, he reads it. And it's great because you're in effect hearing in his
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:42.480]   voice what it's like to walk into the Oval Office for the first time, what it's like to sit down
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.760]   with the cabinet table for the first time. You know, he describes the situation room. He says,
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.800]   from movies, I thought it was going to be this giant cavernous place with this big table and
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:59.360]   lots of screens and stuff. He says really kind of a small room. And with some some TVs, it would be
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:05.360]   changed to be at a sports bar on the wall. It's really great. He's got a sense of humor. He's a
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.440]   very, very talented writer writing this book shortly after the end of my president. And he can
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.920]   remember, he can after Michelle and I had boarded Air Force one for the last time and traveled west
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:20.400]   for a long deferred break. The mood on the plane was better sweet. He's it's just really great.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:26.160]   But that's one of the things I love about Audible is it brings the experience of people into your
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:34.640]   years into your life in a way that no printed book can do. And you can listen to audiobooks,
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:40.960]   whether you're watching the dog or washing the dishes. Lisa and I have formed a new habit,
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:45.840]   which I really like of instead of watching TV at night, we'll go to bed early and we'll put a
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:50.800]   audio book on and listen to it together. And it's really wonderful. She picks one, then I pick one,
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:57.120]   then she picks one. I just I'm just a huge fan. And we're really happy to have Audible back as a

[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:19.600]   Folks, if you know, do you ever listen to audiobooks? I don't know if you're an Audible.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:24.640]   Oh, yes, sir. I love audiobooks. And I got a ball in the pick with you because on
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:30.960]   Twitter this Sunday, you brought up an audiobook that you loved and had all of the different emotions
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:36.880]   involved and whatnot. And my argument is American Gods, the full cast version. Love it.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:43.120]   Oh, love it. So, dad, I'm good. I put that audiobook up against any other.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:48.880]   No, and I've listened to it. I own it. And the 10th anniversary edition is a full cast production.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:55.600]   Audible does this with some of the books. They did that with Neil Gaiman's, I'm sorry,
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:03.600]   yeah, Neil Gaiman's other, his comic book, the Sandman, the production of that is just as good.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:08.080]   Are they Audible? Are they pulling it from the BBC versions?
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:12.960]   No, Harper audio. So, let me play a little bit of the American Gods for you.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:18.480]   They took her to the cemetery in a big old Cadillac. They took her to the cemetery,
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.320]   but they did not bring her back. Old song.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:30.240]   I have taken the liberty. Said Mr. Wednesday, washing his hands in the men's room of Jack's
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:36.560]   crocodile bar. Of ordering food for myself to be delivered to your table.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:41.760]   Now, let me tell you, you may have seen the TV version of this, which is great. You may have read
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:47.680]   the novel, but you have not experienced American Gods till you've listened to this. And just imagine,
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:54.480]   you know, lying in bed and listening to this, it's a movie and your brain is a better, makes a better
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:48:01.200]   set, it's better everything than any movie can be. It comes to life. You are there in that
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:08.400]   alligator bar. You are there. It is amazing. I agree with you 100%. That's one of my favorites.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.800]   All the Neil Gaiman stuff is good. And by the way, many of Neil Gaiman's body
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:19.120]   books, he reads himself, which it turns out he's a very good reader. But there are here's the BBC
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:26.320]   one. You're talking about BBC. BBC did Neverware. And Christopher Lee, James McAvoy, Natalie Dormer,
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:32.720]   David Harwood, Benedict Cumberbatch is in it. And this is the key to cannabis.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:39.040]   Oh, I can't stay there. I'll move you on. We'll take you in. Trust me, I knew.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:44.240]   Oh, no, no, no, I'm not begging. I just came out for there. It's my leaving party in there, you see.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.960]   Yeah, again, the best possible experience. This is why you've got to join Audible. I'm just saying,
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:57.600]   you see, I have two credits. I know. And I always look forward to credit day at Audible. It's on
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.920]   the 22nd of every month. What am I going to listen to next? What are you waiting?
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:09.280]   I give you an Audible hack. Yeah. So first, thank you. Welcome back, Audible. Thank God you're here.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:14.240]   Second, the reason I'm Audible and have been is because of Leo and the commercials here. Oh, good.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:21.040]   Which got me all enthusiastic. So it was my newtch noch studio. My newtch is by the Zechlacht.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.560]   I saw I want to learn my German again. I'm so bad at it. I decided. So Pimsler is a wonderful
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:32.000]   language course. I love it half hour a day. I've been doing an hour a day. And I was doing Spanish
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.320]   in the car. But for reasons I want to do German now. But it's expensive. It's like, I know. It's
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:44.400]   20 some bucks for every five lessons. And there's five levels with 30 lessons each. And then and
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:51.360]   so if you buy it straight out, it's $550. And I was about to do that. And I went to Audible.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:56.000]   And I saw that if I switched my plan, I was on the Audible Premium Plus plan getting a credit a month.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:03.360]   I switched to the Audible Premium Plus annual with 24 credits. Oh, yeah. Instead of so I got
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:12.480]   the entirety of the Pimsler program in German for $229. Good deal. Now then, Bob,
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:19.440]   use my whole year just on Pimsler. I'll add to your hack. There's another select place where you
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:25.280]   can get a lot of college courses. It's called the great courses. I get the catalog could be really
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.480]   expensive. They've got the great courses on Audible. So we've talked before about John McWhorter. He
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:36.080]   wrote the, what is it? Our bastard tongue, a bastard English talking back talking black.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:43.040]   He is a lecturer and he does the story of human language among others in the great courses series.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:48.160]   I've been listening to this. So if you ever thought, Oh, it'll be really fun to study with Professor
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:54.960]   McWhorter because he's one of the great linguists alive. He's at the Manhattan Institute. You can go
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:00.400]   and listen to these lectures right here on Audible. This is the thing is it's more than just audiobooks.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:07.040]   It's all sorts of stuff. Einstein's relativity in the quantum revolution, modern physics
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:14.080]   for non scientists, the history of the medieval world building a better vocabulary. I wish,
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:21.040]   honestly, my life is too short. There's too much good stuff. I just, I want to listen to it all.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:27.840]   And it's all available to you right now at audible.com/twig or text twig to 500 500.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:33.120]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E audible.com/twig. It's really a way to get more out of life because while you're
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:39.600]   doing other stuff, you know, raking leaves, washing dishes, walking the dog, you can listen to audible
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:47.280]   and expand your whole world. I think it's the single most valuable thing that I've ever done.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:55.040]   And I'm really glad to have back as a sponsor called audible.com/twig or text twig to 500 500.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:00.880]   Gee, I wonder if Apple had a good quarter this year. How could we find that out?
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:12.240]   Let me tell you, Apple had an astonishing quarter, this quarter. CNBC calls it a blowout quarter.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:19.120]   Their sales for the, this is their second quarter of their fiscal year, just so you know,
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:28.640]   they're on not a calendar fiscal year. Their sales were 89.6 billion, which is 54% from the same period
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:39.120]   in 2020, driven by device sales. iPad and Mac sales nearly doubled. This is possible partly
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:44.880]   because COVID people have been buying computers left and right. They also, for the first time in
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:53.280]   a long time, have boosted their profit margins to 42%. Profit margins are the magic of any financial,
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:53:00.960]   I don't know, it's profit. And Apple has done a really good job. Their margins are exceptional
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:09.360]   for a hardware company at 42, at 38%, they were great at 42%. 42%, holy cow.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:15.520]   It's like they don't actually have to make physical devices. But do you. And then the other thing
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:23.120]   worth noting is their service revenue was 16.9 billion, which is about 19% of their total revenue.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:28.960]   And we were like, not even a year ago, we're like, oh, Apple really needs to get into services.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:33.280]   And they're like, okay, sure, we'll do it. And holy cow, they're doing all right there.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:38.320]   And that's where I'm going to assume a lot of their profit margins are coming from that in the
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:43.760]   freaking expensive $1,000 iPhone. I'm sure the gross margin went up because of services for sure.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.640]   Yeah. They are, by the way, we said Google was doing 50 billion in stock buybacks. Apple's going
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:55.120]   to do 90 billion. Yes. And what's, do we know what Apple's current stock cash on hand is versus
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:59.040]   Google's? I'm going to lift it up. It was well over 200 billion last I checked. I'm sure I don't
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:03.760]   know what it is currently. I could probably find that for you. They're spending it down.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:10.320]   But with revenue growing at that rate, you got to spend it fast to keep up.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:22.080]   That's incredible. 17.73 billion dollars in China alone. I mean, it is max sales up 70%.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:27.040]   You know what else is up? Dogecoin.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:31.120]   Yeah. Yeah. I know Jim Ruby loves that.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:38.640]   Elon Musk and Mark Cuban. I think Elon's doing this just to see what he can, what he can do
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:45.440]   with tweets. He just loves the power. Dogecoin, which was created as a joke, cryptocurrency, a meme,
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:55.440]   the doge meme, a Shiba Ibu. Thanks to tweets from Musk and Mark Cuban saying,
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:01.600]   what did Elon Musk say? He had a funny little tweet. He said, he calls himself the doge father.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:07.040]   He's also mentioning he's going to be on Saturday at live on May 8th. The doge father.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.560]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's by the way.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:17.040]   As I've said before, it just proves you don't have to be funny to be on Saturday not live. That's all.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:20.480]   I guess we've known that all along, haven't we?
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:27.280]   Mark Cuban tweets because doge is the one coin that people actually use for transactions.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.480]   We take many others via BitPay, but people spend their doge.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:36.480]   And that means more businesses will start taking it. The greatest inhibitor to its growth
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:43.280]   is you can't spend the doge you buy on Robinhood. That's why he likes dogecoin.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:49.520]   Oh my gosh. You could have magical speculation in cryptocurrency markets,
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.240]   fueling massive speculation in the stock market.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.840]   Oh, now you know why GameStop?
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:02.720]   Well, GameStop wasn't fueled by Bitcoin or crypto. It was just fueled by bored people with
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:09.840]   stimulus payments. I think there was a correlation between the stocks folks on that.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:13.520]   Well, I thought it was just they're like, I'm bored. Let's make some fast cash.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:19.920]   And that differs from the Bitcoin investors. How? No, I'm saying that's the correlation.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:26.000]   I'm not saying they were there was a direct link. So what is the let's see what the current doge
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.880]   price is. I'm just curious. 31 cents. Oh, it's not that high. How much did Father Robert have?
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:40.160]   Well, he started it like four millions. Father Robert had millions, but he sold them for a thousand
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:45.760]   bucks total. He could have had maybe several hundred thousand. Well, that's I mean,
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:51.600]   welcome to crypto. Right. But just over just in a month or go, it was roughly a nickel.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:59.840]   Yeah, big jump. Yeah. Amazon has said it's going to raise wages for half a million workers
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:08.880]   between 50 cents and three dollars an hour. That's you know, they were at 15. So the federal minimum
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:16.000]   wages $7.25 an hour. Amazon gets a lot of heat. I think this is one way they're responding to that
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.080]   heat to say, no, not only do we pay our employees, well, we're going to pay them even better.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.360]   It'll spend more than a billion dollars on incremental pay for those workers.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:28.800]   So I think, you know, we talk a lot about Amazon and being not a great employer, etc. I
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:32.880]   think it's important to also mention that they are going to give everybody a big raise.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:40.320]   Let's see. That was our money segment. I think that's sort of par for the course from a,
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:44.240]   it's okay. You can call me your point. You can call me your money, honey. Go ahead. I know you
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:48.160]   must. I will not be calling that. Okay.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:57.840]   Moot has left Google. I had questions about this. I didn't even know this Moot person was there.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:02.160]   Who or what is a Moot? We reported it. If you'd listened religiously,
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.520]   as is which is the only way to listen to twig. You would have known
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:10.800]   Chris Poole. I have my sacrament right here. Yes. Yes, that's right. You've got to be on your
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:17.680]   knees while you listen. Chris Poole who founded 4chan, left 4chan, came to Google. He was there five
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:25.440]   years. He held several roles, including starting its at its social media arm. I guess that's Google
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:32.080]   Plus. CNBC isn't clear. Eventually taking a role in Google Maps. His last official day was
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:39.360]   April 13th. He has not responded to requests for comments nor what Moot means.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:50.560]   Any mention of how many shares he has? Oh, he sold the 4chan for an undisclosed amount to a
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:59.920]   Japanese entrepreneur. But... Was he 15 years old? He was a kid. He started.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:08.160]   Yeah, he was a kid. That was in 2003. He's a little older now, but the boy genius of the
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:16.240]   underground. Anyway, so much for that. It was actually fairly controversial. The reason I
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:20.800]   remember it is when Google hired him. 4chan does not have the cleanest reputation.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:27.360]   4chan is not as bad as it. It's always been bad, but it doesn't seem as bad when you compare it to 8chan.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.320]   It's some anchoring going on here. Is that what you call that anchoring?
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:40.800]   Well, in pricing, it's anchoring when you set a super high price and then a low price and a medium
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:47.440]   price. I get it. When you anchor it, this is what something costs. This is how decent a site should
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:53.600]   be. The freakinomics thing where you set a low price, but you don't expect anybody to buy that
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:59.760]   at that price, the anchor. That's why Apple always says "starts" at $9.99. But if we really want to make
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:06.880]   that profit, you ought to buy the $2,500. You've got to buy a miniscule amount of storage.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:13.680]   $2,399 for the top of the line iPad. That's where your 42% profit margin comes from.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.320]   God, for an iPad, that's before you get the keyboard, which is $350.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:26.160]   That thing is crazy expensive, but I'll admit I would love to have one as a reference display for
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:32.560]   editing. Because it's the mini LED, which is a new display technology that's
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:39.520]   reputedly very good. It's P3 gamut and it's got very wide color dynamic range, high dynamic range.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.920]   I would love that compared to what those things normally cost. They're normally like
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:50.080]   $6,000. That's a reference display. It's only 12.9 inches, but it's still a reference. It's very
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.960]   accurate. The only reason I get it is maybe if I could do all my photo processing on it.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:01.280]   I don't know. I'm going to have to decide by 5am on Friday. I got you back.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.320]   You're just going to buy it, except it.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:09.600]   I mean, come on. Don't fight the feeling. Just roll with it.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:16.000]   She's saying she knows you. Well, it is. I mean, I don't need, I have last year's iPad. I don't
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.640]   need another iPad. No one, in fact, you certainly do not. It is probably the case. No one ever
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.520]   needs an iPad, right? I would need one. You're screaming. I think it's important to test the
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.920]   technology. God, thank you. Bless you, Stacey. I take back everything I said about you.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:36.080]   I think I need an iPad. Oh, yeah, that's right. In my hearing. No, I always say nice things about
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.560]   you. What's that you got? I have, I think this is the sixth gen. This isn't a pro.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.960]   The reason I don't use it. Look at those vessels.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.240]   I don't even use it. It's just, it's underpowered. Yeah.
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.960]   And I just don't have a reason to use it. I use it to read that Washington Post stuff or every
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.640]   now and then some other online consumption. But I would love to process more on it. But it's just
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:05.360]   not powerful enough. And yeah, I would like to have a pro, but man, they are super expensive. Yeah.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:12.800]   You can usually do trade-ins. I know Kevin, he has a pro and he loves it. And he's looking at
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:19.120]   the trade-in values. So as long as Apple doesn't switch out the chips, you're fine.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:26.560]   Scooter X in our chatroom is just trying to drive me nuts. He's saying he's basically typing the
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:33.440]   specs in 2D backlighting system with 2596 full array local dimming zones, 2732 by 2048 pixel
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:39.200]   resolution at 264 pixels per inch. Pro-motion technology, wide color display, p3, two tone display.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:48.720]   Scooter X, stop it. So sold. Yeah, probably buy one. Five am, I have to get up because I'm sure
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:59.440]   they'll be in short supply. Yeah. Want to talk base camp? Yes. What was this? I always saw
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:08.080]   was the headline. Fun names. What was that all about? Fun names. So there was a reckoning at
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:14.080]   base camp where they have been keeping a list of fun names and they're evidently, I guess,
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:18.960]   offensive enough that people wouldn't even tell anybody what they were. So first explain what base
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:25.680]   camp is. You better explain that. So I'm actually fairly familiar with it because the guys who
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.920]   founded it, Jason Freed and David Hennemeyer-Hanson, are really great guys, very smart.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   They created, I think some of the earliest web 2.0 software, there's software as an
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:46.160]   Apple as a service that was running off the web. DHH wrote Ruby on Rails, he's very well known for
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:53.920]   that. And Jason Freed has written a number of books, including rework, which you wrote about 10 years
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:04:02.320]   ago, about doing innovative new companies for the 21st century, things like that. It was originally
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:07.920]   called 37 Signals. You might remember it as 37 Signals. They renamed it after their biggest
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:15.920]   product, which is called Base Camp. Base Camp is basically a web-based project management system.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:25.280]   A lot of companies use it very popular. So these are people who created accounts on Base Camp.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:30.480]   By the way, Base Camp had a very generous free trial. So probably a lot of these are free trial.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:37.520]   So apparently some of the names were kind of like the names you'd hear. Bart Simpson prank
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:42.000]   mowed the bartender with on the Simpsons, right? I'm looking for a Hug and Kiss,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   Amanda Hug and Kiss. I'm looking for Amanda Hug and Kiss. Get it? Or Seymour Butts, is there a...
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.960]   IP freely. Yeah, you know. So they...
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.120]   But some also evidently made fun of the Southern cultures. They were racist.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:07.360]   Yeah. Yes. Well, let's back up for a second here. So what we see first is the founders of Base
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:14.640]   Camp. The boss is saying new rules. A few points. One, there'll be no more societal and political
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:20.480]   discussions at our company on Base Camp account, period. Number two, no more paternalistic
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.200]   benefits. We're not going to nudge you. We're going to give you a raise to make up for it.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.880]   You're not getting anything like that. Number three, no more committees, period, none.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.160]   Number four, no lingering. And I should point out that dwelling. Again, freed is a thought leader
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:38.720]   in new ways of working. That's a stick. He's famous for that. So this has an even... Yeah,
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:44.480]   might be a stick. It is even more... And again, I have interviewed Jason and David, both on
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.800]   our shows on triangulation, especially. And I have a lot of respect for them. But go ahead.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:55.680]   So real quick list, no more lingering or dwelling on past decisions, no more 360 reviews.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.360]   No forgetting what we do here. All right. So it was a very Jason-free kind of,
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:06.240]   this is the way we work and I'm going to change the world and that. Well, Casey Newton, it's
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:12.960]   really, really good reporting on this. And this is on his, by the way, brand new platformer, Casey.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:19.760]   Yes. Left, was it Vox or the Verge? I can't remember to go solo to become, as Stacy would say,
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.560]   a sovereign writer. Sovereign writer.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:29.600]   What to be? If you want to be a Casey Newton, then DM me so you can come in here, Stacy and Andrew,
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.120]   explain how you... There you go. Be the next Casey. You could be. So,
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:39.600]   turns out, this is to the point now of this list, that this list resurfaced and there was a
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:43.760]   diversity committee and there... Nobody would talk about these names, by the way. Nobody knows
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.200]   what the names were. They were so bad. Nobody would even utter them.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:53.840]   So what turns out was there were people, there were employees who were trying to have as many
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.080]   organizations, including my own right now, are trying to have right now as a racial reckoning
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:02.800]   and trying to have the proverbial difficult conversations everybody says they're going to
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:08.480]   have and don't have. But, and they were having discussions on the internal tools and they had
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:14.000]   a committee about this kind of stuff and people were very interested and then, boom, stops because
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.280]   of that note saying, "Oh, we have new ways to operate here, no politics." Now, to me, to say that a
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:23.920]   company isn't political is like people saying the technology is neutral. It's not. Companies are
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.360]   political. What you choose to do is a company. What you choose to be there is political by its
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:31.840]   nature. You need to be able to discuss these things, especially today in America. You've got
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:37.440]   to be able to discuss race. Is it political? Yeah. And it's also core to the society and where we
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:43.360]   are and how we reckon with it. So, Casey did what I think really good reporting with current and
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:49.680]   former unnamed employees, anonymous sources, going through this and comparing it to Coinbase,
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:53.440]   where the same kind of thing happened. They banned internal political discussions.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.200]   Well, when that happens, it's probably because they don't want uncomfortable conversations.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:03.200]   And so, what this comes out is it looks like, "Oh, this is the really cool company getting rid
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:07.440]   of 360 review and committees are so boring." And yeah, politics gets people in trouble,
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.000]   "Let's not do that." Well, actually said Casey, it may be that they are trying to steam roll
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.560]   over the problems that they should be dealing with. So, I found this to be just a fascinating
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.880]   one-two punch. I read the Basecamp post first thinking, "Okay, more from Jason. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:28.720]   yeah." And then to get the backstory from Casey was really good work. Is it the backstory or is
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:34.720]   it just Casey's? I don't, I disagree with you. It looks more like Casey's gloss on it without
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.640]   actually any direct experience. Well, he interviewed employees.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.240]   Yeah. I mean, that's how Casey didn't work there. People were talking about quitting.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:50.880]   Okay. So, I think the issue, there's, and this is tough. This is worth talking about simply
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:59.760]   because it's tough and it's common in many organizations. It's how democratic can a company be.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.280]   Well, we know this one isn't. It is not an democracy here at Twig. We know that.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.280]   Maybe, maybe that's why I'm sympathetic. He is banning gifts on his internal
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:14.560]   slap. Maybe that's why I'm sympathetic to Jason. His thought might be, "You know what? This is an
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.200]   internal, I don't know if it was, it wasn't slack, it's slack like it's Basecamp. But this is an
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:25.840]   internal, this place for doing, we're here to conduct business. Get work done.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:33.760]   This is not for, if you have a racist experience at work, that part of the book.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.560]   That's what you've got to absolutely. But should it be discussed at Basecamp or should you go to HR
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.920]   and say that dick is a racist? I mean, well, so when it's your company culture, I mean,
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:51.840]   if the company culture is to have a broad, have a set of basically a racist meme, let's just call
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.760]   the list a racist meme that people have been contributing to for years and you're like,
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.640]   "Hey, this isn't cool." And they recognize that. They were like, "That isn't cool. Let's take it down."
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:08.640]   But as people pointed out in Casey's story, also outside of this list, is if you're talking about
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:16.880]   things like compensation on the site, if your compensation is basically built on tenure there
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:22.000]   and everybody who's there is white in mail because they're just tackling diversity issues,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:29.200]   then you have to talk about these things as part of business. And maybe it's something about focus
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:35.440]   groups that you're trying to, it features in software. Black people really hate something
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.160]   about our software. I don't know. I'm just making things up. You have to be able to talk about that.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:49.680]   And I think the big uproar, and I think what's hard and what we're going to be dealing with
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.000]   for decades to come, and I think it's going to be painful but really important is
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:02.320]   we have lived forever in a society that is inherently racist and we don't always recognize
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:07.040]   those things. And when people pointed out to us, it's really uncomfortable because no one wants to
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:14.640]   - most of us don't want to be a jerk. And so when you start talking about that in work,
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:20.800]   some people are going to be uncomfortable. And you can always point out, hey, well,
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.720]   maybe everybody else has been uncomfortable this whole time and they just didn't, they couldn't
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:31.680]   talk about it and so now they are. But it's still hard to get your work done and also be made to
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:38.640]   feel bad. And this is going to be a dynamic that we're going to have to deal with. And Jason basically
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:44.400]   is saying, we're going to not have these conversations as a way to not deal with it,
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:49.840]   which I think is reflexively what many people will want to do. But it's not the right thing to do,
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:55.680]   and it's not going to help us address all of this. And I think this is gathering so much speed
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.480]   because this is a microcosm of literally everything we're having to talk about and go through
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.880]   in America today. And I think that's great, but it is hard. Okay, that was my Stacy gets really
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:14.000]   sincere. No, and I think that's a really good point. I think what you're seeing is that Jason
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.360]   and David who, you know, look at the end of the article, it says, and I think this is true,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:28.960]   basically, base camp exists as Jason and David's kind of basically exists for David and Jason's
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.560]   enjoyment when employee told me at the end of the day, if they're not interested in seeing things in
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:37.280]   their work timeline that make them uncomfortable, it distracts them from what they're interested in.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.800]   And this is the culmination of that. And so I understand, I mean, that's kind of how
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:46.320]   Lisa and I friend this company, it's for our enjoyment. Small company, especially that's kind
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:53.440]   of not unusual. But you make an excellent point that there has to be somewhere, if people are
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.840]   uncomfortable and there are things going on that make people feel uncomfortable, that has to be
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:04.320]   similar to discuss that. So here's what Casey wrote, interviews with the half dozen base
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.600]   camp employees over the past day, being a portrait of a company where workers sought to
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.920]   advance base camps commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, by having sensitive discussions
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.400]   about the company's own failures. After months of frauds conversations, Frieden, his co-founder
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:23.200]   moved to shut those conversations off. And there was a DEI committee, there was a DEI
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.040]   council that attracted significant support, more to the third of the company, 20 out of 58
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:31.120]   employees volunteered to help. They began examining base camps hiring processors,
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:36.960]   processes, how base camp employees socialize, what speakers they might invent to all
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:42.960]   remote events and such. But in the aftermath of these discussions, employees began to discuss
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.960]   the list of the customer names. That's when it got uncomfortable and that's when they shut it off.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.360]   That's a problem. And to act like this is forward thinking company,
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.440]   when that's what's happening, that's not transparent. And that's not really dealing with the issues
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:03.680]   you should deal with. That's my view. And it's really a shame because people do. Oh, go ahead.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:11.360]   I do agree with the point that these conversations should be had. And it's I think it's good to have
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:18.480]   them in a private HR setting, if you will. But if that doesn't happen, then yet that's when you
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:25.120]   take it to the big board, at a general, would it be okay if to get her if they said, all right,
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:29.760]   we're going to set up an area of base camp that's for these conversations, but we'd like to segregate
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.680]   that from the area where we're, you know, we're trying to get work done and try to make this
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:41.120]   business run, but still have those conversations. We'll run a business. I think the point you might
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:48.800]   be thinking about is, can you run a business today without running into, let's say, systemic
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:55.280]   racism and sexism? And many people would argue that you can't. We think we can because we've done
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:02.880]   it. No, I understand. But what I don't, but I think is probably unproductive and it might hurt
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:09.520]   the business of the business is that there's disagreement. You know, any time you're going to
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:15.760]   have a political discussion among any group of people bigger than five, it's not politics to say,
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:23.200]   hey, we should be recognized. I'm sorry, systemic racism isn't politics. No, no, no, no. But I understand
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:27.520]   what the conversation is like. You would say that, what you agree with and say, you know, I with
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.560]   and then somebody's going to say, no, you're full of it. I that we this and then and somebody else
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:36.560]   can say, no, no, you guys are crazy. And then they're you're going to get this battling going on in
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:40.560]   this message. So if you talk about it from that, sure, if you say, but if you're, I mean, these
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:46.480]   conversations come up, like, I'll just tell you, I had a conversation with my editor at IEEE at one
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:53.040]   point. And I had brought up using smart home products as, you know, people using them for domestic
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:16:00.800]   violence, right as a coercive tool in domestic violence. And that was not the point of the article.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:06.720]   The point was something related, but not that. But I focused on that. And he was like, Oh, man,
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:13.440]   they're going to hate this. And I was like, why? You know, in these, these are the kind of things,
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.600]   like, so we had this back and forth that he was fine with it. He's like 27 years old. And he's
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:21.040]   like, of course, we should be talking about this. But you know, the old guard doesn't like it.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:26.800]   But but that's a conversation to you and the editor. Yes, but if you put that in the public
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:33.040]   group and had 20 other people weighing in on it, I think that's okay. And you can always have
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.880]   someone say, all right, this is done moving on. I mean, well, I think that's kind of what Jason said.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:46.480]   Well, sorry, you can't say this is done forever moving on when it's like, you can say, Hey, I don't
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.720]   think we're having a productive conversation now. And I think this is a skill people need to learn.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:57.200]   Right. We can have these conversations, but we can choose a different forum forum.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.520]   Did that come out right? Yeah.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:05.120]   If we're going to talk about operations, let's talk about operations. If we're going to talk about
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:11.200]   some issues, let's talk about these issues over here in private eye to eye and get this stuff
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:15.280]   hashed out so we can get back to operations and make it money. Yes.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:22.320]   I also think there's value in doing it in a public forum because it allows people, if you can keep
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:30.960]   it civil, it allows people to be exposed to other people like I sat in a meeting where the
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:38.800]   top editors made fun of microaggressions. See, that's why I say a separate forum,
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:44.880]   because I've never seen it be civil in a big group. It always devolves into a bunch of
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:50.880]   fingerpoint and misunderstandings. And then it's always out of context because things are written,
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.080]   so you don't know the tone that is written. So yeah, the right way to handle this might be say,
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.120]   look, this is not a forum for this. Let's have a company meeting,
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.120]   get a bring in a facilitator. We sit down. Let's all this.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.040]   Facilitator needs to be there. Otherwise, that's the part of the problem with the
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:12.560]   online forum is there's no facilitator. And we need to hash this out. And yes, you're right. This
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:17.120]   is an issue we have to address as a company. And we as the owners and managers have to address.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:21.200]   But this may not be the perfect forum for it. That would be an appropriate reaction, I think.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.640]   To shut it down and say, no, no, we're not going to talk about that. That's dysfunctional.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:31.680]   Yeah, that's wrong. That's just dysfunctional. That's a lot of families, a lot of groups do that.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.760]   Yeah, we're not going to talk. We don't want to talk about it. And that's not going to help
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:42.560]   an organization of any kind. But so yeah, maybe this is a little on their part.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.720]   This is kind of a knee jerk reaction to I don't want to hear this anymore. And that's a little
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:51.520]   dysfunctional. I think maybe you're right. I just feel like I don't know if Casey Newton is going
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:59.760]   to get the actual, I guess somebody has to do this work. But it seems like an internal company matter.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:05.120]   Maybe not. Well, except for Jason Freed is until he made a big announcement.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.280]   Yeah, well, he just put it on the plot. But he's also someone that literally people look to
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:16.960]   understand and deal with what's true. It's true. Yeah. Yes. And he's worth profiling for that reason
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:24.000]   alone. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. And it's a very outspoken. He's outspoken and the company's
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.640]   outspoken about this stuff. Yeah. Yeah, it's unlikely that someone would take my internal memos and
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:34.240]   post them. I'm going to buy post to them. But if they would be talking about it because
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:39.200]   no one cares what's Daisy Higginbotham is doing on her workforce.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:44.320]   It's an interesting story. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I'll come around and say,
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:51.040]   you know, my initial reaction might be the same if this kind of stuff happened in our internal
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:56.240]   slack at Twid. But I think you're right. If this stuff comes up. I think your point at the end was
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.400]   right. You have those dresses. All right. But the thing is, you'll think, well, we should,
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:04.880]   there are ways to deal with it. Right. That's the thing I've seen you and
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:10.800]   Mrs. LaPort say in meetings, hey, let's have a discussion over here. Yeah. And that's the right
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:14.640]   way to handle it. If something comes up, you all have been very blunt about saying,
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:19.600]   come to us and let's talk to let's talk about this. You know, you're both. I mean,
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.240]   that's part of the problem with business is you want to get the job done of the business.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:30.240]   And it's really easy to get sidetracked on these admittedly important conversations,
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:36.320]   but to the point where the job stops getting done, then then the business is going to collapse.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:41.600]   So you got to get me wrong. I'm with you on that because I enjoy having my bills paid, you know,
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.480]   but at the same time, if there's a problem, I want us to hash out the problems and I'll,
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:52.560]   I'm bold enough to come to you directly in private, not with any disrespect to say,
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:58.560]   hey, this is an issue. Let's, let's address it, please. I think our, our tricaster is crashed.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.960]   We're stuck on the same shot. Sorry. Yeah, I had issues with it this morning. Yeah.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:07.600]   Reboot tricaster this morning. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes we get in that situation. I'm looking at the,
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:13.600]   I'll take this opportunity to look at the stage in the club to it discord and remind everybody.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:18.000]   This is where we're going to take audience feedback. I love it. This is where the, this is where we
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:26.880]   take audience feedback. If you have anything you want to say to me, raise your hand.
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:33.760]   I hope you have on your own. Raise your hand. Raise your hand. I should, I'll take this opportunity
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:38.720]   to mention that we have a now a club to it, which is pretty exciting. And it's been going really
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:44.800]   well beyond my expectations. A lot of people had said to us, you know, we don't, there's too
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:51.200]   many ads or more likely people say, I don't mind the ads, but I don't want any ad tracking. And
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:56.720]   this is kind of everybody agrees. We don't want to add tracking. But advertisers love ad tracking,
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.280]   and they've kind of been pushing us in that direction a little bit. We use services like
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:05.760]   Charitable and pod sites that we think are non-intrusive. They aren't the same kind of tracking that,
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:09.920]   you know, is happening on the web. But at the same time, there are people don't want that. So we
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:17.600]   decide we should offer a way of supporting to it without ads, an ad-free version of our podcast
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:23.360]   network. And that's called Club Twit. For $7 a month, you get ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:31.920]   In fact, this ad will be cut out of the Club Twit version of the show. But, and it was kind of an
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.920]   unexpected benefit. We also decided besides the ad-free versions, we thought that's the chief
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:41.760]   benefit of this. No ads means no tracking. You get a feed that's just for you, that's just,
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:46.880]   you know, the shows with no ads. We also thought we should set up a Discord server. Discord is a
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:54.000]   very popular chat platform, originally for gaming, now widely used by a variety of communities.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.520]   It's become an amazing community that we've really had fun doing shows and doing other stuff.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:04.400]   And so that's another benefit you get to participate in our Club Twit Discord.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:09.120]   You also get an additional feed that's not available anywhere else. That's the Twit Plus feed.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:12.960]   And it's really just stuff that's on the cutting room floor, the discussions before and after shows,
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:19.760]   little shows that we're doing in the Discord. Lisa and I did an inside Twit last weekend.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:25.200]   We also did a Linux show on Saturday. We'll probably do that again this Saturday. Little things like that.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:33.440]   And those go in the Club Twit Plus feed. So all three, ad-free plus the Discord plus the Twit Plus feed,
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:40.080]   $7 a month. And if you want to know more, certainly no obligation, the beauty of this is nothing has
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.560]   changed. The free tier is exactly as it always has been. Everything we've always done for free is
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:50.640]   still available. And no one's going to look at you as scans if you don't pay the $7 a month.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:55.600]   It's just a feature for people who wanted it. Twit.tv/clubtwit,
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:05.120]   but I have to say we've been having a lot of fun in that Discord. I think you'll see it's well
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:09.600]   worth the $7 a month. Nobody has raised their hand, Stacey. You're lucky.
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:15.040]   Why am I lucky? Nobody wants to get into this conversation. All right.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:23.040]   YouTube is doing so well. I mean, we saw the quarterly results for YouTube on pace to bring in
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:33.360]   an annual revenue comparable to Netflix. That's kind of mind-boggling. And what a brilliant strategy
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:41.360]   to create a platform where you don't pay any money for the content. You just make money on the
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:50.560]   content. Revenue of $6 billion for the quarter. Like as I mentioned, almost 50% from the year before.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:25:01.120]   It's twice the growth rate of Netflix. Netflix has about $29.7 billion in revenue,
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:07.200]   or we'll have in 2021. YouTube will probably exceed that this year.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:13.840]   So what is that? I wonder what proportion of that is. Advertising what proportion of that is
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:20.400]   YouTube TV? Oh, they don't break that out. That's a good question. I really actually know what
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:26.080]   drives the business. Well, here's some numbers. YouTube users watch a billion hours of video,
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:33.680]   one billion hours of video every day. Netflix, 400 million. So it's more than twice.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:42.880]   Content consumption. Netflix spent $17 billion to create its content. Of course, they don't have
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:49.280]   ad revenue. They have subscriber revenue. YouTube does give some portion of its revenue back to
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.840]   the creators, but we don't know how much. So it isn't exactly free. It's tiny. I think it's pretty
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:02.240]   small. I can confirm that. Yeah. We've never made much money on YouTube either.
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:07.040]   It's interesting. I don't know if it means anything. In some ways, they're very different
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:13.120]   businesses, but it's still video entertainment on a screen. Just two different ways to look at it.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.160]   Unfortunately, if you use a Roku, you're not going to be too happy about the
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:21.920]   YouTube experience. And Roku says it may lose YouTube TV.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:30.320]   After Google has made some demands, it just doesn't want to live up to. It's just negotiation.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:33.280]   Yeah. This happens every time. I like how this is. Yeah. This is character.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:38.240]   Twitter about it. Yeah. Exactly. This is cable TV. This is the new cable TV. Welcome to it.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:43.120]   Roku says Google has asked Roku to do things. It does not see replicated on other streaming
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:48.640]   competitors platforms like creating a dedicated search results row for YouTube within the Roku
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:54.560]   TV smart interface, giving YouTube search results more prominent placement. Google has
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:27:00.000]   required it to block search results from other streaming content providers when users are using
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.800]   the YouTube app upon Roku's system. You can't recommend anything on a different channel.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:10.640]   Roku alleges Google has asked it to favor YouTube music results from voice commands made on the
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:18.400]   Roku remote. If the YouTube app is open, even if you set the preference to Pandora, if you say,
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:23.840]   play Barry White, it's going to play it on YouTube. That seems to read if you've got the app open,
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.280]   you know, Google has threatened to require Roku to use certain chipsets or memory cards.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:36.400]   It would force Roku to increase the price of its hardware. YouTube says, it's just a negotiation
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.880]   folks. We've been working with Roku in good faith to reach an agreement that benefits our
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.480]   viewers and their customers. Unfortunately, Roku. Oh, this is interesting, Jeff. Unfortunately,
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:51.840]   this is from YouTube TV. Roku often engages in these type of tactics in their negotiations.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:57.520]   We're disappointed that they chose to make baseless claims while we continue our ongoing
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:04.480]   negotiations. There'd be a mean to us when I was in the the edge of the business, when I worked for
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.920]   advance and they owned a cable company, people sent me down and say, this is how it works in the
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:15.200]   cable business. Just for the sport of it, they leave not one scrap of meat on the table.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:22.880]   Just for the sport of it. I have a little experience of this working for tech TV in the cable business.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:31.120]   It is a brutal, brutal business. It's not when this if this were to go down and YouTube doesn't end
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:37.520]   up on that platform, who's the winner there? You do exactly nobody. And the and the and the
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.120]   biggest losers are we the viewers. The viewers. Yeah.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:50.000]   Do we want to cover these Facebook stories? Facebook stopped employees from reading an internal
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:56.560]   report about its role in the insurrection. Buzzfeed news. They got out of anyway.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:08.480]   Comic is unapologetic about putting garlic on fans shopping lists. I just found this in music.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:14.560]   Mike trap. It has come to my attention that some of you have had garlic added to your online
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:21.600]   shopping cart while watching the latest um, actually near an Amazon device. At the time I was
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:27.200]   hilariously trying to use voice commands to make Mike Drucker's echo by groceries he didn't want.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:31.840]   Well, this was obviously very funny during the filming and never dreamed it would affect our
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:39.520]   viewers in the final gut and thus become even funnier as a comedian. I'm a sometimes experiment
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:44.560]   with bits that it may not work. And in this particular case, I knocked it out of the F and park.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:51.120]   Nevertheless, some of you may not want garlic added to your order, even though you never really
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:57.280]   can have too much garlic. True that probably low anyway. To these viewers, I'm sorry for the
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:03.280]   inconvenience and only ask that you consider what a gosh darn hoot this is. I'll try to do better
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:08.880]   in the future, but it'll be hard because this is the best to which I respond.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:19.600]   Add garlic to my shopping list. You could have picked a different thing. No, but I think he has a
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:25.840]   very good point. You can always have more garlic. Okay. All right. All right. By the way, I actually
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:28.400]   write hand rate garlic on our shopping list every week.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:36.160]   Well, it's not a terrible thing because garlic's relatively inexpensive. It's cheap and it doesn't
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:44.720]   last for us. I actually bought on Amazon a garlic keeper because I was so unhappy with the state of
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:50.480]   our garlic. So there, you know what I need now? Maybe you can make a recommendation stay. So you
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:57.520]   seem to have kitchen sense. I need a basket to hang the onions and the shallots in.
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:04.320]   You're a preacher, but I'm in a basket. Well, we put them on right now. We're putting them on a
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:12.560]   counter. I want something that just and time ever. I have a bread basket that I just stick them in.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:18.560]   Is that what you do? I feel like it needs air. It needs air. That's why I have a garlic keeper.
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:23.200]   It needs like a mesh of something. Yeah. And you should never store your onions and garlic
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:27.440]   near your potatoes, by the way. Uh huh. My point exactly. Oh, I found it.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:34.880]   A three tier hanging basket fruit organizer. Heavy duty wire organizer with some.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:40.480]   I wouldn't put your garlic. You're gonna hang that. Just stick a basket inside your freaking pantry.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:47.280]   No, but if you're hanging, it's in the air and it can circulate. It keeps the vampires away.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:53.520]   So my basket, it's this is like a basket. And then at the bottom, there's a little ridge. Yeah.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:32:02.160]   So the onions are off in the air. In the basket circulates the air. I mean, you do you, man, but
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:09.280]   I mean, unless you'd like really want a hanging basket. Put garlic on my shopping list.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:18.640]   Put a hanging basket on my shopping list. Burger King's new ad forces Google home to advertise.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:25.040]   This is old. How did this go? The list is because I put it in there because it was a
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:30.000]   greatest hits of putting things on people's shopping list. That was the classic. They got a lot of trouble
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.320]   for that. Okay. That was relative trouble. Yeah. I mean, it's not like they went to jail or they
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:40.720]   got fined or anything, but people sure shook their fists in the air at them.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:49.520]   Let's do a Google change log. What do you say? Play the drums.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:55.280]   Oh, no, try caster.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:06.320]   Try to order some more ram. The chat room is so mad at me.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:22.800]   Google adds COVID restriction alerts, new road trip mapping features as vaccines enable safer
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:28.320]   travel. So this is actually really good. If you search for hotels in Toronto,
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:34.560]   this is an example from nine to five Google, you will see a big pop up that says quarantine for
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:42.400]   14 days required after entry. And then there's even a checkbox that says receive an email if this
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:48.400]   guidance changes. Canada's really cracking down on to travel to Canada. So that would be a very
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:53.360]   good thing to know. These are all for those in the US who were interested in taking a trip
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:02.400]   after staying home for the last year. You can also, let's see here, you can also
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:08.480]   in the explore tab on its travel site, instead of just showing flights, the page will now show
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:15.600]   places you can get to by car because it's obviously a little safer to go by car during the pandemic.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:22.320]   You can tell it flights only if you prefer, but it's nice to have that as a addition.
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:28.800]   You'll see more destinations on the map too, including smaller cities in national parks.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:35.280]   So, and you can filter that as well, but some more ideas of places you can go as you plan your
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:42.320]   road trip. And finally, they're adding more features for road trips. Oh, that's the more features for
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:52.000]   road trips. Google does say travel demand is growing considerably. In April 2021, the company
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.480]   says searches for hotels were at the highest they've been in the last 10 years. But at the same time,
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:04.800]   searches for quote travel restrictions by country were also at an all time high, which is one reason.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:09.600]   If we don't help the world, we're not going anywhere. We might might get back into a gosh,
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:14.240]   so sad if we had to go back inside after all that.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:19.920]   It was hot out today, you know, I was I was thinking I'm not ready for summer and heat. I was
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:23.200]   thinking it's kind of okay to sit inside all of that. I was fine with that.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:27.840]   I think we've modified, you know, poor. We did what we did was weekly earlier in our host Paul
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:33.280]   Thorat. God is it was two weeks after a second shot. In fact, today's my two week mark.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:39.680]   Thank you. And I'm tempted to go out and kiss somebody kiss a stranger just to celebrate.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:47.360]   Just to get in trouble with my wife. But he went out to went to Boston, hung out with friends,
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.160]   went to bars and something came back with a horrific cold.
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:56.800]   It's like, boy, he's not a spring chicken either though, right? Well, but also if you don't,
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:01.120]   if you're not exposed to any germs for a whole year, yeah, that's what's going to happen.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:06.320]   Yeah. You take off the mask and don't wash your hands in suddenly you're going to get something.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:11.760]   Thank goodness is a cold. Yeah. I mean, it's not the end of the world, but he's really sad and bad,
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:18.960]   the poor guy. So maybe just stay away from people. How about have some whiskey, Mr. Thorat? Yeah.
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:24.000]   Good. Well, peanut butter whiskey fixes all that stuff. Oh, whiskey with honey and lemon.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:30.000]   Yeah. Sure. Tidy. That's my hot toddy of choice. Hot toddy. Get back in my body,
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:37.840]   a hot toddy. What whiskey do you like? Oh, for that, I just I just do whatever bourbon or whiskey
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:44.000]   whatever brown I have a Bainbridge Island whiskey. It's nice. I don't have bad whiskey.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:51.280]   If it's here, it's good. I've I discovered something in Safeway. They keep all the good stuff
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:57.360]   locked up by an encounter. You have to tell them. I want to know it was behind the counter.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.840]   There's some good whiskey back there. It's a whistle pig.
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:05.840]   Angels and range thing to have grocery stores. So booze. Do you don't do that in Jersey? You
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:11.600]   have to go to a box store. Well, a few, a few do. Yeah. In Texas, you don't either. That's right.
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:14.720]   It is weird. Yeah. Pack what they call package stores. Is that what they call it?
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.920]   Packaging store. I just call them liquor stores, but sure.
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:22.880]   Same thing in Canada. You have to go to a special place to get you. You just have to go to a beer
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:29.920]   store. Beer store. Yeah. No longer. Google Fi happy birthday. I didn't realize it was six years old
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:37.520]   this week. They have a new simply unlimited plan that lacks unlimited plus extras. Oh, what a way to
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:47.840]   celebrate. In the beginning, remember, Google Fi was simple. There was one plan. $20 gives you
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:53.120]   unlimited text and calling and then $10 for every gigabyte of data. That was it. That was it.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:59.840]   Then they interested in interested a couple of years ago, the bill protection thing.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:08.080]   That was for $80. Then a year later, in 2019, the unlimited plan for $70. Now,
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:15.200]   third new plan, simply unlimited data, although you're capped at 22 gigabytes.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:23.120]   Not really unlimited. Talking to. But you don't get the international. See, I've been paying for
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.360]   a Fi. One of the reasons I use Fi all this time is because it's great for international travel,
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.840]   but what a waste for the last year. Well, I've, but you can, you can pause it for three months at a
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:36.080]   time, which I really did. That's been a long time to see that. That's good. So this limits
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:43.440]   international data benefits to the US, Canada and Mexico and no tethering $60 a month for one user.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.600]   And as you add lines, it goes down $30 for every line when there are three or more members. So
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:55.440]   that's the simply, that's not complicated at all. Simply not unlimited plan. Simply limited until
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:04.800]   you get 22 gigabytes and then it's limited. So $60 per line per month. Yeah. That's a lot of money.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.120]   That's a lot more than we've been paying, right? Because we only pay, we only pay if we use data.
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:15.200]   So I don't, yeah. There's also a lot of people are raising their prices now. The post pandemic
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:21.440]   price, MacGhetton. Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Spotify is raising their prices, Procter and Gamble
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:27.840]   raising their prices. Lots of companies. Yeah. Spotify went up on the family plan, I believe.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:33.120]   Yeah. But it's only like a buck. A buck. That's how they start though. You know, it's a buck here,
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.640]   buck there. Well, I don't believe it. That's, that's how it works on the table.
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:46.080]   Also, they have $100 off on select phones to celebrate. We'll see if they have some new phones soon.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:52.960]   Yes. So we should talk about that because. Well, but is that change log or is that real?
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:40:02.160]   Oh, shoot darn it. No, I'm so easily distracted. Squirrel. Squirrel. I owe. I owe. You don't want
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.800]   because I really hate the change like it's so boring. Google run Android Earth. We go do it.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:13.840]   Because you, you somebody said I had to. It's not boring. It's not boring. Sometimes it's
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:18.800]   relevant information about Google delivered relatively quickly. We're doing it. Now we know
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:24.160]   who said you had to. We're doing it. Stacey. We're doing it because we call the stupid show this
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:29.360]   week in Google. So we got to have something in Google waiting in there. Yeah, as opposed to this
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.800]   weekend and Jeff and Stacy and Leo arguing. That's what it really is. This week in Discord.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:41.840]   Not, not with a capital D, a lower case. Google run Android earthquake alert system now providing
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:50.160]   warnings in first two countries. Drop cover and hold. Here comes an estimated 6.1
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:55.360]   earthquake 16 miles away. God, I don't want to get that announcement. I'd rather just be surprised.
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:00.720]   Now available in Greece and New Zealand.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:12.960]   There you have it. I guess we have it in California too. So wait a minute. I'm confused.
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:18.400]   They have the detection system has been live for the past few months in Northern California
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:28.640]   or in California. Oh, it's the US Geological Survey's Shake Alert system. Now available to
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:33.200]   Android users in Oregon as well as California. We'll roll out in Washington this May.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:41.920]   The big one comes you'll be carrying your iPhone. The detection system. See, the thing is that's
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:47.200]   really interesting to me is the the the sensors in these phones are sensitive enough to pick up
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:51.680]   the shaking. I guess though distinguishing between an earthquake. Oh, I know why because it would be
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:56.880]   me and John would both be shaking at the same time in the same way. Then you would say, oh, there
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:04.320]   might be an incident going on. Right? You're right. Well, it could just be tied to the fact that the
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:14.000]   USG whatever USGS Shake Alert said shake a bit out and then you check it out. I mean, we could
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.560]   all get together in a room and shake our phones a lot. That's true. But it seems like that there's
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:24.320]   a little too smart for that Stacey. They know. Well, so I actually just like literally before
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:28.240]   the show was talking to a company that provides sensors that measure earthquakes.
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:33.520]   They use highly sensitive accelerometers. You need them in two locations to do this.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:41.920]   There's actually pretty solid algorithms that you have to develop to figure out if it's an actual
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:47.760]   earthquake. What I'm guessing is since they don't get these alerts on your Android phone now in the
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:52.560]   US, but you can get an Al-Greece and a Zealand that are trying it out in Greece and New Zealand
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:43:02.080]   before they roll it out in the US. But Android owners will be able to opt out from settings,
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:08.640]   location, advanced earthquake alerts. It's in there. According to 9-5 Google,
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:13.600]   the detection system has been live for the past few months, but Google has not been using it to
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:19.600]   send alerts yet. Rather, those that looked up, quote, "Earthquake near me" in Google's search
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.280]   were asked if they felt shaking. Did you feel shaking? That's not what I want. If I search for
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:32.400]   earthquakes near me, do you feel something? Do you feel something? Yeah, that's how you get better.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:37.680]   Yeah. You're feeding the algorithm. Okay. So we don't have it yet. They do in Greece and New
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:44.960]   Zealand, but I'm guessing it's a small pilot just to see if it's safe. Get ready for three
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:49.520]   stories through the change log, folks. Oh, we're moving faster now though. Get ready for guacamole.
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:55.920]   One of the things I like about my Google Nest Hub Max, when I set a timer and it starts beeping at
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:00.000]   me, I can just shout, "Stop!" And it will stop. I don't have to say the "Hey, goog" thing.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.840]   You know, as an example, "Hey, go ahead, garlic to my shopping list." I don't have to say that.
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:14.720]   Just have to say, "Stop!" Which is what apparently a lot of people are doing right now. Anyway,
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:19.200]   this is called guacamole. It'll let you snooze without saying "Hey,
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:25.520]   so..." I don't understand.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:25.920]   Excuse your alarm?
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:34.240]   Skip saying for help with quick tasks, but they don't say...
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:37.440]   How does that always listen? So then it just does always stink.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.120]   Oh, no!
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:43.840]   Well, no. I mean, this is a relevant question to ask.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:44.800]   That's it.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:48.640]   So a ringing alarm can be canceled just by saying "stop" or "snooze."
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:50.880]   Does it know because it's ringing the alarm?
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:53.920]   The alarm is ringing and it says, "Okay, let's listen for snappy schooze."
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.280]   Oh, okay. That makes sense.
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:01.120]   Okay. When the phone is ringing, you can say "answer or decline," because it knows this.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.320]   Oh, okay. Again, context.
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:03.520]   Context, yeah.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:04.240]   That makes sense.
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:05.280]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:06.880]   So I think it's connected very well.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:07.680]   It didn't "guacamole" is just...
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.640]   Guacamole is the name of the update.
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.840]   No, it's the name of a very delicious avocado-based dip.
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:17.120]   Well, that's what I'm like.
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:20.240]   I'm like, "If you said, let's talk about guacamole and I'm like, "Yes, let's."
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:21.920]   And then you're like, "If you say..."
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:22.720]   You were excited.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:23.680]   We've been...
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:25.840]   How much garlic do you need in "nequacamole?"
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:27.280]   Should we order some more?
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:32.240]   The feature is code named guacamole.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.240]   Don't bother me.
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:34.320]   Why?
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:34.800]   That's what they...
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:34.960]   Why?
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:35.520]   Who knows?
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:35.680]   Why?
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:36.640]   Who knows?
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:38.640]   Because it's fun to say "holy guacamole."
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:40.480]   That's why.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.400]   Wait, is it working for you, Ant?
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:44.960]   Or did you just get an earthquake alert?
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:45.360]   Oh, no.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:48.560]   I just got an update for another part of the change log.
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.160]   Oh, coming here, here.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.280]   Which one is that one?
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.280]   Ants moving us along.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:58.000]   The "denoising" option in Google Photos.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.560]   "Sharpened and denoise rolling out to Google Photos."
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:05.760]   "Mr. Photographer, what does sharpened and denoise do?"
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:10.160]   Well, see, if you look at a photo that you take in low light,
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:13.840]   you tend to get a lot of grain and noise and artifacts
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:16.560]   right there in the background if you can see it on this camera.
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:22.960]   But the hard part about this is a lot of times Google's HDR AI
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:26.880]   will try to fix that before you even see this part of it.
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:30.240]   So I was wondering, I don't know how useful that's going to be,
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:33.920]   but I finally found a shot that actually had this noise in the background.
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:37.600]   So it's a dim shot with bottle of whiskey and a glass.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.120]   And so you get all that grain.
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:40.400]   Oh, it kind of does, yeah.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:42.000]   It does pretty well.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.560]   I tell you, Ant, that I feel so sad when I take a photo in Google's like,
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.680]   "This is a photo, but can I recommend a shot for you instead?"
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.440]   That is an insult.
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:58.960]   And then you're like, "Dang, Google, so cruel."
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:02.240]   So I just wanted to complain about that.
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:06.720]   I think they missed a bet they should have called this "bring out to sharpen and bring out denoise."
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:07.280]   But okay.
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:10.400]   [laughter]
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:11.280]   Sharpen is what?
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:12.160]   What is sharpen?
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:19.600]   Sharpen is in laymars turn is the best way to try to give your subject a little bit more edge
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.920]   to stand out from its surroundings.
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:24.160]   But you don't want to over sharpen.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:25.600]   I always over sharpen.
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.080]   I know.
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:28.160]   Because it looks really bad.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:28.560]   It looks really bad.
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:29.760]   Have halos around them.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:33.920]   I like this feature for Google Assistant.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:37.360]   If you flub your voice command, how many times do you do that?
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:41.440]   You start a command and just send me greats on its way.
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:44.080]   It's like, "Oh, just forget."
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.120]   Look at my shopping list.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:46.320]   No, I mean shallots.
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:46.880]   Shallots.
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:58.160]   So I guess if Google is working on knowing that when you kind of correct it,
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.120]   that, "Oh, in fact, I think this happened the other day,"
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.520]   I said something.
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.640]   I said a timer for five minutes.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:07.040]   I mean, 10 minutes and it said a timer for 10 minutes.
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.480]   So it's starting to learn.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.840]   Oh, nice.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.160]   It's in your head.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.480]   They call it the BERT system.
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:19.440]   Biodirectional encoder representations from transformers.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.360]   It's basically natural language processing.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:29.440]   It looks at the every word in the sentence as a whole and tries to make those corrections
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:30.320]   on the fly.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.280]   That's interesting.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:33.440]   And I think it did happen to me the other day.
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:33.760]   Does it say-
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:34.880]   You want to try it right now?
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:35.040]   No.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.160]   Okay.
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:39.760]   That would slow us down and we're moving on.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:45.840]   YouTube ads, even more video resolution controls and options on mobile.
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:50.800]   So now you can change the resolution.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:53.360]   Just play with the options if you're on mobile.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.640]   I didn't like that.
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.600]   The change in resolution, it used to be so much simpler.
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:01.200]   You just hit the hamburger button and it gave you your list of resolution.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:01.840]   480.
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.920]   And now it's like scrolling through and okay, no, you want the maximum.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:09.200]   But well, then again, this maximum isn't quite the maximum.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:10.720]   So you hit one more screen.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.480]   I didn't care for that.
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:13.600]   It's well.
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:18.560]   It's the choice between the simple choices and granular, more granular.
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:20.480]   And I guess they're opting for more granular.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:27.360]   You can change your YouTube channel name, but not your Google account name.
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.520]   So if you didn't like your YouTube channel name, which by the way happens all the time.
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:37.120]   Or your profile picture, you can change it.
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:40.160]   And there were instructions here at cnet.com.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:44.160]   It's in the edit channel section.
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:52.480]   So, but you can't, sorry, Jeff, you can't change your name in your work account.
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:50:01.840]   It took Google 526 days to give you a way to search through your 172 games on Stadia.
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:06.480]   But you know, they're a search company.
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:10.320]   They should have figured out that people might want to search through your games.
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:17.040]   The at they're adding a new revolutionary search bar to Stadia.
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:20.800]   And that's the Google change.
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:21.440]   Long.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:25.360]   Congratulations.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:29.680]   It looks like Kevin Tofel is going to be a GT yellow jacket.
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:30.880]   This is so cool.
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:32.320]   Georgia Tech.
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.720]   Oh, yes.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:35.680]   He did post it.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:35.920]   Okay.
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:36.480]   I didn't know.
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.360]   I was so excited.
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:38.160]   I'm so excited.
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:38.800]   And a hell of a.
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:40.160]   I was so excited.
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.720]   He's a rambling wreck from Georgia Tech.
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:45.520]   Yes.
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:45.840]   That's the.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:45.840]   That's the.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:50.480]   He's a little sad because he wanted to be a sun devil, not a yellow jacket, but.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:50.880]   Right.
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:53.280]   He was really excited about this program.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.480]   It's all online.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:56.560]   It is a legit program for him.
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:58.560]   It's a master's in computer science.
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:50:59.520]   It is a master's.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.480]   He's been teaching.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.200]   Well, he's been.
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:08.080]   Taking college, like community college programming classes, and he loves teaching people how to program,
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:10.080]   but he can't get any jobs and teaching.
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.120]   But I'm a master's.
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:11.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:15.440]   Oh, and I, you know, I.
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:18.960]   I have one working with Kevin, obviously, but he's going to be so great.
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:23.520]   You see, and I have only a bachelor's and I have started three master's degrees.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:25.520]   Oh, wow.
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:26.880]   Well, we won't tell Kevin that.
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.080]   No.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:32.000]   You think that his kind of experience would get him teaching.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:32.320]   You gave.
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:33.680]   And you feel very.
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:37.840]   They're very focused on having that degree before he can.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:38.480]   Where's he trying?
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:41.680]   Is he trying to teach at community college level or something like that or.
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:44.000]   I think he's.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.680]   So Kevin, I mean, like every, every week he sends me something new.
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:49.200]   He's coded up right just for fun.
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:54.800]   Like the other day he made me he was like, hey, look, I just made it my own version of Trello.
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:57.360]   And I'm like, wow, that's impressive.
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:57.840]   Okay.
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:58.800]   In Python.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.160]   In Python?
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:00.560]   Wow.
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:01.760]   She's in Python.
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:02.640]   I mean, he does.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:04.800]   He is some it's in Python.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:07.200]   Sometimes he does he sends like little quizzes.
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:08.160]   He's done and see.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:09.680]   I mean, it's just whatever.
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:11.920]   He's very proud and nobody cares.
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:13.200]   So we're going to play this song.
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:16.000]   For Kevin Tofold.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.840]   I'm the hell of an engineer.
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:20.160]   Go ahead.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:20.560]   Sing it.
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:21.920]   I love that.
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:23.120]   It's all good.
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:23.120]   It's all good.
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:25.280]   Fellows that drank my whiskey clear.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:26.960]   I'm a Ramlin rek from Georgia Tech.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:28.800]   How the hell have an engineer?
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:29.120]   Hey.
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:36.240]   Oh, if I had a daughter, sir, I'd dress her in white and gold and put her on the campus to cheer the brave and bold.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.840]   But if I had some sir, I'd tell you what he'd do.
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:42.960]   He would yell to hell with Georgia like his daddy used to do.
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:47.520]   This is a very interesting song.
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:49.200]   Hey, Marching Band.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:51.120]   I wish everybody had their own marching band.
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:53.360]   This is just for Kevin Tofold.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:54.480]   Like individuals?
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:59.360]   He is a Ramlin rek from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer.
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:00.960]   I always thought I saw it.
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:03.040]   That's I'm not a Georgia Tech fan, but I love that.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.840]   How long does the degree program take?
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:06.880]   How long is it going to be doing that?
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:09.680]   You can do it at your own pace.
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:10.320]   Oh, so.
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:13.680]   It's designed for people who have real jobs.
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:14.240]   Right.
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:14.800]   So.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:15.760]   Professor Tofold.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.040]   Really excited for him, y'all.
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:19.520]   Yay.
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:27.120]   So let's take one more break and then I will do some more news.
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:27.760]   How about that?
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:32.800]   Speaking of Ramlin rek's, I want to talk about the Enterprise Tech 30.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:37.200]   This is a list developed by Wing Venture Capital in partnership with NASDAQ.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:43.840]   The Enterprise Tech 30 is a list every enterprise startup wants to be on.
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:46.000]   It's great for you.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.200]   I mean, if you're a founder of an enterprise tech company,
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:54.560]   it's the highest endorsement of your success, both current and future.
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:57.040]   And if you're trying to build a publicly traded company, man,
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:00.480]   this is a watershed moment in your journey.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:03.520]   But for the rest of us, it's also a great buying guide.
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:07.040]   If you're an enterprise executive and you're trying to bring more validated
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:12.000]   and credible digital innovation into your organization, look at the ET 30.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.200]   This is the way to go.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:17.280]   Now, there are a lot of lists, but I have to tell you, the thing about the ET 30,
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:20.800]   that's great is you can't lobby your way onto it.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:28.800]   You can only be selected and the selection committee is very good, very good.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:34.240]   So it's a really valuable list to get on awardees to the ET 30 or on a fast track of growth
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:36.400]   and to change how business is done.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:40.400]   They're on their way to future IPOs, multi-billion dollar exits.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:45.200]   The enterprise tech 30 focuses on companies with potential at all stages of maturity,
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:50.000]   not those just mature already with traction.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.600]   There are a lot of startups in there.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:52.720]   This is a hard thing to do.
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:55.200]   Enterprise tech, especially if it's not public,
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:58.320]   you know, they're not publicly held companies, it's fairly opaque.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:04.400]   It's hard to tell if a company's doing well or badly and people are cagey about their
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:08.720]   growth and revenue sales cycles can be very long and arduous.
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:11.760]   There are a lot of different stages you can be on and some of them,
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.520]   you know, you just don't have a lot of growth.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:16.000]   There are a lot of lists.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.760]   They're often dominated by consumer brands, well-known brands or mature startups.
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:23.360]   Everybody already knows about not the ET 30.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:28.000]   This is the way to discover new enterprise tech.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:35.200]   There's no bias. These lists are created by people who really know what they're doing.
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:40.080]   You can consider it an honor to be on it, a buying guide for executives,
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:44.480]   high performance operators who use the list to guide the decisions on what companies to
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:45.920]   go to work for as well.
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:46.720]   Kevin Tofel.
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:48.480]   Kevin Tofel.
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:50.880]   Really, really good.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:55.200]   Look at, if you go to the website, enterprisetech30.com, we're on it right now
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:00.800]   on the video enterprisetech30.com.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:02.080]   Read about the methodology.
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:02.960]   I think it's important.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:10.000]   It's at the top of the list because that is going to give you an idea of how valuable
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.440]   this is.
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:12.480]   There's no lobbying.
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:14.000]   There's no pay to play.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.040]   This is really deep research, a very, very valuable list.
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:20.080]   You can get it right now.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:24.560]   All you have to do is go to enterprisetech30.
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:29.280]   Enterprisetech30.com to see who's on this year's list just came out.
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:38.800]   Thanks to Wing Venture Capital and NASDAQ and the ET30 for their support, enterprisetech30.com.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:41.200]   The ET30 is out.
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:46.480]   What did you, I saw you, I saw you pop that in your mouth.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:48.800]   Stacey, Stacey, you're good about them.
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:50.480]   I saw you pop that in your mouth.
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:50.960]   Is it one?
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:51.840]   Did you pull time?
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:53.600]   Did you bring enough to share for everybody?
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:55.280]   Oh, that dog roos fooled me.
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:57.680]   I have a package.
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:56:59.120]   I have to go get a package.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:56:59.840]   I did bring enough to share.
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:02.000]   The package is called Jesus.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.240]   You're Jesus in the mail.
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:05.840]   You're Jesus, they're in the mail.
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:07.760]   You see how pedestrian of you.
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:08.640]   Cheezits are great.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.000]   Do not knock.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:10.720]   Chances are delicious.
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:10.960]   I agree.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:11.760]   It's a bite.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:14.000]   Wheat thins or triscuits.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:14.960]   Wheat thins for the wind.
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:15.680]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:16.400]   Yes, all three.
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:17.120]   Yes.
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:18.800]   Thin pepper crackers.
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:19.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:20.640]   I can't do a show with that.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:22.080]   You got more like what I expected.
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:23.040]   She needs assistance.
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:24.640]   That's what I expected was Stacy.
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:27.760]   Guacamole and then Ants taking a little
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:28.800]   swig at something there.
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:29.840]   Sorry.
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:31.040]   Goodness gracious.
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:32.480]   You weren't supposed to see that.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:34.080]   Is that like a snifter glass?
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.120]   I see it all.
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:35.840]   I see it all.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.280]   This is a Glen Caron.
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:38.560]   Oh, nice.
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:39.680]   Glen Caron whiskey.
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:40.160]   Nice.
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:41.440]   I'm running out of whiskey.
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:44.800]   So I'm trying to sort of go through it
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.720]   because then once the bottle gets below half,
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:49.040]   this starts to taste bad.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.800]   So I'm trying to go through it.
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:51.760]   What?
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:53.520]   Do you mean once it gets old?
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.560]   Once this is about half into--
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:58.560]   Does your whiskey have time to get old?
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:57:59.040]   Taste that.
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.760]   Well, this is a two-year supply.
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:03.840]   I'm finally down to like my last two.
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:06.640]   Because this is my--
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:07.600]   You got to come to my house.
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.360]   Well, this is my--
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:13.120]   and this is my special one, my Glendronic 18.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:13.600]   Wow.
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:14.160]   Look at you.
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:16.560]   All you drink that for really special occasions,
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:20.400]   but it's about two years old and it's under half.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.920]   So I got to get rid of it.
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:24.400]   I know some ways you could get rid of that.
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:29.760]   I know how you could--
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.520]   Aunt Pruitt's on TikTok.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:33.600]   Is this new?
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:34.880]   Somewhat.
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:36.400]   I'm on there.
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.920]   I only did it because of her.
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:40.560]   But I thought of Mr. Jarvis--
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:42.880]   I think I need to get--
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.560]   See, we corrupted you.
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:45.360]   No.
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:47.120]   Who's laughing?
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:50.880]   That's a track, a life track on there.
[01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:52.000]   It's one of their sound effects.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.840]   But I thought about you when I put that together,
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:57.280]   because she's always on TikTok.
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:57.600]   Yep.
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:58.400]   There you go.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:59.200]   Queen Pruitt.
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:01.840]   Old timers on TikTok.
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:05.040]   And I laugh at it because she grabs her glasses,
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:07.200]   because she can't see the phone.
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:09.760]   No, I do the same thing.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:12.400]   I do not use my glasses to look at TikTok.
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:13.600]   I like to get up close and personal.
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:14.640]   She didn't know I did that ever.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:15.120]   Oh.
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:16.320]   I should have told her later.
[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:17.120]   Oh.
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:17.600]   No.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:18.560]   She was going to say--
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:21.200]   I was going to say, oh, did you enjoy being married?
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:23.600]   She was OK with it, because she knows it's true,
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:27.360]   because she can't have see the phone screens.
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:29.760]   But that's just old folks on TikTok.
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:31.920]   That's how we look, apparently.
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:33.600]   I have other things out there,
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:35.680]   but I just wanted to share that for Mr. Jarvis.
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:36.960]   Be careful, though.
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:40.640]   Do not do the single ladies move on TikTok.
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.160]   Oh, that was a good story.
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:45.360]   Jekyll Knight is a choreographer behind Bayon says,
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.600]   Queen B's single ladies, all the single ladies.
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:54.480]   He has copyrighted the dance moves from the single ladies video.
[01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:56.080]   Apparently--
[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:57.920]   It's the copyright dance moves.
[01:59:57.920 --> 01:59:58.480]   Apparently.
[01:59:58.480 --> 01:59:59.040]   Apparently.
[01:59:59.040 --> 01:59:59.600]   Yes.
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:01.360]   Do you want to see it?
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:03.920]   This is Jeff and I typing copyright dance moves.
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:05.360]   Exactly.
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:06.240]   Choreography.
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:09.760]   It was a successful bid.
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:14.160]   Oh, it wasn't added in to the copyright law until the 1976 law.
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:16.240]   It was a form of dramatic composition.
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:18.400]   So the move is with your hand to show your ring,
[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:19.200]   put a ring on it.
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.000]   Is that the thing?
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.920]   Or is it this whole thing?
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:24.240]   That's a good question.
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:26.800]   I thought about this.
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:31.200]   Let me think about Michael Jackson.
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:33.920]   And it made me think about James Brown.
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:36.160]   When you think about Michael Jackson
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:37.520]   from the internet standpoint--
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:38.960]   Iconic dance moves, right?
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:41.440]   He was an amazing dancer and entertainer,
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.760]   but he was known for that moonwalk.
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:44.480]   Right?
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:44.960]   Right.
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:45.280]   Well--
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:45.600]   Right.
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:46.320]   James Brown.
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:46.800]   By the way, you see that--
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:47.760]   The moonwalk too.
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:48.320]   That's right.
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:50.240]   Oh, well, so hold on.
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:50.800]   Hold on.
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:52.880]   If I'm looking at the criteria,
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:56.720]   protection is more likely if it's by a skilled dancer,
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:58.320]   if it's for the entertainment of others,
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:01.200]   and finally, if it involves a story or a theme.
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:02.000]   So that means--
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:02.560]   I can't--
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:03.360]   I can't copyright.
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:04.160]   You have to have--
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:04.960]   The Leo.
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:05.440]   A related--
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:07.360]   Okay, so hold on.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:07.920]   Is it a landing?
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:08.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:09.760]   Does that list say--
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:12.640]   Does that list have all three of those components,
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:14.080]   or just one of the components?
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:14.720]   Because people are not--
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:15.200]   Well, it's--
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:15.600]   Talk.
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:17.200]   Could you be a talented dancer?
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:19.120]   Well, remember--
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:20.800]   It's all of those things.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:21.280]   Remember--
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:21.760]   Okay.
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:22.240]   Right.
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:23.280]   The attempt--
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:24.160]   And social.
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:25.920]   By Carlton--
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:29.840]   From the Fresh Prince of Beverly Hills to--
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:31.280]   Alfonso Ribeiro.
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:34.640]   Alfonso Ribeiro tried to sue Fortnite Epic Games
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:38.480]   because there is a Carlton-like move.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:39.040]   And the judge--
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:40.320]   But in that case, the judge said,
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:41.760]   "Oh, no, no, you don't own that one."
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:44.080]   That I've seen that all the time or something.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:46.000]   I mean, it wasn't copyrightable
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.480]   because he didn't really invent it.
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:49.440]   Right.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:53.520]   Yeah, whatever it is you're trying to do,
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:54.720]   we do it first.
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:58.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:01:58.960]   The key.
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:01:58.960]   The--
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:01:58.960]   The key.
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:00.160]   Yeah, the answer.
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:00.960]   It does.
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:04.320]   Oh, you can't copyright end zone celebratory dances.
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:04.960]   Oh.
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:06.160]   Were yoga positions--
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:06.560]   What?
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:08.000]   Or social dances.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:08.560]   Why not?
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:10.640]   Seems unfair.
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:12.240]   Oh, I--
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:15.440]   Really, yoga positions have been around for millennia.
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:15.840]   Right.
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:16.880]   Well, yeah.
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:17.440]   OK.
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:17.600]   OK.
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:18.560]   Thousands.
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:23.520]   So Sundar Pachai says, "significant announcements
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:30.560]   at Google I/O as product cycles return to normal."
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:31.440]   We know Google I/O--
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.240]   Chromebook.
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:32.800]   Chromebook.
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:35.200]   --will be May 18th through 20th.
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:36.800]   We will stream, livestream.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:38.320]   And I hope-- maybe Jeff, you should join me
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:38.960]   so we can hear you--
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:39.440]   The other phone.
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.560]   --sweed when there's a new Chromebook.
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:41.760]   We will stream the May 18th.
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:42.320]   Squeed.
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:42.720]   Squeed.
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:43.920]   Squeed.
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:46.160]   It's keynote.
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:47.680]   It's on my calendar already.
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:48.240]   Put it in.
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:49.920]   What day of the week is that?
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:50.880]   It's a Tuesday.
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:51.440]   OK.
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:52.080]   1 p.m.
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:53.760]   ET, so 10 a.m.
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:54.320]   Your time.
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:55.360]   Perfect.
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:57.360]   We'll do it right before Mac break weekly.
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:00.000]   And I hope that he sticks to an hour.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000]   But if not, we'll push the show a bit.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.360]   Let's see what it is saying here.
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:04.320]   It's--
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:06.400]   No, it's two hours.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:06.960]   Two hours?
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:07.760]   Well, we'll be pushing--
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:08.480]   One to three.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:10.480]   --developer keynote is 315 to 4.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:14.640]   And what's new in Android is 435 ET,
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:16.400]   because I'm at the center of the universal--
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:17.360]   figure it out, people.
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:18.000]   Yeah.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.920]   Well, that's good, because all about Android
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:20.440]   is that night.
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.120]   So they'll be covering that.
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:22.480]   Yep.
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.040]   Great.
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:25.920]   So the tease is that product releases
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:28.320]   are returning to a regular cadence.
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:31.360]   I had thought there was a little sleepy last year at Google.
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:33.840]   Well, we talked about that, how they kind of pulled back
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:34.480]   on the phone.
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:35.200]   Yeah.
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:36.960]   There was nothing in it.
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:40.160]   So let's see.
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:43.040]   Pichai said YouTube shorts have 6 and 1/2 billion daily
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:44.000]   views as of March.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.760]   That's the new compete with TikTok thing.
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:47.760]   Right.
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:51.960]   This is all from their Google E quarter results.
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:55.320]   So yeah, the new schedule is out for Google I/O.
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:04:00.400]   The keynote 10 AM Pacific May 18.
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:03.520]   So we're adding to that to our calendar as well, Jeff.
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:03.960]   That'll be fine.
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:06.320]   Were you surprised that Samsung didn't mention
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:07.600]   any Chromebooks this morning?
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:08.800]   I thought they would.
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:09.560]   I really did.
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:10.440]   Hurt terribly.
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:11.040]   Yeah.
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:13.080]   I actually watched it.
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:13.560]   Hoping.
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:15.360]   I don't understand why they can't make that nice machine.
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:16.880]   And then just say, and you can get it in Chrome.
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:19.120]   I guess because you could also get it a lot cheaper than Microsoft.
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:20.600]   So maybe they don't want to do that.
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:23.680]   So basically they announced the Galaxy Book Pro
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:25.760]   and Pro 360 laptops.
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:27.480]   And they said, and this was very--
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:29.160]   they are more like smartphones.
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:31.120]   I want to laptop this more like a smartphone.
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:32.120]   Why?
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:33.320]   Because people use it every day.
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:34.680]   I think it was kind of interesting.
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:35.600]   They use it every day.
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:37.280]   They love it.
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:38.840]   Touch screen, stylus.
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:40.520]   Touch screen.
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:40.920]   I don't--
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:43.800]   I-- OK.
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:44.440]   It feels to me like--
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:46.120]   I'm not going to need to touch screen laptops,
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:51.520]   but I do like stylus interoperability with the laptop.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:54.800]   Because I like using Photoshop and doing retouches
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:56.520]   with a stylus.
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:58.640]   I like that.
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:01.680]   It feels like, well, we have this really successful product
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:03.680]   category, these Samsung phones.
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:05.600]   We should make everything more like that.
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:06.920]   And that seems like a mistake.
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:10.840]   Well, they also say they also did a shtick about how your--
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:13.000]   A, it's more interoperable with the phone,
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.200]   which has been there for a while.
[02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:18.600]   And B, that your laptop should be your ideal hub for your IoT.
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:19.120]   Right.
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:19.600]   Like, I'm saying--
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:22.360]   Well, with that argument, is an Apple pretty much
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:24.680]   doing the same thing with iOS and how you're
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:28.000]   trying to continue to link everything together between--
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:28.000]   Yeah.
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:28.840]   --kinda with some--
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:29.340]   Yeah.
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:30.160]   --it was quite a way.
[02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:31.200]   I was like, I think that's terrible.
[02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:32.520]   Don't do that.
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:33.520]   Yeah.
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:35.960]   Well, I don't want more iOS-y features on Mac OS.
[02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:37.360]   That isn't what I like.
[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:38.080]   And I agree.
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:39.800]   Yeah.
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:41.560]   All right.
[02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:44.040]   15-inch Galaxy Book, 11th Generation,
[02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:46.480]   Intel.
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:49.360]   It was all Intel that no AMD.
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:49.920]   Nope.
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:53.240]   Thunderbolt 4, the Obranit Evo.
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:58.640]   That-- it bored me watching it.
[02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:01.120]   And I eventually turned it off because I had to come in
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.480]   for last weekly.
[02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:04.400]   It bores me talking about it.
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:06.600]   No even-- no Chromebooks, really?
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:07.080]   Yeah.
[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:08.080]   That's satisfying.
[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:09.080]   Yeah.
[02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:09.600]   Well--
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:10.200]   --and to my heart.
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:11.280]   Significant announcements.
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:14.320]   You know, Google has not released a new Chromebook
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:16.240]   in Pixelbook in two years?
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:16.960]   Three years.
[02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:18.360]   Those is 2017.
[02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:19.200]   Oh, I actually know that's right.
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:19.640]   You're right.
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:20.200]   Because they have the--
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:21.200]   --the Pixelbook.
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.320]   They have the slave in them once we call it.
[02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:24.360]   Yeah.
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:25.600]   So they're due.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:27.920]   And I don't think they want to get out of this business.
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:30.640]   That's actually an important business for them, I think.
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:32.120]   Yes.
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:36.760]   So SpaceX petitioned the FCC, let them
[02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:40.520]   fly their satellites for the Starlink project,
[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:43.880]   the Global Internet Project, lower.
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:51.400]   The operational altitude was originally 1,100 to 1,200 kilometers.
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:53.200]   It's going to go down to-- wow.
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:55.280]   540 to 570 kilometers.
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:58.440]   That's 336 to 354 miles high.
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:00.880]   These are very low-earth orbit.
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:04.360]   That reduces latency, increases speed.
[02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:05.560]   Amazon objected.
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:08.400]   They were worried about it.
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:12.640]   But after the FCC issued its order, Amazon said its concerns
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:16.640]   were adequately addressed by the conditions the commission
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:19.520]   placed on approval.
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:23.160]   I think this is fantastic.
[02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:25.880]   I don't have anything-- any thoughts about that low-earth orbit?
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:27.320]   There may be issues I don't know about,
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:30.120]   like astronomers, pictures of the sky, things like that.
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:31.200]   Astronomers are not keen.
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:32.360]   They're not happy.
[02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:35.960]   But I think global high-speed internet
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:39.480]   and every square inch of the earth is a good thing.
[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:41.640]   Yeah, it's truly global high-speed internet
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:44.640]   that's reliable, yes.
[02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:49.400]   It's a big if we have yet to have that for satellites.
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:51.480]   I think it's going to be a transformation.
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:53.760]   Sorry, at a decent cost with decent devices.
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:55.040]   Well, it's expensive now.
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:56.040]   It's 500 bucks.
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:57.400]   If you want to get in the Starlink beta,
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:01.600]   it's 500 bucks for the equipment and 99 bucks a month
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:02.600]   for the internet.
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:04.120]   Yeah, but remember satellite--
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:06.840]   I mean, satellite broadband service
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:09.680]   was terrible and expensive and slow.
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:11.960]   And then when you think about satellite phone service,
[02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:15.040]   it was expensive and slow.
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:17.920]   So in this-- I mean, 99-- yeah, that's money,
[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:19.640]   but it's not that much money for satellite.
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:25.960]   Publix Bullies, Chicken Tender Sandwich Twitter account.
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:26.800]   Yeah.
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:29.440]   Into silence.
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:32.040]   So this account existed to do one thing,
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:35.760]   to tell you when the Chicken Tender Sandwich
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:37.240]   was on sale at Publix.
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:37.880]   It's all it did.
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:39.840]   Publix is a supermarket.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.320]   Publix in the south.
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:44.120]   The sandwich has the Chicken Tenders of the Mayo,
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:47.240]   or the one sandwich would be 2,000 calories.
[02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:49.200]   Oh, what?
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:50.080]   That's--
[02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:53.400]   That's more than my entire budget for the day.
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:54.840]   Yeah.
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:57.000]   2,000 calories.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.320]   Bless your heart.
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:00.640]   Have some sweet tea with that and just kill yourself right
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:01.200]   out right.
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:02.040]   Just go for it.
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:03.360]   Just diet, man.
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:06.880]   When I hear people talk about 2,000 calories and stuff like that,
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:08.280]   I'm like, that's breakfast.
[02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:10.560]   Yeah, but you lift, man.
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:12.040]   You lift.
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:15.640]   I get about 1,600 calories a day total.
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:16.640]   Dad, you lift.
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:18.480]   If I lift it, yeah.
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:22.000]   How many eggs do you have for breakfast?
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.800]   If I really want to do like I should do,
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:27.240]   I would have six at a time.
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:29.200]   My doctors said I could only have eight a week,
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:31.880]   and I was really sad about that because I don't eat a lot of meat.
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:32.520]   So I need to--
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:34.120]   I would do six at a time.
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:37.600]   But nowadays, I only do three or four for breakfast.
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:39.320]   We go through a lot of eggs in our house.
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:40.880]   I highly encourage my house.
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:42.200]   That's why you move to Petaluma.
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:43.680]   We're egg country.
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:45.400]   I love it.
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:46.040]   I love it.
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:47.040]   Mr. Ex-Everer.
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:49.720]   Petal put me onto Skippies right down the street
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:50.560]   from the studio.
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:51.000]   Nice.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.080]   Oh, love it.
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:53.800]   Thank you, Mr. Hot.
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:54.520]   What Skippies?
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:56.160]   You never told me about Skippies.
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:57.320]   It's the egg store.
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:00.000]   They have eggs in a lot of the stuff there.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:00.440]   Yeah.
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:01.080]   In Petaluma.
[02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:02.280]   Is that next to your sushi gas station?
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:05.600]   Is right down the street from the studio?
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:10.280]   And they go in there and they got just a mound of eggs, organic,
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:13.000]   or what have you, and so much cheaper than going
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:13.800]   to the grocery store.
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:15.960]   I've lived here my last 30 years.
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:18.200]   I've never heard about Skippies Egg Store.
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:19.280]   Mm-hmm.
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:22.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:25.200]   I go to every week now.
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:28.080]   Skippies Egg Store.
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:29.360]   Is this it?
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:31.080]   Yeah, that's it.
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:31.800]   That's it.
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:32.800]   I'll get like 10--
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:33.240]   I'll get like 20--
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:34.240]   It's like a store where you need a gentle go.
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:36.960]   --gillow-scor organic eggs for like $6.
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:39.640]   You get $20 for like $6.
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:42.000]   Is that Skippy right there on the cash register?
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:42.800]   Is that Skippy or--
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:43.920]   Dad, I'm not sure, sir.
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:45.640]   That's gotta be Skippy in the picture there.
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:46.140]   Sure.
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:46.640]   Oh, yes.
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:47.640]   I don't know their names.
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:48.240]   Skippy is just ma'am.
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:49.240]   Our founder.
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:53.920]   Our founder, Sorting Eggs, right there in the framed photo.
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:55.640]   Doesn't look that big.
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:57.480]   Oh, it's an egg farm.
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:10:58.000]   It's an egg farm.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.080]   Yeah, it's a local farm.
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:04.160]   So you're supporting them directly.
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:06.680]   I like to live across the street from this.
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:07.240]   Yeah, it's a great thing.
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:08.640]   I don't know about Skippy.
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:10.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:10.720]   I'm serious.
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:14.120]   It's like five minutes, if that much, from the studio.
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:18.360]   So every Wednesday or every Friday, when I'm at the studio,
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:19.920]   when I leave, that's where I go.
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:21.240]   I know it's in Northern California
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:24.040]   because it's right next door to Funny Farms hydroponics.
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:27.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:31.440]   So it's definitely Northern California.
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:31.960]   OK.
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:33.240]   That's your first stop.
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:34.400]   Skippy's Egg Store.
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:35.400]   Let's see what the eggs.
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:38.040]   What are those big gallon--
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:42.960]   Well, they have cheese and they have ham sandwich meat ham
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:44.000]   and whatnot.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.360]   But cheese and milk.
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:48.800]   I usually get milk there and get cream there because I like
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:53.040]   heavy-dag gum cream and coffee, not that half and half stuff.
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:53.760]   Give me all that.
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:56.320]   It's a good day for Skippy's wet ant comes fall.
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:58.800]   Have you ever heard the--
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:02.520]   we talked about this on Sunday with Phillip Elmer DeWitt,
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:03.760]   who worked at Time Magazine.
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:05.120]   He was never in Time Magazine.
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:06.440]   Isn't he great?
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:07.800]   And he said that at time they had--
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:08.600]   He was talking about him.
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:09.960]   Yeah, you know, Phillip.
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:11.840]   Yeah, you were at Fortune, right?
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:13.560]   Yeah, he was at Fortune.
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:17.600]   He used to have a phrase called "Barry the Pickle."
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:18.640]   It's a journalism phrase.
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:19.440]   Yeah, I saw that.
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:21.720]   You guys, have you ever heard of that "Barry the Pickle"?
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:22.240]   No.
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:24.080]   It's not like "Barry the Lead."
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:26.080]   It's writing a headline of a story that's
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:27.120]   'cause so misleading.
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:30.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:33.600]   That the actual fact of the story is not apparent
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:36.800]   until deep within the story.
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:40.560]   This is the Pickleberry story that you were talking about.
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:43.240]   You say in the show, no, explain this to me, Leo,
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:44.720]   from The Washington Post.
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:47.280]   Minutes before Trump left office,
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:50.360]   millions of the Pentagon's dormant IP addresses
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:51.960]   sprang to life.
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:55.280]   After decades of not using a huge chunk of the internet,
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:59.080]   the Pentagon has given control of millions of computer
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:02.760]   addresses to a previously unknown company.
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:05.560]   In an effort toy-- well, then now we get to a little bit
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:08.120]   close to the truth in an effort to identify possible cyber
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:09.480]   vulnerabilities and threats.
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:10.760]   And then if you dig a little deeper,
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:14.320]   this previously unknown company is called The Pentagon.
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:15.840]   And in fact--
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:17.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:18.120]   The whole thing--
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:19.960]   This story was all-- yeah.
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:20.360]   This was terrible.
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:21.560]   I could not figure it out.
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:24.880]   They said a reporter-- this is the funniest part.
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:30.360]   They said a reporter to the business address
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:32.400]   for this unknown company.
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:34.200]   Let me read this.
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:35.600]   That part was funny.
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:37.800]   Yeah, it's bizarre.
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:40.400]   As listed in the records, the company's address
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:43.400]   in Plantation, Florida, outside Fort Lauderdale.
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:46.440]   It's called Global Resource Systems.
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.880]   It's a company founded in September
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:51.080]   that has no publicly reported federal contracts,
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:54.960]   no obvious public facing website.
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:57.680]   The reporter-- this is where it began.
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:13:59.320]   This is the pickle, by the way.
[02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:00.440]   This is where it began.
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:02.400]   The reporter found this, heard this.
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:04.480]   She said-- she looked it up.
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:09.160]   The office-- the company addresses a shared workspace
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:12.880]   in an office building that doesn't show global resources
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:14.040]   systems on its lobby directory.
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:15.680]   That means she went there, right?
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.120]   She went and looked-- global research.
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:17.800]   I don't see it here.
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:18.000]   I don't see it here.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.560]   You were going to see that in a minute.
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:22.960]   A receptionist at the shared workspace said Friday,
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:26.200]   she could provide no information about the company
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:30.680]   and ask the reporter to leave.
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:31.520]   I said, good day sir.
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:33.560]   I must be on the safety of the big beer.
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:36.560]   They told me to leave.
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:38.560]   I'm on the trail.
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:43.560]   So eventually this goes on and on and on and on and on.
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:44.560]   Finally--
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:45.560]   It's a shaggy cable story.
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:47.560]   It's a shaggy cable story.
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:50.560]   Finally, a spokesperson for the Defense Department
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:52.560]   confirmed in a statement to the Washington Post.
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:55.560]   The Pentagon still owns all the IP address space
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:58.560]   has not sold any of it to a private party.
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:00.560]   Because this address-- never mind,
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:02.560]   this address space, which is 11.
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:04.560]   We talked about it on security now yesterday.
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:06.560]   It's 11.something, something, something.
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:07.560]   They own the whole 11.
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:10.560]   I think 145 million addresses.
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:12.560]   It's a huge number of addresses.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:14.560]   But the Pentagon-- remember, we have to remember,
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:17.560]   the internet began as a Defense Department research project
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:18.560]   in DARPA.
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:20.560]   And so, of course they did.
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:22.560]   They said, well, we'll take those.
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:23.560]   Not that we'll ever use them.
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:25.560]   And the fact there was at one point-- and Steve thinks this is
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:31.560]   the real reason for this-- at one point, Congress wrote a bill
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:35.560]   that was never passed to force the Pentagon to sell these addresses.
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:37.560]   Yeah, with the IPv4--
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:38.560]   They'd be worse--
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:39.560]   Oh, we're out of IPv4.
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:40.560]   Oh, we're out of IPv4.
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:41.560]   We're out of the million bucks.
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:42.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:43.560]   That bill did not pass.
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:45.560]   The Defense Department does not use them.
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:48.560]   But the problem is you could set up botnets-- because they don't use it,
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:52.560]   you could do all sorts of nefarious things pretending to be 11.
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.560]   And so, what they did is they-- it's actually a completely
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:15:59.560]   reasonable security process.
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:02.560]   They routed all the traffic that had been going through that just to see.
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:04.560]   And then they searched for it to see if anything's-- but he's doing
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:05.560]   anything bad with it.
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:06.560]   And shut it down.
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:07.560]   It's the equivalent.
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:10.560]   Yeah, it's the equivalent of having an empty house and checking on it.
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:12.560]   Checking on the empty house.
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:15.560]   Oh, thank you, Stacey, if all of this had that in the lead.
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:17.560]   Good day, sir!
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:19.560]   I said, good day!
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:20.560]   Good day!
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:24.560]   [laughter]
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:28.560]   Now, the other question is, well, minutes before Trump left off
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:36.560]   as part of the headline, and the chatroom came up with some speculation
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:42.560]   that probably this completely normal security procedure,
[02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:47.560]   this checking the house, this inventory, had approval from the prior
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:50.560]   administration, and they didn't want to go through the whole process again
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:52.560]   with a brand new Secretary of Defense and all that.
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:56.560]   So they said, well, look, we better get this done before the inauguration.
[02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:58.560]   So that's why they did that.
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:16:59.560]   And I think that makes sense.
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:00.560]   I don't know why.
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:04.560]   But in other words, as suspicious as this all sounds,
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:07.560]   there is absolutely nothing nefarious going on.
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:08.560]   No!
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:11.560]   It's completely normal.
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:13.560]   Completely normal.
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:14.560]   Good day, sir!
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:18.560]   I said, good day!
[02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:19.560]   I love that.
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:20.560]   I love that ant.
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:21.560]   Good reference.
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:23.560]   [laughter]
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:28.560]   A more serious story, a man named Dan Kaminsky, who is a very well-known
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:34.560]   security researcher, who's done some really, really good work in his life
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:38.560]   passed away at the age of 42, very young age, or 42 last week.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:39.560]   Really sweet guy.
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:42.560]   I did not know him, but Steve did and said he's just...
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:44.560]   Everybody who knows him says he was very, very sweet.
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:46.560]   This obituary was the nice...
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:48.560]   Is it really a formal obituary?
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:49.560]   I don't know.
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:53.560]   As a journalist who has worked for years closely with some sources,
[02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:58.560]   I thought Nicole Perlath, who has covered this area for years,
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:05.560]   did such a good job on a guy that many of my friends know and are crushed by.
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:07.560]   So it was wonderful.
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:13.560]   And can I just say this story as a mom, it made me feel so good.
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:17.560]   Like, here is like a mom who had a real influence on her kid.
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:18.560]   It did a great job.
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:19.560]   That's all.
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:23.560]   Send it to your mom for Mother's Day and be like, you are this woman.
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:25.560]   You are like this level of mom to me.
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:27.560]   And the mom will be like, thanks.
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:29.560]   Perlath, more obituary.
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:30.560]   Right.
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:34.560]   In the New York Times obituary that Kaminsky was a respected practitioner of pen testing,
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:39.560]   the business of compromising the security of computer systems at the behest of owners who
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:41.560]   want to harden their systems from attack.
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:45.560]   It was a profession that his mother, Trudy Marr, said he'd first developed an act for
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:50.560]   as a four year old in San Francisco after his father gave him a computer from Radio Shack.
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:56.560]   By age five, he had taught himself to code.
[02:18:56.560 --> 02:19:01.000]   When Daniel was 11, his mother said he received an angry phone call from someone who identified
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.560]   himself 11, mind you, as a network administrator for the Western United States.
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:12.440]   The administrator said someone at her residence was monkeying around in territories where
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:15.040]   he shouldn't be monkeying around.
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:20.040]   Daniel had been examining military websites without her knowledge.
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:25.040]   The administrator warned to punish him by cutting off the family's internet access.
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:29.040]   Mrs. Moore warned the administrator if he made good on his threat, she would take out an
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:34.040]   advertisement in the San Francisco Chronicle denouncing the Pentagon's security.
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:37.040]   "I will take out an ad that says," she said.
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:41.040]   "Your security is so crappy, even an 11 year old can break it."
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:46.040]   They settled on a compromise punishment.
[02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:51.040]   Really amazing.
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:58.040]   He discovered in 2008 a problem, this is his best known for a problem with the DNS system,
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:01.040]   and got everybody in the country to fix this.
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:03.040]   He called Paul Vixie.
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:08.040]   Vixie once he heard the explanation said, "I realized we were looking down the gun barrel
[02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:09.040]   of history.
[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:12.040]   It meant everything in the digital universe was going to have to get patched."
[02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:16.040]   Of course, Kaminsky was very responsible.
[02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:21.040]   It told Nick Vixie first they fixed it before, and it was ever revealed to anybody.
[02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:26.040]   He kept it a secret until he presented it at Black Hat.
[02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:29.040]   I can go on and on.
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:37.040]   Kaminsky was a lifelong Type 1 diabetic and unfortunately succumbed to ketoacidosis.
[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:42.040]   He apparently had been hospitalized frequently in recent years.
[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:49.040]   He was very sad, but here is a man whose life really made such a big difference.
[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:53.040]   His mom is pretty darn cool.
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:57.040]   He's somebody everybody I think in our community has heard of.
[02:20:57.040 --> 02:21:01.040]   We mentioned his name a lot talking about security.
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:08.040]   EFF said that Kaminsky was a friend of freedom and embodiment of the true hacker spirit.
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:13.040]   The founder of Defcon and Black Hat suggested he should be inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame.
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:16.040]   I agree.
[02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:17.040]   I can go on and on.
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:19.040]   I think you're right, Stacey.
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:24.040]   Everybody should read Nicole Perroirath's story in the New York Times because it's really,
[02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:25.040]   really good.
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:26.040]   It's really, really good.
[02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:28.040]   The final quote is great.
[02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:31.040]   The Internet was never designed to be secure.
[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:33.040]   Mr. Kaminsky recalled in a 2016 interview.
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:37.040]   The Internet was designed to move pictures of cats.
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:40.040]   We are very good at moving pictures of cats.
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:43.040]   We didn't think you'd be moving trillions of dollars onto this.
[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:44.040]   What are we going to do?
[02:21:44.040 --> 02:21:47.040]   The answer is some of us have got to go out and fix it.
[02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:48.040]   He did.
[02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:52.040]   If you feel safe on the Internet, you can thank Dan Kaminsky.
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:55.040]   He'll be missed.
[02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:56.040]   I think we're ready.
[02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:59.040]   Can we do John?
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:01.040]   Can we do immersive mode in Zoom?
[02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:03.040]   Have you figured that out yet?
[02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:05.040]   Do we do immersive mode?
[02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:06.040]   This is new.
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:07.040]   I don't know.
[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:08.040]   We haven't tried it.
[02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:09.040]   What is it?
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:11.040]   Well, kids can virtually punch you.
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:13.040]   Do you want to say VR?
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:14.040]   No, it puts you in.
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:20.040]   I like what Stacey suddenly thought of as the very important use of immersive mode.
[02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:21.040]   I missed it.
[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:22.040]   What was it?
[02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:23.040]   Punch me.
[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:26.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:28.040]   See, Jeff's enthusiastic.
[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:29.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:30.040]   We can punch you.
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:31.040]   What is immersive mode?
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:32.040]   I don't get it.
[02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:38.040]   So if you've got a class, it looks like all the kids are sitting in rows in a class.
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:39.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:41.040]   Teams did the stages ago.
[02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:42.040]   This was a team's has this.
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:43.040]   There it is.
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:44.040]   Come on.
[02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:45.040]   Microsoft Teams had this.
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:52.440]   In fact, the NBA used Teams big monitors in the seats to pretend people were watching the
[02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:53.440]   basketball games.
[02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:54.440]   Oh, I didn't know.
[02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:56.440]   Well, that's how they all.
[02:22:56.440 --> 02:22:58.440]   Yeah, they were big monitors in the seats.
[02:22:58.440 --> 02:22:59.440]   Yeah.
[02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:00.440]   Teams has this.
[02:23:00.440 --> 02:23:06.440]   Teams is more like you're at a theatrical not, you know, seating.
[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:07.440]   Right.
[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:09.440]   This looks more like you're at a class bench.
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:10.440]   That's cool.
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:11.440]   Immersive mode.
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:12.440]   That's cool.
[02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:13.440]   Can you punch me with this?
[02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:14.440]   That would be good.
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:15.440]   Not in real life.
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:18.600]   I can just look like I'm punching you.
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:21.440]   In order for us to use it, you'd all have to be in the same Zoom meeting and you're
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:22.440]   not.
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:24.440]   Each of you has your own dedicated Zoom.
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:26.440]   Oh, right.
[02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:30.440]   But we've done it kind of here.
[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:32.440]   That's what we do with the avatars.
[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:34.120]   Yeah, you actually be kind of cool.
[02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:40.440]   You know, if we could simulate this table and put you at the table.
[02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:42.440]   Stacy's arm was just going.
[02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:43.440]   She would have no idea.
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:44.440]   Even if she was.
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:48.440]   She actually, she said, I could punch Leo.
[02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:50.440]   I was very excited about this.
[02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:51.440]   I know.
[02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:53.440]   It would make her sorry to disappoint you.
[02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:54.920]   You know what?
[02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:58.640]   One day Ant is going to be back in the studio and I'm just going to have Ant.
[02:23:58.640 --> 02:23:59.960]   It'll be a punch by proxy.
[02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:00.960]   Oh, geez.
[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:02.760]   I'd rather have you punch.
[02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:05.800]   Ant's arm is a registered weapon.
[02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:07.320]   You can't do that.
[02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:08.320]   I'm scared now.
[02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:11.240]   Instead of a full punch, I'll just have.
[02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:12.240]   But so scared.
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:14.800]   Also, Ant can use a little thing.
[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:17.160]   My punchy may be amazing.
[02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:18.160]   You don't know that.
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:21.640]   It's not mine.
[02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:22.640]   But it's not mine.
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:24.360]   I have seen Ant's biceps.
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:26.160]   I have been to the mountain.
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:27.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:30.680]   Stacy, that was a threat, Stacy.
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:32.160]   You want to watch the honor?
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:34.840]   She tried to hire me.
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:37.280]   You want to watch the kids guide to the internet from Yahoo?
[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:44.760]   Internet, cyber space, sex free, hello virtual reality, interactive appetite searching for
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:49.080]   a website, a window to the world, got to get online, take the spin now you're in with
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:51.880]   the techno set, you're going surfing on the internet.
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:56.720]   This was a VHS tape.
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:24:58.280]   Welcome to the Jameson family.
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:00.240]   Hey there, it's us again.
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:03.120]   This is my brother Peter, mom and dad, and I'm Dasha.
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:07.560]   Today, we're going to be showing our friends Andrew and Lisa the basics of the internet.
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:08.560]   And we thought you might be talking about it.
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:09.560]   Peter's definitely.
[02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:10.560]   It's a dangerous place.
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:14.480]   Peter, Peter, Peter is definitely up to something, something no good.
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:16.080]   I don't know about this Peter kid.
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:20.240]   When we installed internet access on our computer, I got the whole family involved.
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:21.240]   It's true.
[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:22.240]   Everybody had their own tasks to do.
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:23.240]   It was a lot of work.
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:25.320]   Don't you want to know where Peter is today?
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:26.680]   I'm really working here.
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:30.680]   Now that I've gotten on the internet, I'd rather be on my computer than doing just about
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:31.680]   anything.
[02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:33.680]   Uh huh, that's what I'm saying.
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:34.680]   Uh huh.
[02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:36.600]   What'd you find on the internet Peter?
[02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:38.160]   What is it exactly?
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:39.160]   Really cool.
[02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:43.040]   The internet gave us a whole world of exciting new possibilities.
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:45.960]   So I guess this is a story of how it changed our lives.
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:47.960]   I can meet girls on the internet.
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:54.600]   It does not look like a face of a guy who's pretending to be innocent, but really is up
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:55.600]   to no good.
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:56.600]   I'm just saying.
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:58.600]   I think we're hearing about Leo's channel.
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:25:59.600]   That's all teenage boys.
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:00.600]   Come on.
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:04.600]   Alright, get ready because we're going to do moral panic.
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:07.760]   What are you going to do about blood pressure?
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:08.760]   Oh no.
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:09.920]   Oh no.
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:14.760]   Is this the Washington Post brain interface story?
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:16.680]   Oh yeah, that put that in there.
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:20.440]   Your tech devices want to read your brain.
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:23.640]   What could go wrong?
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:28.240]   Something's never seen that.
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:32.360]   Hey, you could use your brain to just turn on the TV and turn it off.
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:33.600]   Isn't that cool?
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:37.960]   But ethics experts say they don't know what could happen.
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:40.560]   What is it going to find when it reads your brain?
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:42.800]   What could it put into your brain?
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:44.320]   It actually says that.
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:45.320]   It says, come on.
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:47.720]   Hey, a little, by the way, now this is not moral panic.
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:50.720]   This is really a scary story from the Washington Post.
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:56.400]   She never returned her VHS copy of Sabrina, the teenage witch.
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:58.920]   The DA's office happened to me.
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:04.600]   Twenty years later, she faces a felony charge.
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:09.400]   She was trying to change the name on her Texas driver's license when they ran a background
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:15.240]   check all they're seeing is these two words, felony embezzlement.
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:24.160]   So blockbuster back in like 1999 or 2000 sent a ton of people to collections for tapes
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:28.880]   that they either did or did not take out that were never returned.
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:30.040]   This happened to you.
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:32.840]   But this happened to me.
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:38.080]   Then I was in this habit, I did not get charged with a felony, but I did get sent to collections,
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:39.240]   which for me was a huge.
[02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:40.240]   Oh, that's terrible.
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:42.240]   No, that's almost worse than a movie.
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:43.240]   Because the blockbuster, yeah, blockbuster.
[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:45.960]   That's the jail you don't get out of.
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:50.000]   Had a, they had some sort of database error.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:56.000]   And what happened is people who took out movies like right after you on the card or something
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.360]   got attributed to your card.
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:00.680]   So they had me taking out some video.
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:01.680]   Oh, man.
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:02.680]   Oh, man.
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:07.040]   So this woman, and there's a bunch of people in the comments talking about it, but it's
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:12.320]   from the same era when blockbuster got super aggressive and had this whole database issue.
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:13.320]   They were jerks.
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:16.120]   And this woman didn't take that out.
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:19.880]   She said, but she was living with a guy who had kids.
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:23.280]   And she thinking he, he went and got it and didn't take it back.
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:31.480]   What's even funnier is the cast of Sabrina got into the act, including Melissa Joan Hart.
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:32.480]   Yes.
[02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:38.920]   Who, who did the shruggie emoji?
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:43.280]   Okay.
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:44.280]   That's terrible.
[02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:46.920]   No, this is what this was really surprising.
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:48.560]   Yeah.
[02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:55.520]   I remember once flying out of the country and I, and I remembered, Oh hell, I didn't return
[02:28:55.520 --> 02:28:56.520]   a video.
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:28:59.360]   And I thought I was going to come back bankrupt.
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:03.480]   Yeah, the fees just man up.
[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:06.840]   You know, compound interest works both ways, buddy boy.
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:07.840]   Yeah.
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:08.840]   Mm hmm.
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:10.760]   What a ridiculous industry that was.
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:11.760]   What a ridiculous industry.
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:13.400]   Taking a ridiculous industries.
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:16.040]   Verizon is looking to sell its media assets.
[02:29:16.040 --> 02:29:17.040]   Who didn't see that?
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:18.040]   Oh boy.
[02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:20.960]   How much did they pay for a Yahoo?
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:23.680]   And what else did they buy AOL?
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:24.680]   Cheers.
[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:25.680]   TechCrunch.
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:26.680]   TechCrunch.
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:28.480]   That came with AOL, I think, right?
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:33.120]   And equity firms among possible bidders for Yahoo and AOL.
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:38.000]   You mean naming it OAS didn't fix all the problems?
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000]   Yeah.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:46.280]   It's so Yahoo is now at this point a toxic asset that is so sad.
[02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:47.560]   Well, that's the other thing.
[02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:50.400]   There's another story of the rundown that says that Yahoo was killing cultures because
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:56.640]   it kills all these things like Yahoo answers, which as laughable as it was was part of the
[02:29:56.640 --> 02:29:58.040]   culture and it's just gone.
[02:29:58.040 --> 02:29:59.040]   Yeah.
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:00.040]   Yeah.
[02:30:00.040 --> 02:30:02.400]   There's no sense of archiving here.
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:08.600]   So it sold Tumblr off to WordPress for what is considered a nominal sum.
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:09.600]   They already wrote down.
[02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:12.000]   They could buy his back or not.
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:13.000]   No.
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:14.960]   Well, no, I don't think they brought back nudity.
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:15.960]   No.
[02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:16.960]   No.
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:21.160]   They already they spent about how much they spent on this thing.
[02:30:21.160 --> 02:30:22.520]   A lot of money.
[02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:30.640]   And billion dollars to acquire AOL and Verizon, it's thought they might get four to five billion
[02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:31.720]   selling it off.
[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:33.600]   So that's a fairly big write down.
[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:35.280]   Oh, oh, I don't believe that.
[02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:37.760]   They already wrote down four and a half billion in 2018.
[02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:41.400]   I mean, they knew it was a it was a turkey already.
[02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:47.600]   November, they sold HuffPost to BuzzFeed.
[02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:48.840]   Yahoo finance.
[02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:50.440]   Yahoo mail.
[02:30:50.440 --> 02:30:52.320]   Tech crunch and gadget.
[02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:57.760]   I mean, you know, they generated seven billion dollars of revenue in 2020.
[02:30:57.760 --> 02:31:00.040]   That's down.
[02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:04.960]   But I guess it's probably a money loser in the long run, right?
[02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:05.960]   Yeah.
[02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:08.600]   It was just like, why don't you keep an underperforming asset?
[02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:09.600]   Yeah.
[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:10.600]   Yeah.
[02:31:10.600 --> 02:31:12.400]   Yahoo is so laughable.
[02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:15.360]   But what if they had different leadership?
[02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:16.360]   What if someone else?
[02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:18.360]   Well, we've tried that.
[02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:22.680]   But what would you do with Yahoo?
[02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:23.600]   Where does the right lead?
[02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:25.600]   What would you do with Yahoo?
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:27.400]   What would you do with it?
[02:31:27.400 --> 02:31:28.400]   I don't know.
[02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:29.400]   You're the leader.
[02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:30.400]   You are now.
[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:31.400]   Congratulations.
[02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:32.400]   Don't make him the leader.
[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:33.400]   I'll leave that.
[02:31:33.400 --> 02:31:35.880]   I'd sell a lot of it off because yeah.
[02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:36.880]   Yeah.
[02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:39.160]   But no, what if someone that was like a Nadella?
[02:31:39.160 --> 02:31:41.920]   What if Elon Musk?
[02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:42.920]   Yeah.
[02:31:42.920 --> 02:31:43.920]   Yeah.
[02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:46.000]   No, possibly he's smart.
[02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:47.000]   No.
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:50.000]   The reason none of those people have bought Yahoo.
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.640]   Because they're smart.
[02:31:51.640 --> 02:31:54.960]   The reason, a telco bought Yahoo.
[02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:57.880]   It's good to see you.
[02:31:57.880 --> 02:31:58.880]   You do the math.
[02:31:58.880 --> 02:31:59.880]   Yeah.
[02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:00.880]   That's all I can say.
[02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:01.880]   Because Rupert Murdoch wouldn't even buy it.
[02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:03.720]   No one wanted it.
[02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:04.960]   It was a turkey.
[02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:10.240]   And Marissa Meyer is arguably the best possible person to try to turn it around.
[02:32:10.240 --> 02:32:11.520]   She couldn't even turn it around.
[02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:12.520]   I think it's.
[02:32:12.520 --> 02:32:15.760]   Do you think she's sitting out thinking I'll make a bid?
[02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:16.760]   No.
[02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:19.880]   That's her new thing is sunshine.
[02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:22.280]   You know about that?
[02:32:22.280 --> 02:32:26.920]   It's kind of a step down a little bit from running Yahoo.
[02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:28.120]   It's a contact list.
[02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:30.120]   Is that Reese Witherspoon's thing?
[02:32:30.120 --> 02:32:31.120]   No.
[02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:32.120]   Oh, okay.
[02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:34.000]   She's got sunshine.
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.520]   What's her sunshine?
[02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:38.600]   Is it sunshine.com?
[02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:40.680]   Maybe she's teaming up with Reese Witherspoon.
[02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:41.680]   No, Reese.
[02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:42.680]   I'm sorry.
[02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:43.680]   It's hello, sunshine.
[02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:44.680]   Oh, hello.
[02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:46.280]   This is just sunshine.
[02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:47.680]   This is contact manager.
[02:32:47.680 --> 02:32:50.120]   That's it.
[02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:52.960]   That's what Marissa Meyer is running these days.
[02:32:52.960 --> 02:33:01.960]   Actually, she partnered with the programmer she took from Google over here she is with,
[02:33:01.960 --> 02:33:03.960]   oh, what's his name?
[02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:04.960]   She took from Enrique.
[02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:10.040]   She took him over from Google to Yahoo and then on to sunshine.
[02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:11.040]   Right.
[02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:14.160]   I got to say, her fashion sense is still on point.
[02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:15.160]   Look at that.
[02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:16.160]   Wow.
[02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:17.160]   It's just a lot of times.
[02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:18.160]   Yeah.
[02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:19.160]   It is.
[02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:20.160]   It is.
[02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:21.160]   Yeah.
[02:33:21.160 --> 02:33:22.160]   He has always been amazing.
[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:23.160]   Yeah.
[02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:24.160]   Oh, yeah.
[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:25.160]   Okay.
[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:26.800]   Hey, are we, where are we in this show?
[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:29.560]   We are ready to do our picks of the week ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:29.560 --> 02:33:30.840]   Are we in the room Stacy?
[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:31.840]   She ran out of a cheese.
[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:32.840]   Halfway.
[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:33.880]   She's out of Jesus.
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:34.880]   That's it.
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:35.880]   She's fain.
[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:38.280]   She's ready for a trip to Skippy's Eggstore.
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:39.280]   Yeah.
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:41.920]   And we'll do that in a moment.
[02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:47.200]   Let's, let's in a bit the picks of the week.
[02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:54.600]   Stacy Higginbotham, before you pass out from lack of calories, what is your thing this
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:55.600]   week?
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:56.600]   Okay.
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:34:02.240]   So my goal for y'all is to come away with a good idea for a Mother's Day present.
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:03.240]   Oh.
[02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:07.680]   So I'm going to throw out some gadgets and ideas for you.
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:08.680]   Oh.
[02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:10.560]   It's appropriate to put to your mom.
[02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:11.560]   Okay.
[02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:12.560]   Love it.
[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:14.600]   If this, if this is interesting.
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:20.040]   So first up, not a tech gift, but a really good gift for many people in many parts of
[02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:21.040]   the country.
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:22.040]   Yes.
[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:31.040]   If your mom likes taking people outside an outdoor picnic blanket set up, this is a
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:32.040]   good gift.
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:33.040]   This is a good gift for anybody.
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:37.080]   Like a picnic basket, a blanket.
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:38.080]   Just get the blanket.
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:39.080]   Just get the blanket.
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:41.520]   Those things, the blankets useful for so many things.
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:45.840]   We, all through COVID, we kept one in our car because, you know, sometimes you get to
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:46.840]   take out our way.
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:47.840]   Anyway.
[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:51.440]   So you're saying give mom a corporate gimme blanket.
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:55.160]   No, no, no, she doesn't have to sell them at other places.
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:56.160]   I think L.L.
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:34:57.160]   Bean sells them.
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:01.760]   They don't give her, but like, look, mom, I've got a delight to blanket for you.
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:02.760]   Okay.
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:03.760]   You could also do that.
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:07.080]   And if you want to make it super special and you have the ability, pack a picnic and
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:08.240]   give it to her.
[02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:09.400]   I love that.
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:12.200]   And guess what, mom, you get to take home the blanket.
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:15.120]   Well, yeah, you're a winner.
[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:16.120]   Congratulations.
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:18.560]   You're going to try to phrase it a little bit better.
[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:22.360]   But yes, I would give her the blanket and have the basket.
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:23.760]   Yeah, that's better.
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:24.760]   Yeah.
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:27.000]   And then when she opens the blanket, you could be like, great.
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:28.720]   Now let's go to our, our picnic.
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:29.720]   All right.
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:34.320]   You could do what my wife did, which is gave me, gave me something and said, have my son
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:36.360]   wrap this and give it to me.
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:37.920]   That's a lot of fun.
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:38.920]   I love that.
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:42.160]   Honestly, honestly, honestly, the right thing to do.
[02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:44.200]   But go ahead.
[02:35:44.200 --> 02:35:50.040]   So around the holidays, I told you all about the $30 plant sensor that I bought.
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:51.040]   Yes.
[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:54.720]   And I have now had that for 167 days.
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:56.200]   It has told me.
[02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:58.960]   And I've changed the batteries once I'm about to change it again.
[02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:02.440]   So this is about six or seven months of having this thing.
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:03.440]   That's good.
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:04.440]   Yeah.
[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:05.440]   So it's still working.
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:09.080]   So for your mom and if you want, you can also pop a house plant in there.
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:10.160]   It's a Bluetooth sensor.
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:15.560]   I'm going to put it in the notes for Jason to make his life easier.
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:21.880]   And then the final idea, because this went over super well with my mom, is the Ember
[02:36:21.880 --> 02:36:24.680]   coffee mug, which is a connected heated coffee mug.
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:26.080]   I have love it.
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:28.520]   Mom would love that actually.
[02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:29.520]   Everybody loves this.
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:33.120]   I mean, it's, it is perfect as a gift because it's, it's kind of extravagant.
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:41.200]   The mug is like a hundred to $120 depending, but it's just so like, yes, it's a good gift.
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:44.920]   So those are, those are different price ranges, $30.
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:48.520]   The blankets range and two of them are good.
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:50.560]   So there's my mother's day.
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:51.560]   Very nice.
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:54.560]   If your mom's into these things, love it.
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:55.560]   Happy Mother's Day.
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:56.560]   Is that this Sunday?
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:36:57.560]   It is.
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:36:58.560]   Oh no.
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:36:59.560]   Here's the other thing.
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:00.640]   It's May nights, but the postal service is behind.
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:02.960]   So let me recommend next week you ship that card.
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:05.400]   That's a good point.
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:07.680]   Don't delay.
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:13.360]   I gave my mom a Worley pop and a six pound bag of popcorn.
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:14.840]   Yes.
[02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:16.280]   She liked it.
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:17.960]   She liked it a lot.
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:18.960]   Simple pleasures.
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:24.120]   Number of the week, Mr. J. Oh, you're muted.
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:25.120]   Hello.
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:27.120]   I had my analogies.
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:28.880]   I had a sneeze.
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:29.960]   Oh, yes.
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:36.840]   So the Oscars, if you remember them, averaged 9.85 million viewers on Sunday.
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:41.960]   In 1998, it was 55 million viewers.
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:44.560]   It was not exactly exciting.
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:47.960]   They were in a train station.
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:48.960]   Nice train station.
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:52.600]   Okay, it's a good train station, but still a train station.
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:56.200]   It reminded me of kind of the very first Oscars, which were about that size.
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:57.200]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:37:58.200]   They were back when?
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:37:59.200]   Yeah.
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:04.040]   But so I saw Axios said that theater operators were happy.
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:06.560]   I don't fully understand the rationale here.
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:08.720]   Kind of say, well, all your streaming stuff didn't work.
[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:11.160]   Oh, I don't know.
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:14.080]   I think people are saying movies, movies.
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:15.080]   I got Netflix.
[02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:16.880]   I got everything I want.
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:19.840]   I don't know if I need it.
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:21.280]   I'm glad no man.
[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:25.120]   One, I thought that was a really powerful movie.
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:31.040]   I also thought, I mean, Judas and the Black Messiah was really good.
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:36.640]   He won Best Supporting Actor.
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:41.820]   A little weird that they ended with, not Best Picture, which they always end with, but Best
[02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:42.820]   Actor.
[02:38:42.820 --> 02:38:47.400]   And I think they thought Steve Soderbergh was a director, big Hollywood director.
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:50.880]   I think Soderbergh thought it's going to be Chadwick.
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:39:01.200]   And we're going to end with this beautiful moment, this tearful moment, this proud moment.
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:02.840]   And it wasn't Bozeman.
[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:05.800]   He was nominated, but he did not win.
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:09.000]   And it just was kind of like a balloon with all the air light out.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:13.040]   I was just like, okay, poor Questlove had to say, well, that's been great.
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:14.040]   See ya.
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:16.480]   It was not good.
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:18.840]   This used to be a national holiday for me.
[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:20.920]   I was a little disappointed.
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:25.120]   But I didn't watch a single movie, so I don't know.
[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:27.920]   We used to try to watch all the movies.
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:29.920]   Yeah, I think that's over.
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:33.160]   Netflix led with Six Winds, Amazon with Two.
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:34.160]   That's actually a big story.
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:35.160]   They don't have.
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:36.160]   That's what's dominant.
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:37.160]   Yeah.
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:39.880]   Yeah, and they don't have the business, but at some point they can wave goodbye to theaters.
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:40.880]   They don't really care.
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:43.400]   They put them in the theaters, so they can win Oscars.
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:45.640]   That's what doesn't need it.
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:52.600]   Yeah, you remember that, who was it, was invading against the idea that a streaming
[02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:57.320]   movie should ever be nominated for an Academy Award that is should be in theaters.
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:03.440]   But economics has a way of trumping your heart.
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:04.440]   So that's it.
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:05.440]   That's my number.
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:07.120]   Yeah, very low numbers.
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:10.760]   Lowest rated Academy Awards ever.
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:15.560]   At least watched lowest rated.
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:19.800]   Mr. Antepruit, what's your pick this week?
[02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:20.800]   I have three.
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:26.880]   The first one is I finally created an NFT because water like nuts.
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:28.360]   I hope you get rich.
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:30.400]   I hope you get rich.
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:32.600]   What are we bidding in Ethereum?
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:33.600]   Ethereum.
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:34.600]   Ethereum.
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:35.600]   Look at the cat.
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:37.440]   I call it what the hell cat.
[02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:38.640]   What the hell cat?
[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:41.760]   You could own this fine cat.
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:42.760]   You'd be the owner of this.
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:43.760]   It's really cool.
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:44.760]   It's really big.
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:45.760]   I like the picture.
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:51.040]   Yeah, I snapped that photo not too long ago, but then I just decided to have some fun with
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:54.240]   post processing and editing and put flames.
[02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:57.240]   And fire behind the hell cat.
[02:40:57.240 --> 02:41:00.960]   Minimum bid currently .5 Ethereum.
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:03.040]   Sail ends tomorrow.
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:05.000]   Hurry, hurry, hurry to.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:08.560]   And I'm going to re-list it just to stick it out there because again, why not?
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:10.920]   It's not costing me much of anything.
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:13.480]   Actually, that's who makes the money in these NFTs, right?
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:17.640]   You have to go to a company to generate the NFT and they take some money.
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:22.520]   Yeah, they it's just like any other place that hosts content.
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:23.520]   How much does it cost?
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:24.520]   Pay for it.
[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:25.520]   It ranges.
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:30.160]   I think I put in, I think it was $30 or something like that.
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:31.160]   Okay.
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:32.160]   It was nothing.
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:34.320]   Do they take a cut of the sail?
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:38.160]   No, not on that particular contract.
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:43.040]   So is this a lot of, I did a little reading over the weekend on this stuff and that's how
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:44.560]   I ended up on that particular contract.
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:46.360]   That's a good way to learn about it too.
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:47.360]   Yeah.
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:50.080]   You're now our NFT resident NFT expert.
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:54.840]   No, not an expert, but I do have something out of the world.
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:58.080]   So the, so the, just as much as anybody, Antperuit.com/NFT.
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:41:59.080]   What else?
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:01.960]   That's a way to get to it.
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:03.640]   Next I did another short film.
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:05.000]   This one's a lot shorter.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:10.000]   And I did it in basically the first time you say testing.
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.640]   Lisa showed me this and she was so proud of you.
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:13.840]   She thought this was so good.
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:15.400]   Is this with a Canon?
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:17.240]   That's with the Sony.
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:18.240]   Sony A1.
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:19.240]   A1.
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:25.800]   But that took an old video of the hard hit and decided to redo it with a new video and
[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:32.680]   he was, he obliged, which reminds me there, their first track meet as of right now actually.
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:33.680]   Oh.
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:34.680]   And I'm sorry you're missing it.
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:35.680]   Oh, nice.
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:36.680]   Get out of here.
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:37.680]   Go.
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:38.680]   Oh, we're going.
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:40.680]   But that's my short and I had fun with that.
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:44.680]   So I went off the camera and just sort of going down memory lane with him.
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:46.440]   So I like your ass.
[02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:47.540]   That's nice.
[02:42:47.540 --> 02:42:50.560]   So this was the old, this is the old video that you made.
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:54.000]   That was about four years ago, I think, or three years ago, something like that.
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:55.840]   Gosh, he's a grown man now.
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:57.440]   Look at him.
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:00.360]   He's, he looks more mature than when I met him.
[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:02.520]   Not even was about a year ago.
[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:03.520]   Mm hmm.
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:04.520]   Yeah.
[02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:05.520]   He's got a lot of money.
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:06.520]   He's got a lot of money.
[02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:07.520]   He's got a lot of money.

[02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:16.000]   If you subscribe in your favorite podcast player and say download it whenever it's available,
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:20.680]   you get it automatically and that's kind of nice the minute the show comes out.
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:25.160]   If you are watching asynchronously like that, if you're downloading, don't forget we have

[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:40.680]   I'll see you next week.
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:41.680]   Bye bye.
[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:57.120]   Hey, if you like tech news, but you also like hearing about it from the people who are actually
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:48:58.120]   writing the stories.
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:48:59.840]   Well, I've got a show for you.
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:04.880]   It's called Tech News Weekly and it's me, Jason Howell along with my co-host Micah Sargent
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:05.880]   every week.
[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:09.960]   We invite the people making and breaking the biggest tech news stories from around the
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:13.560]   web onto this show to talk to us about it.
