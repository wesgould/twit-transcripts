[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.680]   Verse and the cloud and our great hosts
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.480]   who really make this show as smart and useful as it is,
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.520]   starting to my left with Gina Tripani of smarter word.org.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.400]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.920]   Hi.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.520]   Great to see you.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.480]   Great to see you again.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.200]   Are you?
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.760]   I am.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.600]   I'm setting up something we'll talk about this episode.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.760]   Fro-yo.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.760]   We got Fro-yo.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.760]   Oh, yes.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.280]   Oh, yes.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280]   Oh, yes.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.760]   Yes.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.680]   Jeff Jarvis got his Fro-yo too from BuzzMachine.com.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.720]   Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.520]   I pushed to you, eh?
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.760]   Finally, Saturday morning.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.480]   Yep.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.720]   I got mine Friday night, so yeah.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.840]   Yeah, Saturday night.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.360]   So for those who don't yet have 2.2 on the Nexus 1,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.000]   you'll get a message-- I presume everybody does,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.040]   but you'll get a message that says there's a system update.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.720]   You don't have to go check every five minutes.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.080]   You know what?
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.360]   I didn't get the message.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.320]   You didn't?
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.920]   And then I went to check because I'm just neurotic and I'm
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.960]   going to life.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.360]   And that's what it said.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.320]   Oh, you've been downloaded.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.880]   Oh.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.200]   I'll install it now.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.800]   Cool.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.000]   Yeah, I got the dialog box with a cute little robot.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.280]   You want to do it?
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.720]   I'll do it.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.800]   So now that we all three of us have--
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.600]   I guess it's FRF91 is the official release.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.360]   What do you think?
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.280]   Are there reviews in?
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.480]   Jeff, have you noticed a speed difference?
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.640]   I have enough stuff.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.400]   At least he was a little faster.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.440]   I'm just happy I have it.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.760]   But it's the kind of letdown.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.680]   What's he yelled for?
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.680]   I know.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.280]   I didn't say OK.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.000]   What's the big deal?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.760]   I have to say, it's little things, though.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.000]   Like having the phone icon and the browser icon always
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.960]   there, which means you could pull it off your screen.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.080]   And those are the things that you really do want always
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.920]   there, little things like that.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.320]   The speed--
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.880]   Definitely.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah, it's much faster.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.960]   That dock is great.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.800]   I don't know how I lived without a portable hotspot.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.040]   I've been traveling a lot.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.440]   So I had the test build.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.760]   And I use it all the time now.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.800]   Just pop it up.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.720]   Make a hotspot, especially traveling.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.680]   So I have to pay the 12 bucks in the airport, whatever.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.160]   It's still no word from T-Mobile about whether they want
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.040]   to charge for that.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.080]   I mean, the AT&T now has tethering.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   Sprint has tethering.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.240]   But both cases, they charge you 20 to 30 bucks extra month.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.880]   It's so far, we don't pay for this.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.200]   Just part of your bandwidth.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.320]   And I mean, I haven't used gigabytes and gigabytes.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.440]   I literally just kind of use it just a little bit here
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.160]   and there on traveling.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.320]   But I haven't had a problem at all.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.920]   And I haven't seen any effect in my bill.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.600]   So I'm just going to not say anything.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.120]   Be happy.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.760]   Be happy while we can.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.280]   Well, team levels in that position,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.440]   where they really do want to make people happy because they're
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.080]   kind of an also ran network.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.520]   They've been upgrading their 3G network in New York.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.040]   Have you noticed that yet?
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.440]   Jeff, a higher speed uploads your downloads?
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.000]   Not really.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.520]   I'm going out in the burbs pretty much.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.920]   And I get no coverage at home.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.520]   Oh, that's too bad.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.280]   Are you tempted by the iPhone 4?
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Oh.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.360]   Are we going to switch back?
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.120]   Are we?
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.920]   I don't know.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.520]   We put so much pressure on--
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.720]   let me let you off the hook.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.280]   I am using it.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.200]   I'm using the iPhone 4 right now.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.680]   Oh.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.520]   What's your--
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.560]   The robot is sad.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.120]   The robot is sad robot.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.320]   What's your thought, Jeff?
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.680]   Well, my thought is that I'll cancel my AT&T laptop card.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.200]   Right.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.240]   And use that to pay for keeping the T-Mobile because, you know,
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.280]   it's a business expense for being on this weekend.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.280]   Google.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.120]   Yeah, right.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.280]   You got to review the phone.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.120]   And with the--
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.520]   what is it?
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.880]   $60 plan?
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.720]   It's not a whole lot more than a MyFi, for instance.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.240]   It's the same.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.640]   No, it's not.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   Right.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.440]   And I do still use the Android for my mail and everything.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.440]   I prefer the Gmail client there.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.120]   I like it better.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.120]   Here's what I did touch.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.960]   I saw Clayton Morris at Fox, and I touched the X, the Verizon--
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.520]   Ooh.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.040]   Right.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.520]   Next.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.320]   It's nice.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.400]   Big screen.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.520]   He's like screen was too large.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.000]   I liked large because I'm old.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.120]   Well, and it's not--
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.080]   that's not the only one.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.440]   There's also now-- and T-Mobile has one of these, the Galaxy S
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.480]   Android phones.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.280]   And these have a four inch.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.320]   So they're in between the Nexus 1 and the extra large screen
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.440]   of the Android X or the EVO.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.840]   They're four inch screens.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.760]   And they're these new Samsung AMOLEDS, which
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.800]   are supposedly just incredible.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.320]   And they're kind of thin.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.640]   The T-Mobile one does not have a slide out keyboard.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.480]   There are versions with a slide out keyboard.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.400]   It's a whole line of Android phones from Samsung
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.040]   that the people are also raving about.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.240]   So there's some good choices.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.840]   But I have to say, I still like--
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.000]   I like having 2.2, which you can't yet
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.360]   get on any other handset legitimately.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.440]   I like the slimness and the form factor of the Nexus 1.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.680]   It's small.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.400]   It's easy to carry.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.640]   And I have to say now, having carried around the iPhone
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.320]   for a couple of weeks solely, I do miss Google Voice integration.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.600]   I miss that hugely.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.640]   I don't even know how to--
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.440]   I mean, on the iPhone, all my messages are on Google Voice.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.120]   And I can't even figure out how to get them.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.040]   It's like, well, what do I do?
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.840]   I have to go online.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.880]   What do I do?
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.080]   And then I also miss the better notifications
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.640]   that Android offers.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.080]   It just does not work very well on the iPhone still.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.160]   So there are some legitimate reasons
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.960]   to say stick with the Nexus 1.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.440]   Tethering is free.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.280]   I think while the screen is not as high res as the red in this play,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.400]   it's the next best screen out there.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.120]   Google Voice integration, notifications.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.800]   What else?
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.880]   Are there any other things?
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.960]   Ethics, open.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.120]   It's open.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.440]   Making Gina happy.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.920]   Yeah, actually, that's the only reason that Jeff and I use it, Gina.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.280]   It's because of you.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.200]   I also really-- I like the widgets.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.120]   I like home screen widgets.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.960]   I never thought I'd say that because I'm not
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.520]   much of a widget or gadget gal in general.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.400]   But now, I just-- I love the search box front and center,
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.240]   which you have on the iPhone.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.360]   But I use the Mint widget.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.880]   I use the Pandora widget.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.160]   I use the Power widget, where you can toggle on Wi-Fi Bluetooth
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.040]   brightness really easily.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.480]   I use the news widget.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.560]   I mean, I've just got widgets.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.800]   I've got to use the 4-square widget.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.920]   So I really like that.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.680]   Your phone's just not just like grid of--
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.720]   Show us your home screen.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.480]   This is one thing I miss on the iPhone
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.080]   is the ease of taking screenshots.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.480]   You're going to have to tilt it a little bit
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.800]   because of the--
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.360]   You have a lot of icons in your home screen.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.280]   You're not heavily widgetized.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:35.960]   Not too much.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.840]   That's that one.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.320]   I got a one-row--
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.960]   I only have one row of widgets.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.560]   I don't want to show you my Mint widget
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.560]   because it shows my network.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.560]   I know.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.060]   I know.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.560]   In fact, I'm kind of amazed that you have
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.440]   your Mint widget on there.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.480]   I tried it for a while.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.320]   But wait a minute.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.000]   Do I want to broadcast that number?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.880]   Yeah, it's personal.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.520]   Well, this is the thing.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.160]   I have it on to a screen off to the side.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.660]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.800]   So you kind of have to really dig into my phone to see it.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.280]   But yeah, I've got one page that's just widgets.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.760]   You know, the search box, the Power widget, the Mint widget,
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.840]   and then the Pandora widget.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.920]   And I use the Buzz widget, which I like.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.160]   The camera and the iPhone is a little bit better.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.040]   But the Nexus one's camera's pretty good.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.400]   Have you tried any video editing on the iPhone yet?
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.240]   Yeah, it's hard to do with your little--
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.240]   on that.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.680]   --like fat fingers.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.360]   And they just shipped an update that might fix it.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.600]   But there were a number of bugs and crashes.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.560]   But they just shipped out one-on-one of IMOIs.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.680]   Does that update have the more bars?
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.280]   Not yet.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.080]   It's my three of--
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.200]   spinal tap.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.560]   They're going to have 11 bars.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.960]   It goes to 11.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.360]   My phone goes to 11.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.560]   Yeah, they say the fix for the antenna issue
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.240]   is we're going to--
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.200]   we talked about this a lot on Twitter and other shows.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.280]   I don't want to belabor the point.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.000]   But we were stunned, says Apple, stunned to learn
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.920]   that we've been doing it wrong for the last three
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.840]   phones.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.120]   We've been showing you too many bars.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.960]   It's your hip no time.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.000]   You won't believe anything we say.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.320]   On the face of it seemed like they're kind of saying
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.760]   we were misrepresenting the figure at first.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.320]   They definitely were.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   And what, AT&T did a whole ad campaign around bars.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.360]   I mean, this whole bar indicator is kind of a human.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.200]   I mean, people-- users can expect it now.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.720]   But it's really like you either drop the call
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.640]   or you don't drop the call.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.560]   It's more binary, which is what you were talking about on Twitch.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.200]   This was Jerry Pournell.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.520]   His point was it either works or doesn't work.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.440]   What's with the bars?
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.640]   Just a light that says you have a connection or you don't.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.160]   That's all they need.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.640]   Right.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.640]   I had a reader write me and say-- or listener write me and say
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.200]   that he could make the Nexus 1 lose bars
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.320]   if he put his finger on the bottom right of the phone.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.720]   And I'm actually able to reproduce that.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.600]   Oh, there you go.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.040]   So I mean, every phone has this issue.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.280]   So we'll give Apple kind of the pass on that.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.080]   Maybe not the pass on exposing the antenna.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.560]   But yeah, their response was funny.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.400]   We're stunned.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.000]   We're stunned.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.400]   Oh, we were shocked.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.240]   It reminds me so much of Casablanca.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.320]   I'm shocked-- Cloud Reigns.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.280]   I'm shocked the gambling is going on.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.160]   Here's your winnings.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.000]   Here's your winnings.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.400]   I am shocked.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.880]   So one of the stories in the pile today
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.480]   is there will be no Nexus 2.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.080]   That's a surprise.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.080]   Yeah, it is.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.000]   Maybe not as much a surprise because they've kind of been
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.640]   leading up to this.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.480]   They said a few weeks ago they weren't going to sell it.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.160]   Google was going to stop selling it directly.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.480]   Do they say why no Nexus 2?
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.600]   Just kind of they didn't need it.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.000]   That the Nexus 1 did its job and taught them
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.920]   all these lessons and it set a standard.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.600]   That's fine.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.680]   And now we move on.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.480]   Well, I guess they learn businesses
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.640]   they're not good at, even Google.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.320]   I am reading an Android.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.520]   It's funny.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.000]   Times changed so fast if we don't remember six months ago.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.560]   I'm reading an Android book that came out in January.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.520]   And it kind of made--
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.320]   It's almost fun, Leah.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.840]   Chad, I think I took a little time back and time off.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.440]   I'm going to read an Android book.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.280]   I'm sure Gene is doing the same thing.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.760]   It's an Android programming book.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.040]   They go too fast.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.960]   You can't get a book.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.800]   Things have changed by the time of publishing.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.560]   This is the first one.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.280]   It just came out that has 2.0 in it.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:17.320]   But what they say there is between the G1 and these other--
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.360]   and they really were mostly talking about the Droid and the G1.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.160]   And it's different.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.320]   And they were kind of celebrating the fact
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.560]   that Google was going to put out a phone with a kind of define
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.520]   a Google Android experience that would then
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.760]   be the set the standard.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.800]   Then we still don't see those phones
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.480]   when you get it from HTC.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.960]   You've got HTC Sense.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.800]   When you get it from Motorola, you've got Blur on top of it.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.000]   Even this new Samsung has some Samsung sugar on top of it
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.160]   to make it look like a different from the Google experience.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.720]   And that is one reason why I kind of want
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   to stick with the Nexus 1.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.600]   It is at least kind of a pure experience.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.800]   Yeah, I really like the Nexus 1.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.800]   I'm sad about the known Nexus 2.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.720]   Well, Droid X, anyone?
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.080]   But then you have the--
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.680]   Is it the motor?
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.480]   We have to go to this button.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.960]   You have CDMA, but you have a network that works.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.800]   You have a network that-- an expensive network,
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.760]   but it's a network that works.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.280]   Right.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.600]   It is a tough one.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.240]   It is.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.120]   So Google acquires ITA.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.520]   What is the meaning of the $700 million
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.680]   to basically buy a database that they were leasing before?
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.880]   Well--
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.680]   Yeah, I think it is the airline booking company, right?
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.680]   So in the past, that airline data has been available,
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.680]   I guess, by rental.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.680]   Mm-hmm.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.680]   But now Google owns the data.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.680]   Is this a response to Bing?
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.680]   I think it's a response to a business opportunity.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.680]   I think that it's a huge transactional area.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.680]   It's probably the biggest e-commerce area there is,
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.680]   travel.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.680]   I don't know how much advertising they get from airlines.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   Are they going to piss off the airlines by competing with them?
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.680]   Are they going to make the airlines happy by giving them business?
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.680]   Marissa Meyer, I'm trying to look for the clip now,
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.680]   made some reference to being able to create new kinds of searches.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   Like, how far can I get for this much money in seven hours?
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   That's what she says.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.680]   She says, "We anticipate being able to build in some flights
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.680]   or capabilities in terms of flight tracking
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.680]   and in terms of being able to buy particular flights.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.680]   Where can I get within seven hours and within this price?"
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.680]   But can't they do that by renting the data?
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.680]   Well, they don't do it at all right now.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.680]   I mean, they send you over to, you know,
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.680]   Priceline or somewhere else if you do a search.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   But you're right, though, Jeff, when you say it's a business
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.680]   possibly, it's more than just adding to their search because
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.680]   I'm just looking at who their clients are.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   The airlines use it.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.680]   Kayak uses it.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.680]   Bing uses it.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.680]   This is the ITA database.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.680]   Orbitz uses it.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.680]   Hotwire uses it.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.680]   So they may make money is what you're saying,
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   even though it was $700 million.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.680]   It's like when Nokia bought, what was it, Navtech?
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.680]   Right.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   They bought them in Navtech.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.680]   It's a similar kind of core data.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.680]   Google, I don't be careful not to get in antitrust trouble,
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.680]   but that's one of the things that makes its money is by
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.680]   still serving all those companies.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.680]   And the question is, what can they do on top of it?
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.680]   Reading an article from Clint Bolton's Google Watch in E-Week.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.680]   He quotes Eric Schmidt on the call when they announced the deal
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.680]   on July 1st.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.680]   I think it's unlikely that we will, that we, anything we do
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.680]   with this data will look anything like what's available today.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.680]   So it sounds like a new product maybe from Google.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.680]   Marissa Meyer says, "We anticipate being able to build in some
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.680]   flight search capabilities."
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.680]   This is what you were talking about in terms of flight tracking
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.680]   and in terms of being able to buy particular flights.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.680]   The quote that you use, "Where can I get within seven hours and
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.680]   within this price?"
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   That is exactly what Bing does right now.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   It's what Kayak does, what other companies do as well.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.680]   This Google Alerts idea for travel is interesting.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.680]   If you search yesterday for a flight which is about to sell out
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.680]   today, you get an alert.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.680]   Oh, I like that.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.680]   That's sweet.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.680]   So you know, oh, there's a seat left, go.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.680]   Does anybody want to...
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.680]   Okay, I'm not exactly foot-loose and fancy-free, neither you,
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   Jeff, but maybe, Gina, would you ever make a search
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.680]   for "I got this much money and I got seven hours, where can I go?"
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.680]   You know, I really want to be a kind of person who does that type of thing.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   That's a bizarre search.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.680]   Go ahead, Gina.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   Go ahead.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.680]   Search now.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.680]   You're young, you're foot-loose and fancy-free.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   Life your bike to the airport.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   Go to Bora Bora, like that.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.680]   I know, it makes me feel like I should be acting a little more,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.680]   but you know, kayak did that thing, kayak.com/explore,
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   where it would kind of give you, um,
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.680]   possibly places that you could travel right now.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.680]   I kind of look at it again, but I remember looking at it again,
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.680]   and I was like, "I swear, I almost booked a flight to Hawaii."
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.680]   Really?
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.680]   I'm...
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.680]   It's the equivalent of those recipe programs where you say what's in your
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.680]   refrigerator and it says what you can make.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.680]   Exactly, right.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.680]   Where can I fly for how much?
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.680]   There's a little slider you say, "I'm going to take off from Los Angeles.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   I've got, you know, 600 bucks, and I'm thinking about, you know,
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.680]   summer to 2010 or fall of 2010."
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.680]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.680]   It's pretty...
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.680]   I mean, it's pretty cool just to kind of, you know, fantasize.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.680]   That's gimmicky, but it's cool.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.680]   It's gimmicky, but it's cool.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.680]   But no, I generally don't say where can I go in the next seven hours
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   for 500 bucks or something.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.680]   I just wanted, because you hear these kinds of things all the time,
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.680]   people...
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   And, you know, you could get emails at last minute, you know,
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   $50 flight.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.680]   Do people really do that?
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.680]   Do they say, "Oh, good.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.680]   Let's go."
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.680]   You know, I mean, there was a business, it was a call last minute,
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.680]   and it started in the UK.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.680]   It did that well, because I think the UK and Europe has had the really
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.680]   cheap airlines, so you suddenly, you know, "Let's go to Croatia.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.680]   It's only $10."
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.680]   And you could do that kind of thing.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.680]   You know, our equivalent is, "Let's go to Indianapolis.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.680]   They'll pay me $10."
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   No offense to who she was.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.680]   My wife briefly in her youth was a courier.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.680]   I don't know if you could still do this, but as long as you could
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.680]   drop a hat go somewhere, you would get a call in the morning
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.680]   that said, "We need you to fly a courier bag to, you know,
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.680]   New York."
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.680]   And you get the bag, you have to be able to leave immediately.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.680]   And then you get to be in New York for as long as you want,
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.680]   and you have a return flight.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.680]   I guess if you're young--
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.680]   Nowadays, a mule.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.680]   A mule, yeah.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.680]   No, you didn't have balloons and cocaine up her, but this was just a
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.680]  -- It was like a courier bag.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.680]   What are you talking?
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.680]   Actually, I don't know.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.680]   I should ask.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.680]   I shouldn't assume.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.680]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.680]   The old days, too.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.680]   I shouldn't assume.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.680]   I mean, the other thing is, I had to fly to Montreal to do a
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.680]   conference about two months ago, and I couldn't believe how much
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.680]   the price was going up, up, up, up, up.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.680]   And there's some arbitrage opportunity here that usually gets
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.680]   done on the empty seats one way, but I wonder whether there's
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.680]   another business opportunity here, because the prices can go
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   wacky, and if you really know how many seats there are available
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.680]   across the market, what new transparency can you bring to
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.680]   that market?
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.680]   Right.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.680]   That's a good point.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.680]   This is the promise of the Internet, friction-free commerce.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.680]   And sure ain't with airlines.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.680]   Perfect information makes you a perfect consumer.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.680]   Right.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.680]   And if you're a free market fan, you should love this because it
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   makes the market work better.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.680]   You know, supply and demand works better.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.680]   Sure.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   It should.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   Sure.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.680]   And the airlines, you're exactly right.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.680]   They don't want anybody to know this because you could be
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.680]   sitting next to somebody who paid one quarter what you paid for
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.680]   that ticket, and they don't want you to know that because they
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.680]   know you'd be livid.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.680]   Though I argued that if you, of course, if they're making the
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   real high end on those last minute tickets, this is exposed
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.680]   as other stupidity.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:46.680]   But I argued in my book, long times as I made a plug, that at
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.680]   some point the airline would be wise to let us have an open
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.680]   market place in seats.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.680]   Right.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.680]   That's one time, a friend of mine died of AIDS many years ago,
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.680]   and my flight to Boston for his funeral was canceled, and I was
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.680]   desperate to get to Boston.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.680]   And they weren't going to do any buyout.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   So I said, I'll pay.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   You know, anybody want $100?
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.680]   I'll take your seat.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.680]   $200.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.680]   Take your seat.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.680]   Nobody did.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.680]   It thought it was like an auction.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.680]   Right.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.680]   But at some point there's a marketplace there that if the
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.680]   airline, I mean, where this really goes, I think, if you had an
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   open booking system where you knew, look at this flight, Google's
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   knowledge of the world comes from what we ask.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.680]   Do we have the flu?
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.680]   Right.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.680]   Google knows best.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.680]   Right.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   So in this case, wow, a lot of people are searching for
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.680]   flights to X.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.680]   Why don't we get to the point at some point where the airline says,
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.680]   oh, crap, I'm going to put on an extra plane.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.680]   No crap.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.680]   Nobody's going.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.680]   I'm going to consolidate these.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.680]   I'm going to do it early, and I'm going to pay you for this and
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.680]   give you discounts.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.680]   Right.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.680]   Do you bring some by having that Uber knowledge and analysis can
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.680]   Google bring some sense to the marketplace?
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.680]   But then, of course, I always read too much of this.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.680]   I thought that buzz worked.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   So what do we know?
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.680]   We're the fools that like buzz.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.680]   I can fly to Yuma, Arizona right now for $230.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   Oh, no.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:17.680]   I'm going to bet you can go to Indianapolis for us.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.680]   Yuma, I'd rather go to, well, Yuma might be a little hot right
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   now.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.680]   I bet it is.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.680]   I think we should just stay right where we are.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.680]   Finish this show, which we'll do in a moment, but first a word
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.680]   from Citrix.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   Nice.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.680]   You like that?
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   Jeff Jarvis, Gina Tarpani, are here.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   We're talking about the Google verse, and we have much more to
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.680]   talk about in just a bit before we do that.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   I do want to tell you about GoToAssist.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   If you're in the support business, whether it's personal,
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   you know, you support family and friends, or you work in IT or
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.680]   you have software that you support, you should know about GoToAssist
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   Express.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.680]   It is built on that great foundation, that remote access
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.680]   foundation that Citrix is so famous for.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:06.680]   GoToAssist takes that and tools it for people in support.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   For instance, your support is your clients or family or
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   friends don't have to have it installed at first.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   They can be on a Mac or Windows, doesn't matter.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   Go right now.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   You can install it.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.680]   You do need to install it first.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.680]   Go to assist.com/twig and you can do it free for 30 days.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.680]   Now, when they say help, you give them a link.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.680]   That's all.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.680]   They go there.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.680]   The software is installed 30 seconds later.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.680]   You're inside the computer.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   By the way, you could set it up for unattended support so they
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.680]   don't have to wait until they're home.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.680]   You can help many time as long as they allow you to, obviously,
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   for security reasons.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.680]   It does tell you what operating system is on there, what security
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   software, anything running in the background.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.680]   You could drag and drop fixes or installs from your computer to
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.680]   theirs.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.680]   Here's the best part for the busy support professional.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.680]   Eight systems simultaneously, if you need to.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.680]   Start and install on one.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.680]   Never wait.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.680]   Go to the next one.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.680]   Go to the next one.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.680]   Go to the next one.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   There's some really nice features.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.680]   The best.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   128-bit SSL, of course, so you can use it on an open Wi-Fi
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.680]   access spot, but you don't have to worry about that.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.680]   It's completely secure.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.680]   You can share your screen with your support.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   If they want to show you what's going on, you're seeing
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   their screen.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.680]   But if you want to say, oh, this is what it should look like,
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.680]   you could share your screen back.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.680]   I can go on and on.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.680]   I think you should just try it free.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   Please go to assist.com/twig-g-o-t-o-assist.com/twig-30-days-free.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.680]   Boom.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   You're going to love it.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   I should really warn you, you're going to get hooked.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.680]   Thanks, Citrix, so much for other support of this week in
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.680]   Google.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.680]   I can't read Hebrew, so I wasn't able to use it.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.680]   Do you read Hebrew?
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.680]   No, I said Google can for you.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.680]   Google did a decent translation of this article, didn't it?
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:03.680]   It's a Calcalist, which is an Israeli-- I gather kind of like
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.680]   blog of some sort-- financial newspaper sort of.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.680]   They had an interview with Gaurav Jain, who is the Android
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.680]   product manager, and he confirmed for the first time that
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.680]   Google's music service will launch alongside of Android 3
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   Gingerbread holiday 2010.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   So now there's two things for you to demand, Jeff.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:33.680]   Your gingerbread, and just the time for Christmas, or Hanukkah.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.680]   And you can ask for Google music.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   We're still waiting for the other shoot-a-drop with Apple.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   They acquired a streaming music service called Lala, and I
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.680]   thought by now they would have launched something.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.680]   There are continual rumors that Apple's going to do an
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.680]   streaming iTunes service.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.680]   Google can Google compete with Apple in this marketplace?
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.680]   They really own right now.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.680]   Apple does.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.680]   I mean, Gina, are you using your Android for-- and whatever that--
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   Let's ask the token young person.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.680]   Hey, token young person.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.680]   You know, the iTunes to Android transition was difficult for
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.680]   me.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.680]   I spent years-- I invested years into organizing my iTunes
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   playlist.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.680]   So I started-- I moved over to Double Twist, which can
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.680]   import your iTunes playlist.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   But, you know, Double Twist, it's good.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.680]   It's not quite as good.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   And, you know, basically, long story short, I don't use my
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.680]   Nexus One as a music player very much.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   I'm using the Pandora on it right now, which I like.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.680]   I would like to see better music capabilities in general.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   I think that media is one of Android's weaker points.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.680]   And I hope that it gets stronger, for sure.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   So I'm looking forward to this, but I got to tell you,
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.680]   Apple really has that down, for sure.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   As well as Google has the cloud stuff down, I feel like Apple
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.680]   has the media playback stuff down.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   We were talking last week about-- sorry.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   No, no.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   We were talking last week about the curation piece of this with
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   Google Marketplace.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.680]   It's true somewhat, I think, with Apple, too.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   It's partly seeing what they recommend.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.680]   They've got an editorial function in the iTunes store.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.680]   Which is exactly what Google has resisted doing.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.680]   And, as you said, we suggested they do this in the store.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.680]   Do you trust Apple?
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   I guess you do.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.680]   With music?
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   Yeah, they're good recommendations.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.680]   Have you seen Groosheark?
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   I'm not that groovy.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   I haven't played with it too much.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.680]   I didn't know about it, but somebody sent me a playlist via
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   Groosheark.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.680]   And the idea is you can listen to streaming music.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.680]   It's free.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.680]   I think it's legal.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.680]   I think it's legal.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.680]   It uses Flash, so it's not really very good for mobile.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   Although they-- well, let's see.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.680]   They do have a mobile.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.680]   Oh, look at Android.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.680]   Oh, look at BlackBerry, Nokia, Palm.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   They don't have an iPhone version, but they do have an
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.680]   iPhone version.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.680]   So that's interesting.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.680]   And this is streaming music.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   Do you think that streaming is going to take over storing your
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.680]   MP3s on your phone's memory card?
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   Yes.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.680]   I think it's just-- I mean, you really have to have a good network.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   You'd have to be on Not Wi-Fi, or you have to have a strong 3G
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.680]   connection, really, for that to work well, right?
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.680]   I've been playing with the Pandora app, and it's-- it sticks.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.680]   Does it really?
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.680]   It's a great--
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.680]   Really?
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.680]   I assume that that was just a matter of bandwidth.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   I was visiting family and--
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.680]   It is.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.680]   --an edge network.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   I didn't have a--
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680]   Oh, you were on the edge?
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   Yeah, I won't work on the edge, but it will work on the 3G fairly
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   well.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.680]   So I mean, I'm just trying to imagine going to the gym and
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.680]   bringing up my workout playlist--
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.680]   It's not what you're going to write to.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.680]   --over 3G or the Wi-Fi.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.680]   I think the reason-- well, here's the arguments for streaming.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.680]   You've got the absolute argument against it.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   It requires significant bandwidth.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   The arguments for it-- first of all, the music companies love it
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   because you can't steal, right?
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   So you never own the music.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.680]   It's a better-- from an economic point of view, it's $3 a month
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   for Groove Shark, unlimited.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.680]   So it's economically-- it's much, much cheaper.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   You don't have to use scarce storage on the phone.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.680]   And even if you've got 32 gigs on your phone, which I do,
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.680]   you might say, oh gosh, I wish I had that out, and why I don't.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   Right.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.680]   I like the idea of paying a monthly fee and just kind of having
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   access to the full whatever it is, $5 or $6 million title library
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.680]   that's now out there.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   Everything but prints, apparently.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   Did you see that?
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   I don't know what that was about.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.680]   So Prince is putting out his new CD 2010.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.680]   I think it's this week or next.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.680]   He did this last time.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   You can get it in a newspaper in England.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.680]   I think it's a mirror, right?
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.680]   Jeff in England.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   Thanks.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.680]   Rolling Stone, Germany.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:05.680]   So they're going to like glue it to the front of a page, a CD.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.680]   But he says, but I'm not going to put it on the internet.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.680]   I'm not going to put it on iTunes because they don't give me
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.680]   an advance, which I don't get.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.680]   They won't give me an advance.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   And the internet is a fad.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   And it's like MTV.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.680]   Thanks, one to no one.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.680]   It used to be hip, he says.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.680]   And it's not anymore, but this is my favorite line.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.680]   The internet fills your head with numbers, and that can't be good.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.680]   What?
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.680]   What's his head been filled with?
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.680]   It almost feels like a put on, and yet--
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.680]   I know.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   His whole life starts.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.680]   Yeah, maybe that's it.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   Maybe he just-- I don't know.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.680]   Maybe he's kind of the same Andy Kaufman.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   It's kind of like that because it makes no sense.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   And surely he knows, as we all know, that if you put out the
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   CD for free on a newspaper in three seconds, it's going to be on
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.680]   the internet for free everywhere.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.680]   Yes.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   So you are putting it on the internet, and by not making
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   available anywhere in the US online, your guaranteeing it will be
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.680]   online for free.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.680]   You won't make any money.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.680]   Forget the advance.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.680]   You won't make a dime.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   It's all publicity.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.680]   I think he's brilliant.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.680]   I think--
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:20.680]   No.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.680]   Oh, yeah, I know he is.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   Yeah, he is.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.680]   I think he--
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.680]   Well, then I went and I would say that this is a put on, but
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.680]   then remember, he sued people who put his music on YouTube.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.680]   So he's not that silly.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   I don't know.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.680]   He seems like the kind of guy that would only put out his records on
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.680]   plastic.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   Like, CDs will fill your head with numbers.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   That can't be good, so we're going to go back to vinyl.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.680]   That's what I want you to do, Prince.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.680]   Listen to me.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.680]   I love curmudgeons.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.680]   Yeah, you know, he's--
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.680]   You know, he's--
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   Thank you for watching.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.680]   In my research for the public, this book, my favorite thing is that
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   is the privacy didn't really come up as an issue in American law
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.680]   until 1890.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   Really?
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.680]   The reason was technology.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.680]   That was interesting.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.680]   That camera.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   That was the camera that started this.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.680]   Right, and so I looked at a bunch of really great old New York
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.680]   Times clips and they were called Kodakers and Kodak Fiends.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.680]   No good would come of this.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.680]   You're Kodak Fiend.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.680]   Kodakers were lying in wait for JP Morgan.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   They're just great stuff.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   See, this has always happened, hasn't it?
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.680]   Every step of the way.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.680]   All it takes is a little sense or knowledge of history and you
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.680]   realize this is exactly what it's always been like.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.680]   People have always been uncomfortable with these steps forward in
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.680]   technology.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.680]   Yep.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.680]   Well, we talked about Prince, I guess, if you talk about Prince
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.680]   can Justin Bieber be far behind.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.680]   So what is the story with this YouTube Justin Bieber hack attack,
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.680]   Gina?
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.680]   You know, I'm too old for Justin Bieber.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.680]   Everybody's too old for Justin Bieber.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.680]   I--
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.680]   Oh, come on, you think he's cute.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.680]   He is kind of cute.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.680]   Uh-oh.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.680]   He's kind of cute.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   Well, he's what, 16?
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.680]   What, he's a kid, right?
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   He's not a legal age.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.680]   So I'm not going to say anything.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   Well, I think most of the resentment of Justin Bieber has to do
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.680]   with the fact that you can't get away from him.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.680]   Yes, yes.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.680]   He's on YouTube.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.680]   He's on Twitter.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.680]   He's like a trending topic forever.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.680]   Yeah, he's just-- he's been a sort of fixture of the trending
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.680]   topics.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.680]   So there are a couple of Bieber stories that kind of came into my
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.680]   peripheral vision this week, right?
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.680]   There was something I'm boing-boing that Jenny twitted about
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.680]   about him having a tour, North Korea or something.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.680]   Yeah, this was a hoax that was posted.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.680]   So did Jenny start that?
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.680]   She definitely wrote about it.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.680]   And then the other one was the YouTube.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.680]   So this is the same story.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.680]   Yeah, so I guess it was boing-boing that started,
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.680]   Jenny's started it.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   There was a website saying, where should Justin Bieber go next?
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.680]   Okay.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.680]   And this sounds like the kind of thing, frankly, that
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.680]   was the first one that I would do, 650,000 votes for North
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   Korea.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.680]   Oh, yeah, it was 4chan.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   It was 4chan.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   Yeah, it was 4chan.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   It was 4chan.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.680]   That's the only people who have that kind of cloud.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:32.680]   I mean, boing-boing is great, but 650,000 votes.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   And now the YouTube hacking happened early in July.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.680]   So I think it was a great thing.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.680]   And I think it was a great thing.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.680]   And I think it was a great thing.

[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.680]   And I think it was a great thing.

[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.680]   And three of us should get on.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.680]   We should do something.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.680]   And do something together.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.680]   Yeah. That would be fun.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   We should all brush our teeth.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.680]   I want my video to be of me, Google searching
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.680]   where I can fly in the next seven hours
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.680]   with the products.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   And then getting on.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.680]   And getting on the flights.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.680]   And then pack my bags and go on off the air.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.680]   On the 24th, you have to go somewhere.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   I'll put the bill, Gina.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.680]   I'll pay the ticket.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   I'll just fly somewhere random.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   I'll just go back to the next one.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.680]   I'll just go back to the next one.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.680]   I'll just go back to the next one.

[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.680]   I'll just go back to the next one.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.680]   I'll just go back to the next one.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.680]   I'll just go back to the next one.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.680]   Kelly came in with his allinonetruck.com
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.680]   and he relit the whole studio
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   and put a new lighting rig up and stuff.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   And, um,
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   John Slanino, our studio manager, put his time-lapse camera up there
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.680]   in one day and it's a shot
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   with a shot every minute, I think.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   Sweet. Is that published?
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.680]   We're going to publish it.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.680]   Cool.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.680]   But that would be perfect for that, you know?
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.680]   Because it was like,
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   "Are you in the cottage both weekend days always?"
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.680]   Yeah, I am always here.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.680]   I saw your panoramic shot from behind the microphone
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.680]   and it was fascinating seeing the other side.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.680]   See the whole thing.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:41.680]   I know.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.680]   I'll do that again.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.680]   Actually, I have the one before the change and I should do it before and after.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   Is this why you're band with Walkie today or...?
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   No.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   Actually, it is.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.680]   Oh, actually, you know what?
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.680]   Well, we don't know why.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.680]   We just stopped the podcasts earlier today and we've been having problems for a couple of days.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   And you're right.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.680]   It did it.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   It all started when we rewired and re-lit the studio.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.680]   So it's something to do with that.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:07.680]   But so we pay $700 a month in the studio for a very high quality kind of T1-like thing
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.680]   called Ethernet to the first mile.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.680]   And it's supposed to be rock-solid, super good.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.680]   And we don't know if it's our end or their end or we don't know what's wrong, but we $700.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   So today, all of our Skype is courtesy of Comcast's cable modem.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   And it's better.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   Yeah, it's pretty good.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.680]   Calling Comcast cares.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.680]   I should probably tweet all the negatives.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.680]   I should probably tweet the positive.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.680]   Yeah, you should.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.680]   Give them a little credit.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.680]   We're still having trouble on the stream, which is still on the EFM.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:40.680]   So I think we're going to put everything on Comcast and I'm going to save $700 a month.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.680]   All right.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.680]   I want to talk about a petition that is going on in just a little bit.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.680]   A petition to change Google voice for the better and petition we want to support.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:57.680]   But before I do, I got to tell you, speaking a bandwidth about sling box, do you use a sling box, Gina?
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.680]   It seems like you should be using a sling box.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.680]   I'm very close to purchasing a sling.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.680]   I know they're one of our sponsors, especially.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.680]   I've been thinking about it for quite some time.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.680]   I want to do that East Coast West Coast thing.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.680]   Yeah, that's why I thought you want to do that.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.680]   Yeah, I do.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.680]   We'll send you one.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.680]   Jake Stollon.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.680]   Jake Stollier's.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   He took it to college.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.680]   He's got to use it there.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.680]   So I've got to get a second sling box now.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:18.680]   Yeah, see.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.680]   Everybody has a sling box.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.680]   Sling box is awesome.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.680]   I will send you the sling box, HD, Gina.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.680]   Because that's how you call it.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.680]   So what you do is you get the sling box.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.680]   You get them at Best Buy or sling box.com.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.680]   And so you get the sling box.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.680]   You connect your television setup at home.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.680]   So your DVR goes into it.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.680]   Your DVD can go into it.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.680]   Any antenna, anything you've got, it's got multiple connections.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:41.680]   I wish I had one here.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.680]   I'll bring.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.680]   I have one here except it's connected to my house.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.680]   But I will get another one so I can show you.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.680]   So you connect that and then you connect your ethernet to that.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   So now it's online.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   And what it does is it puts your whole television setup online and they have applications for
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   Android.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   In fact, people tell me that the Android app is the best app of mall.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   Of course, iPhones, iPod touches.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.680]   You have to be on WiFi for that, obviously.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   But it does work on 3G on the iPhone.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   That was a big deal when they got AT&T to agree to that.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   Blackberries.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   So of course, your laptops, Windows, or Mac.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:21.680]   So anywhere you are on these devices, you enter the password and it logs you into your sling
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   box at home.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.680]   You can control the DVR.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   You can play back.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.680]   You can watch what's on your TV.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.680]   So it's like you have access to your TV setup anywhere on the road.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.680]   Quality is really good.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.680]   It depends, of course, on your internet connection.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:39.680]   But you never have to miss stuff that's local in the San Diego market if you're in New York.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.680]   Sports people love it.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:46.680]   In fact, it'd be great and I'm meaning to do this to take it to a ball game and then watch
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.680]   the instant replay of the ball game.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.680]   It'd be awesome.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.880]   You basically, anything that you watch at home, sports news, movies, any other program
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:59.480]   type you can watch on your iPhone, your iPod touch with WiFi, your Blackberry, your laptop,
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.680]   your MacBook, and yes, your Android phones.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.680]   I love it.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.080]   I don't have my Nexus one here.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.480]   Next week, I will show you on the Nexus one.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.680]   You can find an in-store demo at a Best Buy near you.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.680]   Just go to slingbox.com and you'll find one nearby.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.680]   We love slingbox.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.680]   I think you're going to like slingbox a lot.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.680]   It's kind of the geek thing.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   We should get you another one too, Jeff.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.680]   I'll call sling.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.680]   Especially when I'm in Europe.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:25.680]   The weirdest thing is when I stay in a hotel in, let's say, London, I think the cable deal,
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.680]   they must pay the licensing or something.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.680]   You get three or four really crappy channels and then ten Arabic channels and that's it.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.680]   You got to stop going to those hotels favored by the Arab world.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   That's not not not.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:42.280]   No, no, seriously, because I go to a hotel in San Francisco sometimes and it's all Japanese
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.280]   channels.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.680]   What it means is they have a lot of Japanese clientele because they provide the channels
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.280]   that they want to watch.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.080]   Apparently, you're the only American.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.080]   I think I am.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.980]   I only go on expensive accounts.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.680]   I can't afford it.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.280]   He's really no kidding.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.480]   slingbox.com.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.760]   By the way, we should say it again.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:09.000]   If you don't have a Google voice account, go and get one because it's open to the world
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   now.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   Everybody can have one.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   On the US.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Did I say the world?
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   The US.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   I got in big trouble for that.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   You're right.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Just walking out for you.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   You're right.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   You know, a third of our audience is outside the US.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   So a third of you cannot get this.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   That's what the best...
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Oh, sure.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Good talk.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.840]   You should do this show in German because we have a huge German audience.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:36.360]   A lot of Scandinavians, a lot of Brits, Canadians, Australians.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.760]   It's the nature of the internet broadcasting.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.760]   It's not national.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.840]   And that throws everybody, including all of our advertisers for a loop.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:45.840]   And us, right?
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.200]   Because we'll say, "Go out and get Google Voice."
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.640]   No, can't.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.680]   Stop telling me about it.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.400]   I didn't realize what a big fat American I was until I started writing online.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.400]   It's very...
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.200]   It's really good for us to remind us we are not the only ones...
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.200]   We're not the only ones.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.000]   Well, if you live in the US, do get Google Voice because it's really a great...
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   And if you have...
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.920]   In fact, like I said at the beginning of the show, this is the reason you use an Android
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:09.920]   phone.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.960]   It becomes your voicemail on your Android phone.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:13.960]   It's so much better.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.560]   I know people love the Apple visual voicemail.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.560]   I like the...
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.640]   I really prefer it because I can get texts.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   I get the emails.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   I can listen.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.080]   I mean, just better all around.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:28.600]   Anyway, so what is this petition to do something different on Google Voice?
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:34.280]   Well, to make a desktop app because it's become religion in Google, accordingly, to the founders,
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.720]   that they will only do browser apps.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:39.200]   And now you have people saying, "No, it's not good enough.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.840]   Browser's not ready.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.720]   We want a Google Voice desktop app."
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.800]   Well, the problem comes from the fact that they acquired Gizmo and promptly killed the
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   Gizmo app.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   Right.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   And that was a great app.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   It was a SIP phone that you could use.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:57.320]   There are other apps out there, but I thought Gizmo was the best of them all.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.800]   So they already have the app.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   It's almost like...
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.960]   You just release it.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:05.960]   It's really interesting.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.960]   It's really a very...
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.960]   It's pretty hard to stand.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.360]   That their platform is the browser and they want to stick to it.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.440]   But Google has some desktop apps, Picasa.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.440]   Right?
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.680]   I mean, there are some installable Google desktop.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.840]   That's a good point.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.840]   Google Earth.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.280]   Google Earth, Google desktop, Picasa.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.280]   What a smart...
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.280]   Don't kill Google Earth.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.720]   I'd be furious or put...
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.920]   There are some apps that just work better on the desktop.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:36.960]   What happens if you go to a Chromium world and the Chrome browser as operating system?
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.960]   Right.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.800]   They're going to have apps that won't work then.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.680]   So for once they're thinking ahead that way.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.720]   But I think what's really cool here is the opportunity for Google to be the anti-Apple.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.040]   No one would ever think of telling Steve what to do.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.040]   Ever.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.040]   Right.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.120]   Thousands are ganging up to think, "Well, Google might listen to us."
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.120]   I think they should.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.280]   I think they should.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.680]   If there's a demand for it, why not?
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:10.120]   I feel like Google's had been really good about showing that they listened and having
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.040]   this sort of continual conversation with users.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.040]   Right.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:18.400]   Unlike the sort of letter from Steve Jobs on Hi, it seems like Google's been doing especially
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.400]   a good job in the past couple of years of blogging and responding and changing things
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.400]   when they didn't work.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.200]   They had the background images rolled out.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.440]   They pulled them back immediately.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.440]   I mean, you know, they're...
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.440]   Although you can do it now.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.440]   Yeah, you can still do it.
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.240]   But you opt in, right?
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.400]   It looks so much like Bing, but I actually did it.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.400]   Some of the images are really...
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.400]   They're beautiful.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.080]   I kind of like having an image on my Google.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.720]   See, I've got the...
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.400]   I don't know what that's the Cas bar or something.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.920]   I don't know what that is, but it looks so much like Bing.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.360]   Yeah, it does.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.120]   Unlike Bing, though, Bing, it changes every day.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:53.760]   On this, you have to change it by hand, which I think is not good.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:58.400]   I mean, it's pretty and I can remove it.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.000]   And then you click change background image and then they give you some choices, but you
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.520]   could do it from your own photos.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.560]   There's some really pretty images.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:11.720]   I don't see why they wouldn't just have a desktop app and a browser-based Google voice.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.960]   You know, like that.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.800]   You know, all their desktop apps have sort of web counterparts, right?
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.840]   So like Google Earth, Google Maps, Picassas, Picasa Web.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.680]   Even Google desktop kind of integrates web search results with your desktop search results.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:30.120]   I don't see why they shouldn't do both, especially like you said, Leo.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.880]   They have the app, right?
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.480]   They have the Gizmo app.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.480]   Right.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.120]   It'd just be a matter of rebranding it.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.280]   Have you seen this Chrome Fastball game?
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.840]   Did we talk about this last week?
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.840]   We did.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.840]   It was down when we tried it last week.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:44.840]   Is it backup?
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.360]   I hadn't tried it since we...
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.320]   I couldn't try it before.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.320]   This is because they build Flash now.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.880]   Yes, it's up!
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:55.800]   They build Flash now into the browser.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.800]   It comes with Chrome now.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:01.320]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.320]   What's going on?
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.320]   What help?
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.320]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.320]   Is it just doing it?
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.600]   Am I supposed to click on anything?
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.080]   Oh, I see.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.120]   Choose the fastest mode of transportation between point A and point B.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.120]   A straight line?
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.120]   I don't know.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.120]   Huh?
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.120]   A bicycle.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.120]   Biking.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.120]   Five minutes.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.000]   Get there faster.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   A car.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   Four minutes.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Yes, that's it.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   Chrome Fast.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Okay.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.040]   That's kind of a stupid game.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   Okay.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.040]   What's happening?
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.720]   I don't know what the hell's happening.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.560]   Tweet the fastest ball you could think of.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.760]   Cheetah ball.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.760]   Cheetah ball.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   Okay.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.760]   That's the fast ball.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.760]   It's tweeting.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.360]   It's not a ball I recognize.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.360]   Fast ball.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.120]   It's a better scene there.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.120]   Fast ball.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.120]   Fast ball.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.120]   Okay.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.120]   There I'm tweeting it.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:57.120]   That speed depends on you.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.120]   My friend will give you an average speed this time.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.920]   That's an average ball penalty of five tweets.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.560]   I don't even know what's going on.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   Go.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.160]   Oh, geez.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:11.200]   Have you played this yet?
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.320]   I haven't, but now I'm scared.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.800]   It's okay.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:15.800]   Translate text.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   Translate that.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.720]   That looks like it's in, I'm going to say Hungarian.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.520]   Hungarian translated into English translate.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.120]   No, close, but try again with fewer options.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.120]   You get everything right.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.520]   You get a job at Google.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.120]   It's not, it's finished.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.120]   It's finished.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.120]   That's it.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.520]   I think the ball was lost in translation.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.520]   Oh, geez.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.160]   Oh, I slammed it.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:37.160]   It's close.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.160]   I know it's making me crazy.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.920]   It says a ball in motion will stay in motion.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:44.760]   Do you think it's different?
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.760]   It's different every time?
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.400]   It's huge.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.040]   I don't get it.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.240]   I don't get it either.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.560]   It's very postmodern, Jeff.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.800]   Choose an artist.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:56.800]   Selected artist bridge.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:57.800]   What?
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.200]   Help the ball by spelling bridge out of band names.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.200]   Beatles.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   You guys aren't helping me at all.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:13.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.600]   It's got a lot of fun.

[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.600]   It's got a lot of fun.

[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.600]   It's got a lot of fun.

[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.600]   It's got a lot of fun.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.600]   And we win!
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:29.600]   [Laughter]
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.600]   There's three minutes and 25 seconds of your life.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.600]   You'll never get back.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.600]   As they used to say, I didn't have a lot of them.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.600]   Network time wasters.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.600]   My final time, hey, that's pretty good.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:43.600]   I ranked 11,853 out of 39,449 players.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:49.600]   So, they give you the record time in the tour to Twitter's five seconds.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.600]   Map lap six seconds.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.600]   But, see, I think next time I'll do better.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.600]   Next time you'll be way faster because you've got it down now.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.600]   I can't even know what the rules were at first.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   I couldn't figure out what the hell I was doing.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   I'm amazed I finished.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   They need to stay, like, incorporated all these other services,
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.600]   you know, like Twitter and Last of Fam.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.600]   You know, these were their competitors, essentially, and they're promoting them.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.600]   I think that's great.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.600]   Well, my initial concern with Twitter is I thought that I would be tweeting whenever I said.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.600]   It wasn't clear.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.600]   So, it's just a phony Twitter.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.600]   It was fun.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.600]   I liked that.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.600]   All right.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.600]   So, am I going to be the guinea pig and get a droid?
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.600]   I guess I am.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   Droid X.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.600]   A droid X, of course.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.600]   You can land one for now.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.600]   It was nice.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:37.600]   Do you like the ad that says, you've seen the ad that says double antenna,
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.600]   hold it any way you want.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.600]   You got it like that.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.600]   The problem is it doesn't.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   It's not going to have 2.2.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   You revert pre-froyo.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.600]   2.1, I think.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.600]   Although, and this really gets me.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:57.600]   So, I see the article that says, no, we'll definitely be getting 2.2, but they don't say
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.600]   when or, you know, I mean, could be the next year.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.600]   Yeah, a little more information.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:06.600]   What's so hard about it?
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.600]   Go ahead, Leo.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.600]   No, you, I just started the Android book.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.600]   You probably read more of it than I am.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:16.600]   I mean, I assume this is just because they customize different carriers,
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.600]   customize the OS in different ways.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.600]   So, there's like the distribution, but also the customization part of it.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.600]   And I assume it's the customization part of it that it just takes a little time.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.600]   Actually, I'm going to correct myself.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:31.600]   In the ad, it says Android 2.2 and Adobe Flash, which comes with 2.2.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.600]   Late summer over the year update.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.600]   Oh, late summer.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.600]   That's not so bad.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.600]   That's like next month.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:41.600]   We've been talking about froyo for a long time, but it just got open sourced, like,
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.600]   like, a last week, right?
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   So the carriers basically are just sort of getting their hands on it now.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:51.600]   8 megapixel camera, mobile hotspot over Verizon.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:57:01.600]   See, if I keep two phones, I wonder whether I should have Android on Verizon as one of them.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.600]   Yeah, I'm an iPhone.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:03.600]   Do it in Europe.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.600]   I have to have the GSM.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:12.600]   So I'm going to have to keep either the Nexus or the iPhone, because I've got to have GSM.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.600]   I think the Stroyd X looks pretty hot.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.600]   I'll tell you what, I'll be the guinea pig.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:18.600]   July 15th.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:24.600]   Clayton thought it was too big, but I like the size of it.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.600]   Well, did you think the EVO is too big?
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.600]   It's roughly the same size as the EVO, which I did.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:29.600]   Is it?
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   Gina said the perfect thing.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.600]   She said it's -- what did you say?
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.600]   It's almost too big.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   It's almost too big.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.600]   It's right on the edge of the engine.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.600]   It's too big.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.600]   Not quite there.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.600]   Almost too big.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.600]   One more millimeter, and I would have been too big.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.600]   So I like it.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   Well, when you get the -- whatever that dull thing is called, it's five inches.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   That's intriguing.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:51.600]   That's markedly bigger.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:54.600]   Well, somebody said it's like holding a waffle up your head.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.600]   And that's going to be like a tablet.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:57.600]   A waffle.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   Yeah, that's basically going to be a tablet, right?
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:57:59.600]   I mean --
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:02.600]   Yeah, you're going to use Bluetooth and you're not going to hold it to your head, which is
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:03.600]   probably a good idea.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:08.480]   I had my first kind of longing for a tablet this weekend reading Clay Shurky's new book
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:11.840]   in the Kindle app for Android, which is great.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.840]   I love it.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.960]   And in fact, with the Kindle app for Android, if you change the background to black and
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.840]   the type is white, it really is almost as good as the E-ink.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.480]   You know, it's not as hard on your eyes.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.480]   You still get the glare.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.480]   That's good to know.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.480]   The actual Kindle butter.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:29.840]   And on the OLED screens, that would be the most efficient energy used to because black
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.040]   uses no energy.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.400]   I prefer a darker background.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:38.240]   I always change all my text editors to have a dark background and light type anyway.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.600]   But yeah, I really thought to myself, like, "Wow, I want an Android tablet."
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:46.160]   It was the first time that I really felt myself, you know, wanting a tablet.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.080]   I guess Germany is out of the World Cup.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.080]   Jeff, is that bad?
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080]   Yes, they are.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.080]   Spain's in.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.080]   Spain and Netherlands.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.080]   I don't know why I said that.
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:56.320]   I just thought he'd throw that in.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.360]   I don't know why, because I want to play the vuvuzela one more time before we move.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.720]   That's my last chance.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.720]   That is the final.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:11.400]   It said on my final on Sunday.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.680]   Right during my radio show.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.400]   Oh, well.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.800]   What the hell?
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.080]   So the Cisco tablet, the...
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.400]   Okay, how do you pronounce this one?
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:30.640]   The US, C-U-S, C-U-S, if it's James Bond, Money Product, give me my shirt off.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.400]   It doesn't bode well that you're not.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.640]   It's not immediately obviously, how does that hold?
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.640]   C-I-U-S.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:36.640]   I don't know.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.640]   I don't know.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.640]   I'll say C-U-S.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:39.640]   C-U-S.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:40.640]   From Cisco.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.640]   So it's going to be the C-U-S.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:43.800]   Oh, I get it.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.080]   You see us.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:46.920]   So it's not as...
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:47.920]   It's only seven inches.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.840]   So it's not as big as the iPad.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.320]   It will run Android.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.400]   It is pronounced C-Us.
[00:59:55.400 --> 01:00:00.360]   Some of the Cisco apps like WebEx and telepresence will be built in.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:05.720]   But Android developers will be encouraged to develop for it using Cisco's own SDK and
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.720]   API, not good.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.480]   Eight-hour battery life, according to Cisco.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.560]   Firefox integrated.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:15.200]   This is not an Android experience really, is it?
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.640]   And it's running on an Atom.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.640]   Intel Atom processor.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.480]   Wait a second.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.480]   1.14.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.480]   Well...
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.160]   How's Firefox running on it?
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.160]   On an Atom, that's okay.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.160]   Firefox can run on an Atom.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.160]   Why would they do it?
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.160]   I suppose you just ask.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.160]   But why?
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.320]   Why not use Chrome?
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.400]   You got WebKit.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400]   It's built in.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.640]   Well, you know, these corporate clients, they could be...
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.640]   Oh, I have a little...
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.800]   That's what it is.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.800]   You're right, Jeff.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.800]   Yep.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.080]   And it's absolutely what it is.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.080]   So this is really...
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.080]   I think this is a corporate device.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.080]   Well, that's what it is.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.080]   Yep.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.080]   That's the Atari.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.080]   So I think it's more expensive, too.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.080]   It's the higher margin.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:53.800]   It infects docs into a Cisco phone, which is kind of interesting.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.800]   That's cool.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.800]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.800]   That's what...
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.800]   What this is...
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800]   What this is...
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.880]   It shows the strength of the Android strategy because it's licensed and royalty-free.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.600]   So a company like Cisco is encouraged.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.480]   If they're going to develop something like this that is, you know, kind of a purpose-built
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.480]   device.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.360]   It's not a general mass market device.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.680]   It's a purpose-built device.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.400]   But why not use Android?
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.400]   It's free.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.840]   And you get all the benefit and you can say to developers, yeah, you have to use our SDK
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.160]   and API, but it is still Android.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.320]   So you kind of know how to develop for this.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:28.400]   I think this is really the strength of Google strategy here.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.080]   You'd never see iOS on this.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.080]   The license fee...
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.080]   We're gonna be allowed.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   Give me shot.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.080]   You'd be shot.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.080]   That's right.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.080]   You couldn't do it, could you?
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.080]   So there's a...
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.080]   I think we're gonna start...
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.080]   That's the first enough...
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:46.160]   Yeah, I think we're gonna see lots and lots of applications of the ability.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.160]   I saw that Google...
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:54.760]   I didn't put this in the chat room, but Google incorporated Google checkout into Android
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.320]   for some devices.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.320]   So just as the Apple gods are using the iPhone store, imagine if people in retail stores all
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.080]   over can use Android phones and doctors can use Android tablets and so on and so forth.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.200]   There'll be a lot of special use things.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200]   Perfect.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.200]   All right.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:16.560]   We're gonna end with the joke of the week that one of our friend feed posters sent to
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:21.200]   us from zany.com, x-a-y-n-i.com.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:27.200]   It is an iPhone case that solves the problem of how to hold it.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.800]   It's gonna telephone hand set it back.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.640]   I've also seen one a mannequin hand that has an...
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.200]   You put it in the mannequin hand and then you hold it on a rod.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.360]   All right.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.880]   We had a rub it in just a little bit.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.960]   So speaking of Android, there's a really cool Kickstarter project that I want to plug really
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960]   quickly.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.960]   Yes.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.960]   This developer called Danny Pier in Denver, Colorado wants to build an Android app that
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:57.400]   will take photos and also use the GPS capability and he wants to attach an Android device to
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.320]   a weather balloon and send it off and try to get pictures of the Earth.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.600]   There was this Brit back earlier this year, use some duct tape and a camera and a GPS
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.000]   and some weather balloons and got some incredible pictures from the sky.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.680]   So Danny wants to make this project.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.440]   He wants to use an Android device to do this and he wants to build an Android app to do
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440]   this.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.360]   And he's raising $2,000 just to buy weather balloons and devices that he can throw up
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.160]   and see what happens.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:29.960]   And depending on how much you pledge, you can get a photo, a print of the photo that
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.760]   the device takes or you can get the app itself.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:36.880]   And he's trying to raise $1,800 and he's at like $1,000 and he's got four more days left.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:37.880]   Oh boy.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.880]   To raise the money.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:39.880]   So it's on Kickstarter.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.480]   I also linked it on our friend feed.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.640]   I think it's a cool project.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.240]   Those photos that Robert Harrison got earlier in the year were amazing and I would love
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:52.080]   to try this out myself and maybe if Danny raises the money and gets to do it, we will
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.080]   be able to do that.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.080]   You can build it.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.080]   We can build one.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.080]   What's the minimum donation you can make on Kickstarter?
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.080]   Is it a buck?
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.080]   It's five.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.720]   I think that each project sets it but it's $5 for this particular project.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.720]   Fair enough.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.000]   So if you get pledged $5, you get your name credited.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.640]   If you get $10 or more, you get a print.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:13.800]   And if you pledge $50 or more, you actually get a copy of the app so you can do it yourself.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:19.440]   And I think one fifth year more, he'll give you the 8x10 photo.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.400]   He's calling it Asteroid, which is the name of the project, the app, Weatherbloon Recovery
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.600]   Parachute and all the material that you'll need to replicate the flight yourself.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.640]   So it seems like a really cool project and Danny's been, and his friend's been bugging
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.800]   me for a couple weeks to bring it up.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.800]   So I pledged.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.800]   I pledged $50.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.800]   So check it out.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.120]   I'm hoping that he's going to make his goal.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:42.120]   It's time for Gina's tip and I don't know if your top article on Smarter Wear is your
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.120]   tip.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.440]   Oh, you know, it isn't.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.440]   And I probably should have thought about it.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.440]   We should mention this then.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.120]   Yeah, let's talk about it real quick.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.120]   Somebody emailed me.
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:55.280]   You know, we've talked about this Google Apps versus Google accounts disparity for a while.
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.920]   Google accounts get access to a lot of products like voice and Google Reader that Google
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.440]   Apps accounts don't yet.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:06.080]   So when we talked about just last week, Google wants to kind of bring parity where it give
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:11.520]   Google Apps users the access to the same number of products that regular Google accounts get.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.920]   And there's a trusted tester program going on right now.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:18.360]   I'm not a part of it, but a listener is and emailed me about it.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.640]   And so basically Google Apps accounts are going to get access to all those other products,
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.000]   which is awesome, like voice and reader.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   Actually, yeah, I think voice is on apps now, but reader and analytics and all that stuff.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.960]   And you're going to be able to, if you have a Google account and a Google Apps account,
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.720]   which are tied to the same email address, they're going to resolve the conflict by adding a
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.760]   plus personal Google account.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.760]   This is brilliant Google account.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.760]   Yeah, it's your Google address.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.760]   It's brilliant.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:46.760]   It's a little confusing.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.320]   I posted this on my blog and I got a lot of people in the comments saying, wait, what
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.320]   now?
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.520]   What happens to what account?
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.760]   So okay, I am currently, I am Laporte at gmail.com.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.200]   That's my personal account.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:02.200]   And let's say we have Leo at twit.com as a Google Apps account.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.840]   So it will going forward be Leo plus personal at twit.com.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.400]   Well, with Google accounts, you can associate any email address you want, right?
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.680]   So your Gmail address, that won't be a conflict, right?
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.480]   Because your Google Apps account is at some other domain.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.720]   The Gmail address is the problem.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:24.240]   But if you associated like Leo at twit.com with your Google account, and you also had
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.600]   a Google Apps account, which was Leo at twit.com, then there'd be a conflict, right?
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.840]   Then you'd have two Google accounts with the same address.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:35.560]   And to resolve that conflict, they're going to add the plus personal to the Google account.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.480]   To the Google account, not the apps account.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:42.400]   So the Google account comes becomes Leo plus personal at twit.com.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.960]   And the Google accounts is Leo at twit.com.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.960]   Right.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.960]   Got it.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.760]   So the bad news is you can't like, there's no one click merge.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.280]   You can't say, these are both my accounts.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.240]   Now just merge all my data.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:56.120]   There was no talk of that and any of the help pages.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:00.560]   But you know, looking through all these different products, I mean, it's, it's, you could export,
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.640]   you know, and pretty much all of them except Google voice.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.640]   Google voice is the only one.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.640]   You know, Google voice, you have a phone number, obviously, associated with the account.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.360]   So how do you port that phone number over?
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.400]   Right now you can submit a request to port a Google voice number from one Google account
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.400]   to another.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400]   There's a spreadsheet.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.440]   There's a request spreadsheet.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:18.600]   You can't transfer it to a Google Apps account, but I'm hoping that they're going to offer
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.160]   that when this happens.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.280]   So there's going to be a little data, you know, import, export action when this does
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.280]   happen.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.160]   If you want to move completely to Google Apps, which I'm definitely going to do because
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.360]   I'm, I'm, I'm tired of juggling, you know, both accounts.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.880]   Yeah, we're about, we're about to, to corporately, we've been using the free Google Apps and
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:38.680]   we're about to move to Google, the full Google Apps.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.000]   We're using Google Docs.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.320]   We're going to move to Google Apps, I think, for all of Twitch.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.360]   It just seems like a sensible way to go.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:49.920]   Especially now that I can, I can still log in with my, or I soon will be able to log
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.720]   in with my personal account.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.880]   Jynon, confused, but I'll wait till it happens.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.960]   It's a little confusing, we'll talk about it when, when we'll talk about it when it
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:07:59.960]   rolls out.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:00.960]   It is a little confusing.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:01.960]   Either whiteboard here.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.960]   Well, there is on her website.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.040]   If you, if you look at her website, a multicolored whiteboard.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.040]   So red, red, yellow and green.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.040]   It's confusing.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:16.440]   The, the upshot is you will be able to have just a Google Apps account and do everything,
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.200]   which is kind of the goal.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:24.000]   You can continue to use your personal Gmail account by adding plus personal to your apps
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   account.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   Oh, never mind.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.840]   Jynon, what's your tip of the week?
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.360]   I, I just confused myself.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.360]   It's a little confusing.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.280]   We, we, we will explain when it, when it comes out of trusted.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.280]   If you hear me.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.280]   Uh oh, uh oh.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.280]   Uh oh.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.280]   Jeff disappeared.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.280]   We lost Jeff from the face of the earth.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.360]   I won't call him back while you give us your tip of the week and then we'll get his
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.360]   name.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.360]   All right.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.360]   I will.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.240]   So this is one folks who have Froyo and who also use Chrome can use this new cool new
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.880]   app called Chrome to phone.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.520]   Uh it's a Chrome extension and a firefight.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.640]   You install it and, uh oh Leo, I hope I didn't steal your tool.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.640]   Nope.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.640]   Okay.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.640]   Good.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.240]   When you, when you install Chrome to phone on your uh Chrome browser or your Firefox browser,
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:15.800]   you get a little button in the toolbar and you hit the button and say send a phone.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:20.040]   It will send all your open tabs to your uh Android.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.200]   It's just Froyo 2.2 and oh and also there's a phone component.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:28.280]   So you have to install the Chrome to phone um Android application as well and register
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.280]   your device, right?
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.720]   So you're just telling, you're, you're telling Google this is my phone.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:32.720]   This is my Chrome browser.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.920]   It links those two.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.720]   And so you know if you're, if you're packing up your browser for the, for the night and
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.040]   going home and you, and you got a few open tabs you didn't get a chance to look at.
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.640]   You hit the button, sends those tabs to your phone and when you get home, uh, or when you're
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.760]   on the train, you can, you'll, you'll get all those tabs on your phone.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.760]   It's pretty neat.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:51.360]   You get a little notification that says Chrome sent your tabs, you know, on your phone.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.200]   So, so you need the Chrome extension on your Chrome, which is a CRX file.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.200]   Right.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.840]   And then you download the APK file on your phone.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.840]   On your phone.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.760]   And then you can right click or click on the extension.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.760]   Right.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.960]   And you click on the extension, you sign in your Google account and on your phone you
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.440]   tap the application to register your device and those are, those are one time deals.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:17.480]   And then, and then once you do that you can hit that send my tabs to phone and it works
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.480]   with Firefox do there's a Firefox extension.
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.480]   I love it.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.480]   I did it on my phone.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.480]   I don't remember right away.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.920]   I think when I got Froyo on there, really that's, that's a Froyo feature.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.920]   It's Froyo.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:30.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.920]   It's Froyo specific.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.720]   Well, not so cool for droid users, but, but, but cool nonetheless.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.720]   Oh, that's a good point.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.720]   See, this is another reason to stay.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.960]   So you get this little button on your, on your Chrome and you just click on it.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.960]   Whoops.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:44.960]   Whoa.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:45.960]   There it is.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:46.960]   And it'll send those tabs.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:47.960]   I'm gonna log into my account.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:48.960]   Cool.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.040]   We can't get Jeff back, but I know what his number is.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:56.240]   I wonder if I should keep trying or, I think that was, you know, it sounded like he was
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:02.840]   saying, if you lose me, yeah, it did sound like that a little bit.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.760]   Well he gave us a number in his, in our friend feed account.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.640]   So I'll just, I'll deliver his number for us and we'll get Jeff back his number of the
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:16.200]   week negative five point three billion dollars.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:27.120]   And this is the stock plunge over the last year, 30% loss, which means if you're Larry
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.440]   Page, you lost five point three billion.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.800]   If you're Sergei Bryn, you lost five point two billion.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.720]   If you're extmute, you lost one point seven billion in the value of the, of the shares
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.720]   you hold.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.720]   Peanuts.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720]   Peanuts.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.720]   It's nothing but 50.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.720]   Peanuts for breakfast.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:43.720]   Why, why?
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:48.760]   And I wish Jeff were here because I'm curious why you think that Google stock over the last
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.680]   seven months has plunged 30%.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.240]   Seems like Google should be stronger and bigger and better never.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.800]   You would think so.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:05.520]   It's fallen for 13 consecutive trading sessions at rallied on Wednesday.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.120]   The stock had plunged so much erasing boy.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.120]   That's just amazing.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.640]   That's a lot of money.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:17.800]   My tip of the week is something that has been around for a while, but has recently been upgraded.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:24.080]   It is Google's mobile YouTube site, which is m.youtube.com.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:30.240]   Now, of course, if you're on an iPhone, this isn't going to be any good at all because
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:33.160]   the iPhone folks don't have flash.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:39.040]   But this is, this works nicely on an excess one where we do have flash and it's designed
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040]   for any phone.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.040]   Maybe it does work on an iPhone.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.040]   They're showing it with an iPhone.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.280]   So you enter M, I guess it's smart enough to say, Oh, it's an iPhone.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.680]   I'll send you H.264.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.160]   Look at that.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.120]   So I take it back.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.440]   M m.youtube.com.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.320]   They now have high quality.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:59.600]   It plays back in quick time and all the features.
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:00.600]   Very nice.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.960]   Of YouTube improved and a lot more videos in there as well.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.960]   Of course, you have an i- YouTube application on Android and iPhone.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.640]   But I don't, I really, do you ever use that?
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.640]   I rarely use that.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.360]   You know, only when it launches when I've hit a video.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.360]   Right.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.080]   Otherwise, but I don't, I generally don't launch it stand alone.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.720]   I should make it to possible not to worry about it.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.000]   Jeff Jarvis is the blogger at buzzmachine.com.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.320]   He's also the author of What Would Google Do?
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.320]   Which is available everywhere and he's working on his new one, Public Parts, which will be
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.640]   out soon.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.720]   He also is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.640]   And I hope nothing bad happened to him.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:47.200]   His last words, if you can't hear me.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.560]   Gina Travani, we shouldn't mock him.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:55.560]   Gina Travani, she's the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:59.960]   So blogs at a must-readblock@smartawear.org.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:03.160]   And Think Tank is her project that she's working on.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.600]   It's been part of the federal government.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.640]   It plans to get feedback from real people.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.040]   It's a Twitter analyzer.
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.880]   Is that going to be public at some point?
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:14.880]   What's the?
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.880]   And Facebook.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.880]   It's a self-hosted tool, right?
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.320]   Kind of like WordPress is.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:27.840]   We're hoping, like we're pressed at some point, kind of make a way down the road, make a hosted
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.000]   version available.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.760]   But if you're a nerd, you can download the code and install it on your server.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.760]   And the installer is on its way.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:38.560]   The installer is three-step installers looking really good.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.560]   I'm going to merge it into the main code-based students.
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.960]   It's going to be easy to install.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:43.960]   It worked for me.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.440]   Oh, no, but I'm running your instance.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.240]   That's why it worked so well for me.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.840]   It's nice if you can run it off Gina's server.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:53.240]   But only some of us get that privilege.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.240]   Yeah, I know.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.920]   You got good test data, Leo, you know.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.840]   Yeah, yeah, you wanted my tweets.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:14:59.840]   What can I say?
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.680]   She loves me for my tweets.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.680]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:03.680]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.680]   Thank you all for watching.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.080]   We do this show every Wednesday, 1 p.m.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.360]   Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.920]   We hope next week to have Rick Clow, who's the product manager for Google Profiles on
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.080]   the show.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.960]   So tune in for that 1 p.m. Pacific next Wednesday.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.560]   And of course, you can subscribe if you missed the show live.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.120]   You can always watch it on YouTube.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.920]   Our channel is youtube.com/twit.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:28.600]   It'll work, by the way, on the mobile YouTube, I believe.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.480]   You can also get it from iTunes, the Zoom marketplace.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.360]   Everywhere finer podcasts are available in both audio and video.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.840]   Or just go to twit.tv/twig.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:38.840]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.840]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:50.840]   [MUSIC]
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.620]   (music fades)
