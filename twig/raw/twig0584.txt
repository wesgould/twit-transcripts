[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   It's time for Twig this week at Google's Stacey Higgins Bathams here, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.200]   And to prove it, there's a lot to talk about the most viewed video on YouTube of all time.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.200]   It's so annoying.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.400]   We'll talk about California's new privacy proposition.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.400]   It passed last night.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.200]   What does it mean for companies all over the world?
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.200]   And is the Pixel 5 the best camera ever made?
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.400]   And prove it way in on that and more next on Twig.

[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.920]   Last week, and go look at this beautiful panel assembled, even though they got no sleep last
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   night.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.120]   This is this week in Google, the show where you cover the latest news from the Google
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.840]   verse, the Facebook verse, the Twitter verse, all the verses.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.200]   Aunt Pruitt is here, hands on photography, hands on wellness, hands on the hard body.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.960]   No.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.880]   That's what they call those contests where you get a bunch of people in a ball.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   It's a great documentary.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.880]   Yeah, it is.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   It's on hard body.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   But no, we're not going to go there.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.000]   No, no, they get people on the mall and they all have their hands on the truck.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.520]   And the last man standing wins the truck.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   Or woman.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   Never seen.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520]   Or woman.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.600]   Now I have one more thing to look up on Netflix and stuff.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   It's very much.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.840]   It's such a great documentary.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.040]   It's kind of like what they used to do in the depression with a dance contest, the dance
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   marathons.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.040]   It's like suffer for a truck.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.560]   It's Stacy Higginbotham of StacyOnIOT.com.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.400]   She's two cookies in.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   Two cookies.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.160]   She may be a little intoxicated on the show today.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.000]   It was either cookies or alcohol and it's too early.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.400]   Go with the cookies, baby.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.800]   That sounds good, man.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.320]   I could use some right now myself.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.680]   I was going to make snickerdoodles last night.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   Instead I just, we just got like three large pizzas.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.360]   And that is Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   He's exhausted.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.360]   You didn't stay up.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.360]   Really?
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   No, I stayed up.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.840]   I realized about 10 o'clock my time, 10.45 my time.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   The other was going to happen.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.920]   But then I woke up at one as your Lisa did and panicked and couldn't get back to sleep.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.920]   But then probably did.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.440]   Yeah, I was sleeping soundly.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.640]   She even goes, "We lost."
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.840]   I said literally, I think I said, "I feel bad.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840]   Shut up."
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.840]   I'm sleeping here.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.360]   It's like a baby.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.160]   I got like six hours last night.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   That's great.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.080]   For Ant, that's a lot of sleep.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.080]   Wow.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.080]   Good for you.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.080]   Wow.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.080]   Good for you.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.680]   Ant, you actually, you posted this in our company Slack.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.280]   And I thought it was quite the story.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.760]   It's all about ring.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   Ooh.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.680]   The ring video for Bells.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.480]   They're going to pilot a program in Jackson, Mississippi with a local police to live stream
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.160]   on Amazon's ring cameras.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.440]   Basically, obviously as a ring owner, you'd have to opt in.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:54.480]   But it's really an interesting problem because suddenly you've put live CCTV cameras throughout
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.480]   the neighborhood.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.640]   It's not all about the people that actually own ring though.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.600]   It's the people across the street that doesn't have a ring.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.520]   Here's what the Electronic Frontier Foundation says.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.320]   This serves two police purposes.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.160]   It allows police departments to avoid the cost of buying surveillance equipment and puts
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.200]   that burden on to consumers by convincing them they need cameras to keep their properties
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   safe.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.240]   Second, it evades the natural reaction of fear and distrust.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.200]   Many people would have if they learned police were putting up dozens of cameras on their
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.320]   block, one for every house.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.520]   But of course, it captures footage from your front door of you coming and going from your
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   house.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.960]   Your neighbor's taking out the trash dog walkers, delivery people.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.760]   And that could be live streamed into monitors scrutinized around the clock by the authorities.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.240]   Even if you don't want- Or by a stalker.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.080]   Or by, I mean, so yes, access to something like that is really problematic.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.160]   Even though, and we have a history of case law that talks about if your garbage is at
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.440]   your curb, it is publicly available.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.120]   People can route through it and grab stuff out of it.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.280]   So it really, I mean, walking down the street is a public activity, but is sitting on your
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.480]   front porch?
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480]   Yes.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.240]   The alleyway behind your house less so.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:25.080]   So we, you know, there are cameras in downtown cities all over the country put up by the police.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.280]   But they're crap cameras.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.440]   Those things are absolutely crap.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.440]   And I don't see-
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.720]   So it's okay because of video's terrible.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.360]   I'm saying the first hand because I had an incident a couple of years ago back in North
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.720]   Carolina where someone ran into my car.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.480]   And we needed some sort of evidence to figure this thing out.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.280]   Well, no, someone caused another person to run into my car.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.680]   It was sort of a chain reaction.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.320]   And of course, they just hauled ass out of the parking lot and went on about to a day.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.320]   Oh, great.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.320]   And you go and look at the camera.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.440]   You can see the camera right there, 40 feet away from you up in the air.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.720]   But the resolution was crap testing.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.840]   Couldn't see anything.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.840]   Okay.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.920]   That's an interesting, uh, um, defense.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.720]   I guess they're okay because they're crappy.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.400]   There is a somewhat of a mental deterrent.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.960]   Just because you see the camera up there, there's things are so bad on resolution, they
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.720]   would just carry on with their business.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.720]   They don't have to be.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.720]   There's more clearly.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.400]   I mean, they can be high death.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.560]   The ring cameras aren't awesome from far away.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.520]   I mean, no, because they're very wide angle because they're designed for your front right,
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.520]   right, your front stoop.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.520]   Right.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   So they're super wise.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.160]   Well, now is it only the doorbells or will they also cause ring also makes like, uh, IP
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.720]   cameras for outside your house?
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.640]   It's ring cameras.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.640]   It's ever.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.640]   Okay.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.120]   So it is, it's the cameras, not just not just the doorbells.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.400]   So the cameras are much better quality and they are not quite so wide.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.360]   Um, I.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:06.160]   This is really a great philosophically, a great subject because yeah, you're, you're right.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.640]   I mean, the police cameras downtown are there as a deterrent.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.920]   Certainly the camera in a 711 is there as a deterrent as much as anything.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.000]   Well, we're capturing what you do.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.920]   Uh, they're not on suburban streets or, you know, um, it helps police.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.920]   Y'all.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.920]   Y'all.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.920]   If you're looking at the zdnet story, is that what we're getting?
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.520]   I'm trying to get to your foundation.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   Okay.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.040]   But wait, the story says the zdnet story about this program that we're talking about actually
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.520]   adds a clarification that Amazon's ring product was cited as an example option.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.160]   And ring says this is not a ring program and ring is not working with any of the companies
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.680]   or the city in connection with this program.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:55.440]   Yeah, it's interesting because Japs Jackson, Mississippi actually banned face recognition.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.880]   So it's not, you know, I mean, but that doesn't mean they can't pull.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.160]   I mean, you may not digitally scan all the faces in these things, but you can just have
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.320]   someone look at it.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.000]   The original same time, Jackson is still facing, what was it?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.280]   Like a hundred deaths this year, homicides or something like that in that particular area
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.200]   and they're trying to figure out a way to crack down.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.080]   So I get the premise, but yeah, I don't know.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.040]   Still a little half and a half on this.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.280]   So what, what's your, what's your final view about this?
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.280]   Good bet.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:34.640]   I get trying to lock down and help keep the citizens safe and have some, some way of catching
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.360]   the wrong doors because you have an eye out there that can witness them and find them.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.560]   I get that, but at the same time, the neighbors across the street, this just wanting to sit
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.560]   on the porch and have a whiskey and just hang out.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.840]   They're being watched too and didn't really ask to be watched.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.720]   But isn't this, isn't this properly, I'm going to play Stacy right now.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.920]   This is, we should have a discussion with our neighbors, right?
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.320]   Uh, basically if you're, if you're Gladys Kravitz, is that a reference you get it all?
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.320]   Yes, I got it.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.560]   I'm the only one on this panel besides you remembers Gladys Kravitz.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.200]   Is that any Kravitz's mom?
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.200]   In bewitched.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.200]   In bewitched.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.200]   Remember the nosy neighbor in bewitched.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   In bewitched?
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.200]   No.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.080]   Did you ever seem to be wished?
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.560]   I've seen bewitched but didn't remember the name.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.560]   But you remember, but okay.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.320]   So if you've seen bewitched, well, it was certainly a part of a lot of episodes was
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.320]   this nosy neighbor because she was always snooping around and, and Samantha was always
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.280]   worried she'd, she'd caught into the fact that she was a witch.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.280]   That was, that was, I'm sorry.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.280]   Stick.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.280]   That was the stick.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.440]   So anyway, now everybody's Gladys Kravitz, right?
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.480]   Everybody has this.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:53.000]   But if you do it and your neighbors say, you know, I really wish you wouldn't do that.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Or thanks for doing that.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.080]   I'm glad you caught the criminal coming to take away my lawn sign.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.400]   You know, I don't know, but that's at some point is a negotiation.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.200]   You're free to shoot from your house, whatever you can see.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.200]   There's no law.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:13.160]   There's actually, there are actually efforts and I'm trying to remember where you actually
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.200]   have to, with cameras on your property, you have to make sure they only look at your property
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   lines and there actually have been some cases on this.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.200]   That makes sense.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.320]   In fact, I would expect, would that be true of the street or of your next door neighbor?
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.840]   This is for your next door neighbor.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.200]   So like, yeah, right, right.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.720]   You can't shoot your neighbor's window.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.440]   Well, or their backyard is, I think this case was around, I think, backyard and forgive
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.320]   me for not remembering the actual case, I can try to look it up.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.120]   Dare you not remember?
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:52.720]   But I mean, first of all, I think, you know, and I, and I've talked about this, this kind
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.600]   of plays to that idea of consent.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.760]   One, you know, when I put doorbell cameras or any cameras outside, I make sure I've got
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.200]   a sticker saying, hey, there's a camera here, be aware.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.880]   Two, I do try to make sure it doesn't catch my neighbors.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.160]   But I do that just because I'm trying to be nice.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.240]   And I do catch my neighbors, or I did not now, but my old house, you know, there's a walking
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:20.040]   path that went right by my backyard, which is where we had our camera facing.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.320]   And, you know, I could see parents and their kids walk by, dogs pooping in the lawn.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   I mean, just all kinds of things.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:33.400]   Does it make it better if, and it is the case here, the police only access the video
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.720]   after crime has been committed?
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:44.280]   I would, you know, what would make it better is if it died, if it went away after 24 hours,
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.280]   if it were constant.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.280]   Or there's some limit to the amount of time that they could access it.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.920]   I mean, you know, 24 hours is pretty quick.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.280]   I would say 24 hours.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:59.400]   What if I get murdered in my house and you don't discover the body for a few days or
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.720]   a week, you would like, still like to see who came and went, right?
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   All right.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.720]   You can have it for.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.680]   Although if I get murdered in my house, I just want you to know it'll almost certainly
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.440]   be my wife.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.280]   For telling her to shut off.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.240]   We made up of a labor.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.240]   That's beautiful.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.800]   And she's got a very credible excuse.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.280]   He had it coming.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.040]   He was an a-hole.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.520]   Never mind.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.520]   Forget it.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.520]   Sorry.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.520]   You're free to go.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.920]   He just wouldn't stop talking.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:40.800]   So that is an important qualification.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.480]   I'm actually looking at the original story from the Jackson Free Press.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:52.040]   It is not a program from Ring, but Ring doorbells will be used part of the original Ring program,
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.960]   right, which is to give police access to this.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.480]   The City Council signed off on entering the pilot program and it's Tuesday meeting.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.240]   The equipment needed to allow the center access to the cameras is being provided by two corporations,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.080]   Pylium and Fusis.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.480]   Terrible names.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.480]   And they in fact can use Ring cameras.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.520]   The Jackson Free Press story had a actually picture of a Ring video doorbell right in the
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.000]   right in the front of the story.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   But it is a thing.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   I Ring loves these things.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Yeah, poor Ring.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   But Ring is really somewhat culpable because that's part of the Ring thing is that you can
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.480]   submit, you can have your video submitted to the police.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.280]   So is this anybody?
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.600]   I was going to say whenever anyone asks for my advice on their doorbell cameras, I actually
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.920]   tell them, I'm like, hey, here are the issues I have with Ring and that will make you complicit
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.080]   with certain things.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.440]   Some people think that's a feature.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.880]   Some people don't care and other people are like, oh, God, no.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:01.440]   So I think the key is to understand what it could be used for if you're purchasing it.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:09.240]   Is it fair to say that really comes down to your whether you trust law enforcement in
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.120]   your area, right?
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:17.360]   If we trust them, if they're trusted helpers to protect our safety, trust public safety
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.360]   officers, we want them to have this tool because we trust that they won't misuse it.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:30.480]   And so some of this complaint comes from the fact that trust in local law enforcement
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.240]   is diminished.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.040]   Like facial recognition, like data, like all street cams, like all kinds of things.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.840]   And how you approach this really is going to depend on whether you feel that they're
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.080]   trustworthy or not, right?
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.760]   If I, you know, I think our Petaluma police are great.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.600]   I don't think I think it'd be great to give them this tool and I trust them not to misuse
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   it.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.400]   On the other hand, I'm fat and rich and white.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.480]   So maybe I'm the wrong person to ask, you know?
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:05.960]   I think, yeah, whoever has trust in, I mean, if you're, if you're on top, you're likely
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.960]   to trust people.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.800]   Because yeah, because they're there to protect me.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   God damn it.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   That's their job.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   I am the power structure they were created to protect.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.560]   Please don't forget the other problem here is that ring is making.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.160]   In the US, I don't think in other markets, but in the US, of course, is making a market
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:32.800]   out of paranoia and paranoia can have racial undertones to be saying, you know, I have mixed
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.800]   feelings about this.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.800]   Because I did issue.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.280]   I did not want to have, I thought, I'm not going to have cameras around the house.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   All that does.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.280]   I watched my brother-in-law.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.200]   We went to on a trip with him and he was like, his phone was at all the time seeing like
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.760]   others, somebody in the back here, others, there's motion.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.960]   He was like, it makes you paranoid.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.520]   And so I said, I'll never have that.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.760]   Then I got a ring doorbell more because I wanted to look at that and review it than it
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.920]   was because I felt any need.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.600]   And suddenly I got kind of like kind of dug the notion that I can see when it back.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.400]   And then by the time I'm done, I've got cameras all around the house.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.040]   The outside, the ring of the house.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:13.520]   And you know, my neighbor, I have a neighbor up the hill who has a bad tendency to come
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.080]   on to our property and kill our trees.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.720]   I pointed a camera at him.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:22.360]   I mean, suddenly it does, it makes you that way.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.200]   He kills to your...
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   What?
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.720]   This is a long and taudre story.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.360]   I'm not sure I want it.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   Okay.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.440]   I've been like, that's like just out there.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.160]   So we live, there's a hill behind us.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.280]   Pretty high hill.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.880]   And he came over the other day and said, no, I bought 10 feet into your property.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.320]   I bought that land.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.880]   No, you didn't.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.600]   Do we have to survey it and build a wall?
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   So he routinely...
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   Yes.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.120]   He routinely comes down because the trees on our property, apparently he doesn't blocks
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.120]   his view or something.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.120]   I don't know.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.160]   It blocks his view of our hot tub mostly.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.160]   So...
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.160]   Who would want that?
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.160]   You would...
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.520]   Yeah, I don't know why I would want to see that.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.040]   Maybe you should explain that to him.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.360]   But it's a protective...
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.240]   Last year we had a tree guy come out and our barists come out and do stuff and he said,
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.600]   you know, these trees have all been murdered.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   We said, what?
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.080]   Yeah, they stripped the bark on these trees and killed them.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.080]   Oh, wow.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.720]   And we knew exactly who it was because he had previously come down and said, let me cut
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.800]   those.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.680]   So we know he's sneaking on our property and killing our trees.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   There you go.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.680]   There's the story.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.800]   So I have a camera pointed at him.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.680]   I think with some justice, if I could get a shotgun pointed at him, I might even do that.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   No.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.680]   No, I wouldn't do that.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   No.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.680]   But...
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   I built the book boys.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.680]   He's kind of a jerk.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.920]   You know, I mean, he comes down and yells at...
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.120]   He yelled at Lisa saying, no, I own that property.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.920]   I can cut that.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.920]   So yeah, they...
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:54.000]   But again, that was a legitimate use cases that people want to have these cameras for
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   all the personal...
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Personal property security.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.320]   If you get packages stolen off your porch, having a ring is not a...
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.600]   You know, you understand why somebody would want that, right?
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.280]   And then you're able to present that information to law enforcement for investigation.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.880]   Yeah, it makes total sense.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   But live streaming...
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.880]   I had always known...
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.880]   All day long.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.880]   I don't...
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.880]   It's not always long.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:17.880]   All day long.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.880]   I don't...
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.880]   I don't...
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   It's not...
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.880]   It's not...
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.880]   You know, we haven't come to the answer to this.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.880]   It does come down to do.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.400]   Do I trust law enforcement to do the right thing with this information?
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:32.680]   Because if you do, then you want them to have information to solve crimes, right?
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.360]   And then what's the additional cost if this were to be put into place from a taxation
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   standpoint?
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.840]   I realize I've been...
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.760]   You must think I have horrible neighbors because I told the story about the other neighbor
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.720]   who stole our cat.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   And now...
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.720]   Yes.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.720]   It is well-dined.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.840]   Would have watched the shows.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.840]   I do have...
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.520]   Some of the neighbors are great.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.920]   Wow.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.120]   Life in suburbia is just marvelous these days.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.720]   I live in suburbia.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.240]   No, you live in ex-urbia.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.440]   You're on an island.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   That's not suburbia.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.080]   It feels very suburban.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.320]   You're in the country.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.640]   They would like you to think that, but it's not true.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.640]   All right.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.680]   All right.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.680]   So ring cameras.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.800]   We decided it depends on if you trust...
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   Sorry.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   I don't know if...
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.440]   You're just saying consumer IoT devices to live stream...
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.440]   Bad idea.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440]   ...to the police.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.800]   I'm going with...
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   It's uncomfortable.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   I don't like it.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   Uh-huh.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   Yup.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   Actually, I agree.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   Yup.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.440]   You know what else is uncomfortable?
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.720]   This is now the most viewed video on YouTube.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   Which is...
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   Oh, no.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.720]   Not that.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.720]   Really?
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   I'm going to turn on my sound.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.720]   What is it?
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   I'm going to turn on my sound.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   The one time we forget to check the sound.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.200]   So I'm in Dubai.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.480]   And we are standing outside the world's tallest building.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.120]   The birds should do by.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.040]   And they have a fountain show, a water fountain show.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.520]   And we were standing there waiting for the...
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.520]   Why are you like in Vegas?
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.520]   Like Belagia.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.120]   Yeah, like the Belagia.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.480]   And we're standing outside there waiting for it.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.480]   You know, and in Belagia they play like Sinatra or Elvis.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.480]   They...
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.760]   You know, they play rock and roll.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.720]   This is what they played in Dubai.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:39.920]   The most...
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:46.000]   Now the most viewed video on YouTube.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.720]   What's that?
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.680]   What's that?
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.080]   Why is my phone ringing?
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:58.320]   What the hell is that?
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   Someone's calling you?
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.680]   I don't know what that is.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   But you know what?
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.480]   That was a nice break to keep us from hearing that little ear word.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.360]   Seven billion views.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.400]   And you thought...
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.400]   What was that Korean K-pop song?
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.480]   Oh, Gangnam Style?
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.480]   Gangnam Style.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.480]   You thought...
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.480]   Yeah, I'm talking about Baby Shark.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.320]   Yeah, it's probably better that we don't play it.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.320]   No.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.320]   Unbelievable.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:37.000]   Somebody called me during Baby Shark.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   The most...
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.400]   You know why it's most played?
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.560]   Because three-year-olds don't know any better.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.560]   So children...
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.560]   Yeah, they keep...
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.560]   And they play it like 200 times.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.280]   They're like, "Play Baby Shark."
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.280]   Baby Shark.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.280]   Maybe Shark.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.280]   Maybe Shark.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.280]   More Baby Shark.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.280]   I don't want Baby Shark.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.840]   Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.040]   Two years ago we went with that with Hamilton.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.320]   But you know, that was just one of us and it was a doing.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.360]   You'll be back.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.680]   Our show today brought to you by Melissa.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.840]   You ever have...
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.400]   This is the worst experience in the world.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.240]   You've got a nice bowl of Captain Crunch.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.000]   Gonna have breakfast.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.800]   Maybe it's a snack, late night snack.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.360]   And you go in the refrigerator, you don't have your glasses on, you take a little milk
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:29.520]   out and you pour it out and you realize, "Oh my God, the milk is sour!"
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:36.640]   Like milk, 30% of customer data goes bad each year.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.800]   Our advertiser, our supporter, our sponsor, our best friends, Melissa.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.240]   Make sure your data is accurate and current so that you're always reaching the right
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   customers.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.040]   They started doing this 35 years ago and they are so good.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.240]   If you keep a customer list, maybe you have a customer support line, you have mailing
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.320]   lists, you want to make sure that that record is accurate.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.360]   You're not sending stuff to the wrong people, that you're not bothering the wrong people,
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.160]   sending duplicates.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.840]   Melissa verifies your emails, addresses, phone numbers, and names in real time.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.440]   They have an API that lets you do that as you enter it, incorrect data entered by customers
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.400]   or by your customer service reps can cost you a lot of money.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.280]   Duplicated records, oh, that's the worst.

[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.320]   right data.

[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.080]   records.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   You always want to have the right information.

[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:48.280]   demographic information to your existing records, property and mortgage data, marital status,
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.360]   social media handles.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.520]   They fill in the gaps by adding emails even if you didn't have that originally or phone
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.160]   numbers.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.600]   Identifying current customers easily allows you to find new prospective customers because

[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.800]   All right, let's talk about Google.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.080]   They're quarterly results throughout.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.720]   Actually, this was a wild week last week.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.720]   Everybody's came out all at once.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.560]   We spent a lot of Twitter analyzing that.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.440]   It was a pandemic quarter.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.240]   It didn't seem to hurt any of the tech companies that we cover.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:27:01.560]   Total revenues of $46.2 billion for Google led by an increase in advertiser spend in both
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.800]   search and YouTube.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.960]   Now, if you look at it, if you break it down and they didn't break it down, too detailed.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:16.320]   But if you look at Google Cloud, Google Cloud of that $46 billion in revenue was $3.4 billion.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.880]   I mean, it's not other bets, basically losses, right?
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.880]   They always do.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.880]   So this just--
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.880]   Advances generally.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.000]   Yeah, it just reinforces Google makes its money in search and ads.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.480]   How much they charge me for my G Suite?
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.760]   $12 per person, per seat, per month.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.720]   What does that service-- I didn't come add up to nothing, right?
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.200]   Do they break that up?
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.880]   Well, is that cloud?
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.120]   I don't know what it is.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   Is it other?
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.120]   Could be other.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   I doubt it's other.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.360]   I bet you it's down there in the cloud.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.160]   What cracks me up is other bets, their revenue.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.680]   $80 billion, $78 million.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.040]   The losses on that?
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.040]   $1.1 billion.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:07.880]   $1.1 billion with a B. It's like, oof.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   Oof.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.520]   Oof, poor ad is not quite-- wait, what?
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.560]   Does the cash bring to hold your pocket?
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.080]   Ooh.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.080]   Well, they do so well into your--
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.160]   I heard hot pockets.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.120]   They do so--
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.840]   It's disgusting while you're hot pocket.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.080]   Don't eat hot pockets.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.240]   Well, that's-- I was like more bad food from Jeff.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:27.920]   Oh, dear.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.920]   Hey.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.280]   Hey.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.240]   Hey.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   I'm not healthy food.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.840]   I hear Jeff Jarvis eats his pop tarts raw.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.840]   I hear that.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   I don't know about you, but I hear that.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.680]   When I was a kid, I did.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.200]   Yep.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.560]   I made frozen.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.480]   Whoa, that's hardcore.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.120]   They're good.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.320]   So more spending on that.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:51.920]   I get back to McDonald's.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.520]   Yeah, more spending on that.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.880]   It's just you and me, baby.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:01.160]   Hey, I would like to point out the Google Cloud
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.160]   did really well year over year.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.680]   It's nothing compared to Amazon's cloud revenue, but the increase--
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.680]   I mean, it's a sizable increase.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.160]   So somewhere, someone is buying Google Cloud.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.200]   They're a distant third, though, right?
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:18.680]   I mean--
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.240]   So distant.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   Yeah, so distant.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   So distant.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.000]   Was it Amazon and Azure and then Google?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.080]   And actually, I can pull up the--
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.480]   That's the order.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.080]   But boy, when you look at the sizes, it's Amazon.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.400]   Amazon?
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.480]   Right, Amazon is Azure.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.480]   Azure.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.040]   That-- that different, huh?
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.120]   That's the audio version of that one.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.720]   Amazon's hefty, hefty, hefty.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.240]   Oh.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.240]   Google's not going to save me this kind of time.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.440]   Beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.280]   Here, you want to get the--
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:55.680]   you want to get the--
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.200]   you want to get the--
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.720]   you want to get the--
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.920]   AWS revenue, let's see.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.720]   11.6 billion is their cloud revenue from this last quarter.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.680]   Google-- oh, Google's--
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.320]   whoa, was 3.4 billion.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.200]   And Microsoft was 13 billion.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   Ooh.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   What was Microsoft for?
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   So actually--
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:18.960]   So, Azure's catching up.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.680]   But Microsoft--
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.960]   no, Azure's beat AWS revenue.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.200]   But I think Microsoft Cloud revenue has--
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.200]   Well, it has other stores.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.000]   It's actually down 3%.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.280]   They have-- I wonder if they have Office--
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.520]   you know, Microsoft 365.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.200]   Yeah, I think 365 is in there.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:35.680]   Yeah, it's--
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.920]   Azure-- Azure revenue grew 48% year over year,
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.840]   but they didn't give you an Azure total.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.480]   None of these guys break it out well enough
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.240]   that we can really compare apples to apples.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.120]   I love this chart.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.440]   It does-- it's not quite related.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.280]   It's from inside.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.200]   It's on market cap.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.920]   So, two Google's equals one apple.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   OK.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.160]   Four Walmart's equals one Amazon.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.040]   Amazon's market cap is 1.6 trillion.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.640]   Apple's is 2 trillion.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.000]   It takes eight lifts to equal one Uber.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.720]   Ten zooms to equal one Microsoft.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.840]   Actually, that surprises me.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.840]   I would have thought it would be--
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.800]   Well, zooms doing well because, you know,
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.760]   their market cap's gone up a lot.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.600]   It's 147 billion.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.800]   Microsoft is almost 1.6 trillion.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.880]   It's up there with Amazon.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.720]   It's really Apple, Amazon, Microsoft.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.480]   Totally dominant.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.280]   My favorite though is Facebook's market cap was $790 billion
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.720]   compared to Twitter's of $38 billion.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.440]   That means there's 20 Twitters to one Facebook.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.520]   That really puts it in perspective.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.760]   It does.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.000]   What about-- if you broke out YouTube,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.680]   YouTube would probably be--
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.080]   they don't break it out.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.280]   They'd probably be a big chunk of it.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.880]   Well, there was--
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.680]   I didn't know anything.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.000]   In one of the stories, they said YouTube's a problem, basically.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.320]   Oh.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.560]   It's high expense revenue that is high.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.680]   I forget where I saw that.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.440]   Huh.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.640]   Well, I'm sure the expense--
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.640]   Yeah, if it's big enough, you have to break it out.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.800]   If it becomes material, you need to.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.760]   So I don't understand how that we get away with it otherwise.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   The SEC would call.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.960]   I will see PAs now on the chart.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.480]   So this is the first time-- actually, I think it was last
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.880]   quarter was the first time YouTube ad revenue was disclosed.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.400]   This is a story from ad age in February.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.800]   It topped $15 billion in all of 2019.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.280]   But--
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.400]   High expounds.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.720]   The expenses are huge.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:45.240]   So it's not super profitable because the cost of revenue,
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:50.480]   like content acquisition costs $21 billion.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.080]   So that was up from 18.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.000]   And then don't forget, they've got to run all those servers.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.480]   Wait a second.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.720]   21 billion is that for sure?
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.240]   Is that money they have paid the music companies and stuff?
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.480]   It just had cost of revenue.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:08.080]   So the revenue was 15, but it cost them $21 billion to make it.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.560]   It gives you some idea.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.600]   You know, it's pretty amazing.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   That's why those YouTube ad sense checks are so small, huh?
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.160]   Can't afford it.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.920]   Well, and think about what YouTube does.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.200]   And we upload our videos to YouTube instantly.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.480]   And you know this, because you put stuff on YouTube, too.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:35.440]   They are compiling it for a dozen different formats,
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.680]   different stream speeds.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.000]   They do huge amounts of transcoding,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.920]   which is a huge compute load.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.920]   And then they have to store all those.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.960]   And then they have to store all those versions.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.320]   It's kind of amazing what they do at scale.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.000]   Google must find some value in it.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.040]   I mean, I guess.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:03.400]   Well, maybe that it's important because of the other aspects
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.960]   of it, like the TV side of it.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.000]   That's probably why they're still keeping it around
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.200]   because of the whole live TV thing.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.040]   Or is that about to flop to?
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.800]   I don't know why.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.600]   Or the world screams, "Break up Google!"
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.760]   And they say, "Fine, fine, fine."
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.880]   Oh, yeah, there's that.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.040]   Thank you, too.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.680]   "Fine."
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.040]   All right.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.400]   Take that off our books, please.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.200]   Thanks.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.320]   I don't know.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.000]   What do you think?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.840]   They generate-- they spin off so much cash
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.680]   with their search and ads that they get afforded.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.880]   They probably think it's got an upside.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.440]   There's a future there.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.800]   I'm glad they-- I mean, look, I'm grateful.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.640]   There's so much good stuff on YouTube.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.560]   There's a lot of bad stuff.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.800]   But there is so much useful stuff.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.640]   You know, my son learned to cook on YouTube.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.440]   But people learned to play--
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.520]   Yeah, I've said a gazillion times that I watch YouTube
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.080]   pretty much just as much as I would watch Netflix,
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:53.880]   if not more.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.280]   It's an ed-- and it's educational.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.520]   There's a lot of different documentaries out there
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.200]   that the algorithm just seems to know what to suggest to me.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.040]   That I never knew even existed.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.960]   And it's all on YouTube.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.400]   There's not-- it's not anywhere else.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.040]   It's on YouTube.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.680]   OK, there is going to be one election story,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.840]   but it's a little one.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.120]   So--
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.840]   The Prop 22 pass?
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.520]   Yes, it did.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.000]   That's actually a big-- that's a big story for us, isn't it?
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.720]   So that gives Uber and Lyft drivers--
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.200]   Uber and Lyft to not hire their drivers
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.800]   to keep their drivers as independent contractors.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.720]   Is it any other companies under that?
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.560]   Like journalism?
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.280]   Any other industries under that?
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.960]   It was just specific to those--
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:40.240]   just app-based workers, app-based--
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.240]   So cleaning--
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.760]   If I have an app for cleaning people,
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.920]   that would be the same thing?
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.440]   That's right.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.000]   OK.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.240]   App-based transportation and delivery--
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.000]   Delivery--
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Oh, just transportation.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.800]   Oh, my.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.520]   That's a special case.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.440]   So it's-- yeah, well, I mean, it was written by Uber and Lyft.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.440]   Sponsored by Uber and Lyft.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.920]   By the way, it looks like the California--
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.240]   the new California privacy law also passed.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.240]   Yes.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.640]   Hey, you wrote about that--
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.600]   Or Proposition 24, which is really interesting.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:19.240]   But that actually was not the story I was going to tell you
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.040]   about.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.760]   Remember, com.com, our sponsor-- com.sponsored.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.640]   CNN's key race alerts, and they noticed a huge spike.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.680]   A huge spike in traffic after that.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.400]   And they're airing the 32nd commercial, which
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.600]   is just rain falling on leaves and saying, breathe deep now.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.600]   Brilliant.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.600]   Brilliant.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.600]   Brilliant placement.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.600]   Brilliant.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.600]   Well done.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.480]   Screwball whiskey should have sponsored it, because I
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.160]   think they would have really done good, but OK.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.000]   Yep.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.760]   So we have a-- so the story of the California privacy
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.280]   proposition is kind of interesting,
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.720]   because it was originally going to be on the ballot last year.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.360]   And the legislature and Silicon Valley
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.680]   was so concerned about it.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.760]   They made a deal with McTaggart.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.440]   To have as McTaggart.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.720]   The-- I don't know what he sounds like.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.160]   But I imagine he sounds like the groundskeeper,
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.760]   groundskeeper Willie on the Simpsons.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.000]   I don't know why, just his name, Alistair McTaggart.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.840]   He made a deal with the legislature.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.360]   OK.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.280]   You passed your bill.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.560]   But he was unhappy.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.920]   And he went back on the ballot and won.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.720]   So proposition 24, it was controversial,
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.320]   because Facebook did not fight it.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.880]   And so there's some concern that maybe this
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.320]   is one of those laws that will--
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.240]   You don't know something.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.840]   Well, no, the Facebook could afford--
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.640]   It's regulatory capture.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.880]   It's regulatory capture.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.560]   Facebook could afford to do this, but no little guy can.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:02.280]   So in a way, this is a law that protects Facebook's incumbency.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.920]   The new data privacy law will do some of the things
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.320]   that the legislature passed to bill did not.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.440]   It'll let businesses-- much like GDPR--
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.600]   tell businesses to limit the use of sensitive data
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.240]   like exact location, health information, race, and religion.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.040]   It limits how long businesses can hold on to the data.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:26.040]   It allows the government to find companies up to $7,500
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.040]   for each violation of children's privacy rights,
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.120]   creates a new state agency-- this was partly the controversy--
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.040]   to enforce the privacy law, investigate violations,
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.960]   and access penalties.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.360]   But you have to be big.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.640]   You have to be 100,000 households a year or larger
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.560]   to be affected by this law.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:53.720]   So Alistair McTaggart got his way.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.320]   It looks like, yeah, I think we're
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.520]   giving him-- the projection is 56%.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.720]   Yes, 43%, 44% no.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:08.840]   I look at that in seed that you have the pose inside of it.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.920]   And I still didn't quite understand
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.600]   why people would oppose or companies would oppose this.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.280]   Welcome to California.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:22.560]   I mean, because I try to look at all of these just
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.880]   from the middle of the room and try to see both sides of it,
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.200]   even down to the Uber and Lyft.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.200]   Was it Prop 22?
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.400]   Because I could see both sides.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:31.840]   That's right.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.120]   But at the end of the day, I figured out, you know what?
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.880]   I'd rather take an Uber or Lyft versus a 10.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.440]   I voted yes on it.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.200]   It's their choice.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.440]   But well, that wasn't all the reason I voted.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.000]   You can argue against it.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.560]   I understand that the point of it is to protect workers.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.160]   I mean, we're getting-- I mean, this is kind of like the Amazon
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:55.800]   question, right?
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:01.080]   Amazon, it optimizes for cheap consumer goods
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.160]   that are rapidly accessed by us, which is what we want.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.600]   But it doesn't take into account the costs of ignoring
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.240]   all of the costs that it takes to provide us with those things.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:17.600]   So we might want this, just like I want to eat sugar every day
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.320]   all this time.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.240]   But I also would like to keep my teeth.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:25.880]   And the problem is these things don't take into account
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.560]   the externalities into effect.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:32.040]   And that we want what isn't always good for us
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.560]   long term as a society.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.560]   Mm-hmm.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.060]   Yeah.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:36.800]   No stuff.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.880]   Like I said, I looked at it--
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.000]   at all of them, I tried to look at it from the middle of the road
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.440]   so I could see both sides of it.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:47.920]   And it made me think about when I moved here last year
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.000]   in the controversy I had with the state of California
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.200]   being an independent contractor.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.120]   You lost your gig with the--
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.120]   Right.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.400]   The more public workers.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.520]   And it struck a nerve with me.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.000]   So I was thinking about that.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.360]   But then I also considered that, heck, the state
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:09.120]   just want some extra revenues for Suda, state unemployment.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.640]   If they can get it because it's independent,
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.160]   I'm pretty sure a lot of independent contractors out there
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.080]   whether they're riding Lyft or driving for Lyft or Uber
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.280]   probably fudging those tax records too.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.120]   You never know.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.760]   I was swayed by the fact that I know a lot of people like you,
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.480]   Aunt, people in our business, tech journalists and so forth
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.120]   who are freelancers who couldn't work in California anymore.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.680]   I lost a lot of money.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.040]   And so that's what it meant.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.680]   AB5, this bill, I think fairly ill conceived
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.640]   and had a lot of bad unintended consequences.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:48.080]   But then I agree with you, Stacey.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.000]   You want to protect workers against predatory corporations
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.040]   like Twit that will hire contract employees like you guys
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.360]   and give you no benefits.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.320]   Well, the challenge is you'll pay for it elsewhere, eventually.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.320]   So it does.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.800]   So you're either going to-- yeah, you're
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.240]   going to pay for--
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.600]   if they don't have health insurance,
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.120]   you're going to pay for more expensive hospital bills,
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.720]   for example, through tech.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.240]   Right.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.240]   Right.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.920]   I mean, we have--
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.480]   I mean, I think employer-based health insurance
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.560]   kind of really distorts the market.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.080]   But that is kind of what we have here.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.160]   But that's where you're going to see this.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.000]   So yes, you will be able to take a cheap lift somewhere.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.800]   But you're also going to pay for it with someone
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.960]   somewhere near turbipus.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.920]   Or you're just going to have a bunch of homeless people who
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.960]   can't access health care.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.680]   And that is currently happening, too.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.920]   But what also happens to me, is that maybe one of those people
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:46.120]   who's unemployed couldn't be employed except for the law.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.400]   I run into it, too, even in my school.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.920]   If I want to hire somebody just to write one research piece,
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.040]   I have to hire them on staff.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.160]   Or else they have to prove that they have a consulting
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:56.440]   business.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.200]   They have to have business cards and letterheads,
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.600]   as if anybody uses those things anymore.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.640]   And client lists and all this stuff.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.440]   And that means that I don't hire them.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.800]   And so people lose work as a result.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.400]   That is true.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:10.960]   And--
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.440]   And--
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.040]   --lost his gig, right?
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.520]   On the other hand, AC--
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.840]   I tried to finagle it with my LLC,
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.080]   because my LLC was still active in North Carolina.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.040]   Lawyers was like, nah.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.400]   You could do that, I think.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.880]   Oh, it says, yeah.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.480]   No, when you use the word finagle,
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.360]   it usually means--
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:29.840]   --sneagled.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.280]   --probably--
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280]   --neagled.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.920]   --that's a red flag.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.320]   You're probably squirreling.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:34.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.920]   --there are go-ons.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.720]   --I'm just saying--
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.640]   --my favorite Martian.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.400]   --hanging it.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.320]   You've finagled it.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.800]   You've never had my favorite Martian?
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.680]   No, it's just you and me again.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.200]   --the Russian.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.480]   What is happening?
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.560]   Old TV shows.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:51.520]   Remember, don't forget, Jeff used to be a TV guide critic.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.440]   You knew that, right?
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.040]   Right, right.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.480]   I recall seeing this somewhere.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.120]   At least once.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:03.040]   So, you know, we always have--
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.040]   part of-- I think--
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.160]   I mean, I have always attributed it
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.040]   to the cowardice of the California state legislature
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.440]   that they just didn't want to vote on these tough issues.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.400]   So they said, let the voters decide.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.120]   The other hand, I'm a fan of democracy.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.400]   So I can't really argue against it.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.280]   Kamala Harris was against Prop 22,
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.400]   so was Elizabeth Warren, so was Joe Biden,
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.560]   so was the American Federation of State, County,
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.480]   and Municipal Employees in the California Labor Federation
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.040]   in the ACLU of Southern California.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.560]   And there were a lot of people against it,
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.480]   including gig workers rising.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.400]   But there were also a lot of people for it.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.680]   It was a very difficult one.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.680]   And I think it's just not clear.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.480]   And I think everybody should do what you did, Ant, which
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.040]   is really weigh it, the pros and cons,
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.600]   and do the best you could decide.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.000]   Yeah, a lot of people go into these elections
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.400]   with just totally irrational.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.720]   You know, it's a super-emotional--
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.320]   It's a lot easier to vote that way, just to say.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.680]   I know how I'm going to vote.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.800]   But then a lot of people like Baby Shark.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.560]   And you understand, we can't hold that again.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:19.000]   You know what?
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Someone please take my ears from you.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   And I don't even have a kid, and that is like--
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   You have a kid.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   I got that news for you.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   You don't watch Ted Lassett.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Yes, Lach said Lassett.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.720]   I think of that age.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:39.080]   So when the singer or when the fancy soccer player started
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.080]   singing his name to Baby Shark, it's like--
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.080]   Was that funny?
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.040]   [GRUNTING]
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.000]   It had been out of my head for so long.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.400]   It was culturally right on.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.040]   It was well-targeted.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.840]   Was that show only on Apple TV?
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.040]   Yes, only on Apple TV.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   Do you think Baby Shark will be the new Rick role?
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.600]   If you ever think of a say about it--
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:02.600]   Excellent.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.720]   Our show today brought to you by LastPass.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.960]   Here we are in the beautiful LastPass studio.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.000]   Thank you, LastPass.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.160]   This has been a tough year for us,
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:20.000]   and I think every media outlet, every podcast, quarantine,
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:20.520]   really hurt.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.960]   But thank you, LastPass, for sponsoring the studio,
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.200]   keeping us afloat.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.280]   Really, it made a big difference.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.280]   So thank you, LastPass.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.440]   And you know what?
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.000]   It made me happy, because I've been
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.720]   using LastPass for a dozen years, since they first
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.320]   came out 12 years ago.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.880]   I talked Steve Gibson's ear off about it.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.320]   So finally, 10 years ago, he went and interviewed the creator,
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.240]   looked at all the code.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.520]   Joe C. Grist gave him a complete tour.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.920]   He said, wow, this is really good.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.880]   They're doing it right.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.000]   Steve's been using it for a decade, our security guide.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.480]   That was about six or seven years ago.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.200]   I think we started using it at Twit,
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.360]   because LastPass Enterprise is so valuable.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.680]   And you know, when we started sending people home
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.160]   to work from home during quarantine,
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.760]   we were thrilled that we still could send them home
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.120]   and feel safe.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:10.080]   And that was thanks to LastPass.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.200]   You know, you don't want to trust your most valuable data
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.000]   with just anybody.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.320]   That's why LastPass has been our choice for identity
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.200]   and access management for years.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.760]   We're not the only one.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.440]   They've been named a leader in the G2 fall grid reports,
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.480]   a leading peer-to-peer review site
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.600]   that provides unbiased user reviews on leading software
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.880]   solutions of the 746 customers that left user reviews
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.480]   their 93% rated LastPass 4 or 5 stars.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.880]   I'd give it 5 stars, for sure.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.560]   Couldn't be happier.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.560]   IT and security leaders can take back control
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.120]   of password security in your enterprise.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.880]   From a central dashboard, they see exactly who's using
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.000]   what, when, and where businesses can customize
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.760]   admin privileges.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.400]   I love the granularity of that,
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.040]   because you can give people access to just what they need
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.760]   and not anything more.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.400]   You get company-wide visibility,
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.800]   and that even gives you information about how strong
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.080]   your employees' passwords are,
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.920]   how well they're sticking to policies.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.560]   So you know that, you know, your training
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.360]   or your informational stuff is working.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:22.360]   And LastPass is so easy.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.720]   It'll integrate right into whatever you're using
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.520]   for onboarding users' syncing groups,
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.920]   revoking access, everything you use.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.600]   Admins get actionable insight.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.680]   They can access security scores,
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.040]   see real-time readouts of your business's password hygiene,
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.840]   track improvements over time, review audit reports,
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.320]   build compliance, maintain accountability
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.120]   with detailed reporting logs,
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.040]   the tie actions to individuals.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.520]   For every employee, you can view their password scores,
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.240]   gain access to shared accounts,
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.880]   monitor group memberships and more.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.320]   Look, we don't want to spy on our employees,
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.960]   but we do want to make sure that they're doing the right thing
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.920]   because they have access to our bank accounts,
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.560]   our websites, our data, our customer records, everything.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.200]   So you got to protect that.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.160]   We enabled two-factor authentication,
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.600]   but LastPass goes a step farther
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   with multi-factor authentication,
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.520]   adding contextual information like IP address
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.160]   and geolocation.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.680]   It makes it easy to log in,
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.840]   makes it easy to generate good, strong passwords
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.160]   and keep track of them.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.600]   So your employees will have good password hygiene,
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.120]   good security without a lot of effort.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.840]   In fact, they love it because it makes it so easy to just log in.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.920]   I think you're going to love LastPass.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.440]   I know you're going to love LastPass.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.280]   I think your employees are going to love LastPass.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.640]   They've won eight awards so far.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.040]   This year, PC Magazine's Editor's Choice,
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.520]   the Fortress Cyber Security Award Business Insider's
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.160]   Best Overall Password Manager, I can go on and on.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.040]   This is really the way to protect yourself and your business.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.880]   Let the award-winning LastPass help you take
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.600]   back control of password security.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.520]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:01.320]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.800]   We thank them so much.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.800]   From the bottom of my heart for keeping this show afloat.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.440]   - Thank you, LastPass. - Thank you, LastPass.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.720]   - You're grateful. - Yeah.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.760]   - Thank you. - I mean, I love what we do.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.000]   I think we do great content.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.800]   We have a great audience,
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.000]   but we don't charge anybody for access.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.840]   I don't want to.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.120]   I want to make it accessible anywhere you want to listen.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.440]   I want to do the best job we can.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.200]   It's thanks to our really loyal sponsors that we can do that.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.560]   So we appreciate it.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   I appreciate it.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:39.200]   Ad, Jack Dorsey's keeping his job despite the beard.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.040]   - Yay.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:40.880]   Is he keeping the beard?
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:41.720]   'Cause that could go.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:42.560]   - Yeah.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.080]   Apparently, Ellie-- - Jack it's nice.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.360]   - The jacket's good and the nose ring.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.320]   And look, look at those blue eyes.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.920]   Although, don't you think those pupils are a little tiny?
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.200]   I don't know.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.280]   - He's in bright light.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.240]   - Oh, that's right. - He's in bright light.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.240]   That's of course.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.040]   - He's on an aperture.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:03.480]   - He's like F's 22, at least.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.960]   - Yes.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.440]   - Elliot Management, which was a very activist investor
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.760]   and was always a concern when they joined the board.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:13.480]   Apparently was, you know, kind of say,
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   we gotta get rid of this guy.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.440]   But Twitter said it in a filing on Monday
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.800]   that a board committee formed this spring
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.000]   were recommended that the current management structure
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:24.840]   remain in place.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.400]   I don't know if that's the right thing.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.120]   I mean, Jack's a wonderful guy.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.840]   I'm not knocking Jack.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.680]   But we've heard complaints from Twitter staff
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.600]   that he's not really very present.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.120]   He delegates everything.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.200]   He's got another company, he's running.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.920]   But who are you gonna put in there?
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.280]   Nobody knows. - Doc's doubled
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.840]   the last what?
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.240]   - Six months.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.240]   - They're doing okay.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.400]   Yeah, about 20%.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.480]   - They're not gonna get rid of him.
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.960]   Makes sense for us him being hands off and things like that.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:05.280]   But I still argue that some of the best leaders out there
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.320]   are the ones that surround themselves
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.800]   with the hell of a team to where they can delegate
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.280]   and just oversee things and not necessarily
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.120]   always being there right in the code
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.040]   flipping the switches.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.080]   They're just sort of directing them.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.280]   - Yeah, you got a point, Ann.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.960]   Twitter used to be in place
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.080]   where executives didn't last long.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.040]   They all left.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.240]   - Yeah, they're sticking around.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.080]   - Yeah.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:30.080]   - And like my daughter was actually,
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.400]   she was making, you know, 'cause she's 14
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.400]   and she's in the throes of like incredible liberalism.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.560]   And she is talking about Jeff Bezos
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.560]   and man, what does he even do all day?
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.880]   You know, and I was like, well, actually,
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.360]   as the CEO of a ginormous company, his big picture.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.800]   He's the big true guy, you know?
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.640]   And so I think the best CEOs have an understanding
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.600]   of what they wanna do with the company,
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.080]   how the company fits in the world
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.400]   and how to strategically position the company.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.160]   But that's, they're not like,
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.760]   Ann said, they're not right in the code or flipping switches.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.320]   They're thinking-- - Oh, and founders,
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.240]   founders would do well to do that
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.040]   and let professional managers do the day-to-day operation.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.200]   So-- - That's a complaint
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.920]   about Zuckerberg, 'cause he doesn't do that.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.920]   - Yeah, he's two hands. - So he's two hands.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.160]   - Look, Emily, you can't win, yeah.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.000]   - Yeah.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.260]   - How did Twitter handle the election?
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:26.000]   - I don't know, I haven't been looking.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.400]   - I don't know, I didn't--
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.960]   - I'm looking at the president's last few tweets.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:32.840]   Official sources may not have called the race
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:33.960]   when this was tweeted.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.320]   Some are all of the content shared
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.000]   and this tweet is disputed.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.400]   Might be misleading about an election
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.640]   and our other civic process.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.000]   They're very much-- - Got some flags on them.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.880]   - Weighing in on the president's tweets.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.200]   One, two, three, he tweeted, he tweeted,
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.000]   what is this all about in caps?
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.520]   And they said, some are all over the content shared.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.720]   What is this all about?
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.000]   Some are all over the content shared
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.840]   and this tweet is disputed, huh?
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:03.080]   Okay.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.360]   And then some of the tweets I just can't even see.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.280]   So yeah, they've definitely doubled down
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:15.680]   despite scrutiny and complaints by Republicans.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.720]   They've doubled down on this.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.800]   But they said-- - They said they did it.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.800]   - And this is the key, I was gonna say,
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.880]   to keep it there, they were gonna do something
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.240]   and then they did it. - Yeah.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.520]   - They said, we're gonna, you know,
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.120]   if there's any false claims of victory,
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.120]   we are gonna stop down in these ways
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.000]   and then they went and did it.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.200]   That's what we expected of them.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.040]   - Good.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:32.880]   - How about Facebook?
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.840]   Has Facebook been-- - They did.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:37.320]   I had a business insider story up with there were examples,
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.760]   I think from Facebook as well.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.240]   Yeah, they did similar things.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.760]   They weren't even as different.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.080]   - A little more ambiguous.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:43.920]   - Yeah.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.160]   - But yes, they did.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.440]   - Yeah.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.360]   So they said they would,
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:51.240]   they've also both said that they would not accept
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.080]   political ads now after the election.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.640]   - Can you imagine?
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.600]   - Because I guess the theory--
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.360]   - That's not as interesting because,
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.440]   yeah, they're gonna be like trying to sway people
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.440]   in scary ways like, I mean, you see the stuff
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.160]   that they're not showing you from Donald Trump
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.000]   is talking about like making up ballots
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.160]   and finding things that destroying things.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:15.360]   So imagine that being advertised throughout Facebook
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.160]   and being normalized is something that actually is happening.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.520]   - Right.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.640]   - That would be terrible.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.480]   - Yeah.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:26.800]   - Do you all think they both,
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.800]   Twitter and Facebook have done a good job?
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.040]   - I'm not on, I wasn't on either.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.800]   - I can't say.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.640]   At the end, yeah.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.960]   - I'm sorry.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.160]   I was like-- - Okay.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.680]   - You know what's my job to have an opinion
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.680]   that I was like, I just couldn't bear it.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.240]   - Yeah.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.240]   - So I just looked up to Facebook.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.600]   - I think it's hard because--
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.880]   - Oh.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.720]   - Go ahead, Stacey.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.560]   It's hard because--
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.040]   - Oh, I was just gonna say, it's hard
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:53.760]   because you have a leader who is, you know,
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.000]   very good at using these platforms to spread.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   I'm gonna, it's misinformation.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.400]   And it is hard to say, hey, we're not gonna, I mean,
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.720]   it's hard to say that your president is a liar,
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.560]   which is essentially what you're having to say
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.800]   if you block this content, right?
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:11.640]   - Yeah.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:16.640]   - So I appreciate that we should not,
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.440]   we should be above this, but we're not.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.280]   - And--
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:23.920]   - It's really interesting to me,
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.200]   now that the election, you know, many,
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.560]   not all of the votes have been counted,
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.380]   the election is almost over,
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:32.880]   that the nation is not completely evenly divided,
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.560]   but fairly evenly divided.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:41.360]   And you could see how,
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:46.760]   at least half the nation would be unhappy
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:49.120]   with what Twitter and Facebook are doing.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.080]   Yeah, right?
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.920]   - Yeah.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.160]   - But that shouldn't stop them.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.760]   - Well, and I think half the nation would be unhappy
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.560]   because for the last four years and longer, really,
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.520]   half the nation has been buying--
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.360]   - Right.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:10.360]   - And it's something that they've bought into lies.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.400]   I don't know how else to say it.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.880]   - But half the nation doesn't think there are lies.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.720]   That's only--
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.880]   - But it doesn't matter, they are--
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:18.720]   - A lie is a lie.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.000]   - I mean, some of these, like,
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.360]   it's one thing to be like, I buy into a certain narrative,
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.200]   but it's another thing to say,
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.320]   I believe something that is patently untrue.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.200]   And a lot of people do believe something
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.560]   that is patently true.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.040]   And I'm not saying that's what swayed their votes
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.600]   or anything, but--
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:40.120]   - I'm just, I guess my question is,
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:43.920]   the country did not repudiate President Trump.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.880]   - Oh, no.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.320]   - There wasn't a mass like Blue Wave and like,
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.760]   oh, we repudiate this guy.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.040]   It basically showed a very much stronger,
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.040]   you know, a lot of support,
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:56.200]   not quite enough perhaps to win the election.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.320]   We don't know yet.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.320]   But a lot of support.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:03.240]   So does that affect things?
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.040]   I mean, as somebody who thinks he's a liar,
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:11.040]   is it is only, you know, it's not universally agreed.
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.240]   - So I thought about this.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.240]   - But he is a liar.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.840]   - Okay.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.680]   - Yes.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.520]   - I'm sorry.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.600]   You have to-- - Well, facts are facts.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:24.680]   You can't, despite Kelly Ann Conway's assertion
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:27.160]   that there are alternate facts, you cannot.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.800]   Facts are facts.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:32.680]   - Well, but no, in an age of epistemological war,
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.280]   if I don't like you, I don't like your facts.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.120]   - Right.
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:38.960]   - I wrote a post right before the election
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:43.520]   about which I reread parts of Hannah Arran's,
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.200]   The Origins of Totalitarianism,
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.320]   'cause I'm that kind of fun guy who reads this stuff
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.160]   in my spare time.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.240]   - That is an amazing book though.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.400]   That's the book everybody should read, right?
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.080]   - And it was very limiting.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.240]   I'm not trying to call Hitler and style on models for Trump.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.160]   I'm just trying to say that it is a totalitarian,
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.360]   authoritarian mood here.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.440]   And people maybe realize, and I wrote this post,
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.400]   and I said that I don't believe the people
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:08.640]   who espouse picket QAnon or that lies, believe it.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.200]   I believe they want us to believe they believe it.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.640]   That it's, at first level, it's performative.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.400]   I'm gonna own you, I'm gonna piss you off,
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:21.000]   you liberals, you media, you elites.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.320]   But at another level, it's not about facts.
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.720]   It's not about beliefs either, it's about emotions.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.280]   And so it could be true as truth.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.640]   - Turn on your emotions.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:36.640]   I mean, that's one of the biggest ways to disrespect people
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.280]   is just to own their emotions
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.880]   and be able to manipulate them and pull their strings.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.080]   And you don't really have a care in a world form.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:44.920]   - What's up?
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:47.320]   - You just want to pull their strings
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.760]   and poke the bear kind of thing
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.600]   and just to watch them react.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:53.040]   There's some people to get off on that.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.440]   And if this is the case-- - Yeah, and then that's what--
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.200]   - The likes of QAnon, that's pretty strong.
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.040]   - I mean, you're right, Ant.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.520]   And it's not just QAnon, it's also political leaders
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.360]   and it's certain parts of media.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.440]   And what our Ant talks about is that the roots
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.520]   of totalitarianism are loneliness.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:14.040]   The people are lonely that they are not associated
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.920]   that they're alienated.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.960]   Now, one could go too far with that.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.800]   - I feel like it's different.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.800]   - I feel like it's different.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.160]   It's loneliness.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.760]   - She's a tribal opposite.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.880]   - She's really-- - She's the opposite.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.400]   That actually, it's because you don't belong to groups
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.320]   that you don't have an identity.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.720]   - Well, you don't have an individuality.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.640]   - That does not apply. - Then this thing
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.720]   comes along to fill in the void.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.760]   - That does not apply to the current situation in the US then.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.400]   'Cause that's not, that's patently not the case.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.240]   - I can believe that.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.400]   There's lots of people who feel maybe loneliness is,
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:53.520]   their sense of purpose has been eroded, I think.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.760]   And-- - Perhaps, I would say maybe more
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.960]   that they feel let down by the people in power,
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.080]   by government, but I think they don't feel alone.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.200]   - We have to evolve and let down by the people in power.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.240]   - Yeah, they feel alone-- - There's a, I mean,
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.720]   like, I feel-- - Yeah, I feel--
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.080]   - They don't feel a part of the elites.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.760]   They don't like the elites, but I think that they know
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.840]   that there's a large movement.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.120]   How do you feel alone when this--
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.200]   - It's has your own in the crowd.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.360]   What they argue is-- - I think it's here.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.680]   - There's a lot of sociology about this.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.480]   You're alone in the crowd.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.800]   Yes, you seem to be in a crowd,
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.840]   but you're in fact, incredibly lonely.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.400]   'Cause you're not, and how many people do we know
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.600]   who we're gonna give up friends and relatives,
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.520]   but not Trump, right?
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.760]   So the associations that you would think matter
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.680]   in their lives, they were ready to throw away.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.480]   That's what she argues.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.000]   - Stacy, exactly the least. - I'm sorry.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.720]   I didn't mean to cut you off, go ahead.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.400]   - No, no, sorry, I was listening to Jeff.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.960]   And I was like, yeah.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.960]   And I also think, yeah, you can be lonely for,
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:55.400]   like when everybody around you seems to believe
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.080]   something that just makes sense to you.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.720]   So like as a Democrat in Texas,
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.360]   you know, I thought-- - But that's a lonely.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.200]   - Yeah.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.160]   (laughing)
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.160]   Now I feel less lonely, but-- - Yes.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.360]   - If you, the nation,
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.600]   if you read the papers and you look at the way,
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.600]   like, I mean, think about watching our show.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.720]   We have a clear perspective where we talk about
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.080]   like, this is clearly wrong.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.840]   We clearly espouse this.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.160]   If you don't believe that, you're like,
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.480]   man, I've listed a Leo and Jeff, like half my life.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.520]   And-- - A lot of people are mad.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.760]   - They're not as well. - I thought.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.880]   - Yeah, no, well-- - And that makes you lonely.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.720]   - Yeah.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.240]   Or hate Leo and Jeff.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.920]   (laughing)
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.560]   More like, at least-- - Yeah, but you also--
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:46.720]   - But for a while, they probably felt a kinship with you.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.600]   And suddenly that's, I mean, it's confusing when,
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.400]   like, I mean, we've all had those moments
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.680]   when, like, a friend says something and you're like,
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.040]   what?
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.360]   - This is-- - How did I know you
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.320]   for this vlog? - I would agree with that.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.160]   This is an upsetting time for everybody.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.000]   I would agree with that.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.600]   Whatever, whatever tribe you believe.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.640]   - True colors have come out in 2019, 2020.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.160]   I can say that for sure.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.040]   And my side, too. - Yeah.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.920]   And that's why I'm a fan of Baby Shark.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.200]   - Seems to be-- - Do you need to do that?
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.920]   - Seems like a one true thing in this world.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.440]   - You can all lay out the way you quit being a piece.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.280]   - The one consistent thing with you.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.640]   - But you two now, please. (laughing)
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.480]   - Go on.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.400]   (imitating bird sounds)
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.320]   - I had never heard the song when we saw it in Dubai.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.520]   I said, this is catchy. - Boy, it was a song.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.360]   There's a stretch.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.040]   - I said, this is a catchy, catchy little number.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.120]   And Lisa said, you'd never heard that before.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.080]   I said, no.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.500]   She said it's on YouTube.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.040]   And I watched it a billion times.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.120]   She was like a three year old.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.000]   - Hey, what do you think of Dx?
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.480]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.680]   And not particularly bright three year old, actually.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:57.040]   What do you think of DxO Mark?
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:02.120]   And they gave the Pixel 5 camera a 120 point
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.440]   square out of 100.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.440]   - I think you and I may have discussed it
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.280]   off the 100 in the past.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.760]   - Might be a leading question.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.440]   I might-- - Yeah.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.520]   - What is DxO Mark? - At one point in time,
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.080]   I thought pretty highly of DxO, DxO Mark,
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.920]   but it seems like--
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.240]   - Stacey wants to know what DxO Mark is.
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.080]   What are they?
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:22.920]   - Sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.760]   - They're part of the organization
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.160]   that does a lot of camera review, far as looking
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.480]   at the specs and checks and balances of whatever camera
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.480]   that comes out with us on a phone or just
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.800]   a actual camera body.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.200]   - They also sell software, right?
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.080]   - And then they have a processing software as well.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:44.080]   - They probably make money testing for companies,
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.960]   usually companies like this.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:50.960]   They have a testing facility and they probably test for--
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.800]   - Say that loosely though, at least from the way things look.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.920]   I'm gonna say it loosely.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.680]   - It is not the highest rated camera out.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.160]   The Huawei Mate 40 Pro is 136 points.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.680]   Weirdly though, the Samsung Galaxy Note Ultra
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.600]   is only 89 points.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.760]   (laughing)
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.880]   - Samsung didn't write the check.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.960]   - Do you think?
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.800]   (laughing)
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.000]   - Oh. - I'm gonna say it.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.200]   Samsung didn't write the check.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.280]   It just seems like a lot of times with this.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.360]   So things are coming off as if they've
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.400]   are on the take.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.240]   I'll just say it.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.080]   - I don't care.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.280]   - The top four of their smartphone cameras
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.720]   are all Chinese companies.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.480]   Huawei's Mate 40 Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra,
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.320]   Huawei P40 Pro.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.160]   Either way, the Huawei cameras are really good.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.480]   I will say they are.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.000]   I haven't used one since the P20,
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   but Xiaomi's Mi 10 Pro and the Vivo X50 Pro Plus,
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.360]   those are the top five.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.960]   - Yeah.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.920]   So I just can't put a lot of stock into them.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.760]   - Yeah.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.240]   - I've seen some things in the past
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.000]   where they'll headline things as this is the best camera
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.600]   ever kind of thing the same way Apple does with,
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.680]   this is our best iPhone ever with every new phone.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.160]   Yeah, we get it as your latest phone,
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.040]   so it better be your best.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.560]   But it just never seemed like there was a true meat
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.280]   to their testing, if you will.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:18.200]   - Have you played with the Pixel 5 yet,
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.960]   or are you gonna get one?
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.720]   - No, sir, Mr. How has it?
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.720]   - Yeah.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.560]   - Maybe he'd like to see it.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.560]   - I haven't been interested in it though,
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.880]   because quite frankly, I think the 4A is still just fine.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.280]   Even with this camera, it's still using the old tech.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.360]   It's the same camera.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.840]   - It's a computational, I'm not saying that.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.920]   - I'm not saying that it's a photography.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.840]   - Isn't it?
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:36.680]   - It's gonna work.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.720]   - It's, I think it's the same sensor.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.400]   - Yeah, wait a minute, the five, it is the same.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.280]   - Yeah, yes, so no, no need for me to go to the phone.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.880]   - What do you care about?
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.600]   - I like this 4A.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.400]   You're into it a little bit smaller.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.400]   I like this thing, but it is no need to really go up
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.520]   from that.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.600]   Computational photography is crushing it.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.560]   - It is really amazing.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:05.560]   Do any of the camera makers, Nikon or Canon or Sony,
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.520]   do any of them putting that kind of computational power
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.840]   into a camera, a DSLR?
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.600]   - I've not seen such.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.960]   - I wonder why not.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.160]   They're just, they're relying on optics.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.760]   - Yeah, as I was gonna say, you have lenses out there
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:27.000]   that's gonna really help make things even better
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.720]   right out the gate, because you got better glass.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.080]   And then they're looking at flange placement,
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.520]   flange size and how that affects the image quality as well.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.640]   So I mean, they got a lot of other things in place
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:42.240]   to not necessarily worry about AI stepping in.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.720]   - You just reviewed the new Panasonic Lumix,
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.120]   right on the hands-on technology.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.200]   - S5.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.400]   - Yeah, what do you think of that?
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.880]   - I think it's slightly overpriced,
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.920]   but it's a pretty good camera.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.720]   I think it's gonna be really nice for someone
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.640]   that's just wanting to do portraits.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.360]   From a videographer standpoint,
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.880]   it could use a little bit of help,
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.120]   but it's still quite capable.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.880]   I wonder what would happen if a company like Panasonic
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.240]   or Sony, I think they'd be the two most likely candidates,
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.960]   started to put processors and power and software in there
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:21.520]   to add the computational capability
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.960]   to their already superb optics.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.640]   Wouldn't that be good?
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.000]   Or you don't think they just know,
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:29.840]   there'd be no advantage?
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.440]   - I just wonder how that would affect the cost though.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.600]   What are the consumers gonna pay for?
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.640]   - Well, if you're getting the paint for a $5,000 camera
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.000]   that has overheating problems.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.720]   - Right, that's what I'm saying.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:48.720]   If you paid $5,000 for a body,
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.880]   if for $6,000 you'd get a body
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.560]   with all the computational abilities as well,
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:58.640]   that I would think that'd be interesting.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.480]   - For some.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.360]   - Yeah.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:03.840]   - You know, our photographers extra, I'm old,
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.760]   and I started, I did a photojournalism minor,
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:10.440]   and I did it on a film camera.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.240]   Because it was kind of in the middle
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.280]   of the transition, basically.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.080]   But at the time, and even after that,
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.000]   there was still a lot of snobbery
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.400]   in the traditional photojournalism world,
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.840]   or that.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.880]   So I wonder if the people with the money
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.120]   to buy these things who are older
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.600]   are kind of like, who can come,
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.560]   the computational photography,
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.200]   because it doesn't take talent and skill.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.120]   Which was the big thing, you know.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.960]   The big thing.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.440]   - Yeah, I've seen a lot of that years ago.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.400]   I don't see that as much now.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.400]   The snobbery or photography, I think,
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.040]   is actually going down just a little bit.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:50.880]   A little bit.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.720]   - Good.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.280]   - There's still some out there,
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.840]   but it's, I think nowadays people
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.600]   are starting to really open their eyes and saying,
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.200]   "Hey, why not just make this art available for everybody?
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.640]   "Let everybody get involved and try to expand on this art
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.360]   "and have fun with it and stop poo-pooing them
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.200]   "because they're shooting with the phone
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.640]   "and the computational photography and that phone."
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.640]   Just, "Hey, they just created some great art."
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:19.120]   So yeah, personally, I'm seeing less of the snobbery
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.160]   in comparison to what I used to see years ago.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.600]   - Of course, one of the things,
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.120]   and certainly when you studied photojournalism
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.760]   all those years ago, this was probably a big issue.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.440]   (laughs)
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.880]   - Was post-processing.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.720]   - Yeah.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.560]   - Right?
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.000]   So that was very snobbery.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.360]   I think that snobbery still persists
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.600]   where people say, "Well, you ran it through Photoshop."
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.800]   So it's still there, but again,
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.680]   I think it's going down some because
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.760]   if you crop your image, that's processed,
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.720]   that's post-processed.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.720]   - Yeah.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.480]   - And certainly-- - You could do things
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.160]   with chemicals in a dark room that are--
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.360]   - Right, dodge and play.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.560]   - Equally. - Yeah.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.320]   - Certainly photojournalists, that's one thing,
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.520]   because you're, there's a--
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.800]   - There are some standards with it.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.200]   - Of verusimilitude.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.280]   You don't want to modify the captured image.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.920]   But that doesn't mean there's a lot of photographers.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:16.960]   Our friend, Trey Radcliffe, I mean,
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.920]   he uses a lot of software.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:23.440]   His whole career is based on post-processing, basically.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.040]   - Yep, it's beautiful.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:25.840]   - And it's beautiful.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.160]   I mean, if it's not photojournalism,
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.720]   if you're not recording a factual event,
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.280]   I see no problem with it.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.320]   - That's the difference.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.160]   - Yeah.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.360]   - And I think a lot of those,
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.640]   I'll say it this way, old school photographers,
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.840]   finally accepted that.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.440]   You know, these people are just,
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.040]   again, they're just creating art.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:43.880]   - Yeah.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.720]   - You know, so let them create art.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.560]   Who am I to tell them that they should use
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.480]   a fine or two paintbrush versus that wide paintbrush?
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.320]   You know, it's--
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.160]   - Is that art?
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.280]   Nevertheless, I think going back to the original story,
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.800]   the Pixel 5 is, and your 4A, too,
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.400]   produces damn fine results with somewhat antiquated,
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.800]   less than good hardware
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:09.080]   by doing really spectacular computational stuff.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:09.920]   And that's really--
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.440]   - When Pera was playing with the 4A,
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.880]   and she yelled because she didn't like the camera.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.000]   Now, those were her words.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.960]   I don't like the camera on this thing.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.680]   And I had to tell her, I said, "Look,
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.840]   I don't care what phone you pick up.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.480]   You're gonna have some challenges
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.680]   if you try to take a photo of yourself
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.720]   doing a selfie here in our living room
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.520]   that's not brightly lit.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.360]   It's gonna have some noise,
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.760]   and it's gonna have some grain.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.120]   You know, you just gotta understand
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.440]   what you're working with from a visit standpoint,
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.280]   and then let the computational side just hop in
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.800]   and do the rest of the heavy lifting.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.640]   - Right.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.560]   - And I said, "Here, let me take a picture."
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.320]   Boom, it looks way better, right?
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.640]   You know.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.480]   - Oh, I bet she loves when you do that.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.320]   (laughing)
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.480]   Let me take a picture.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.800]   - You don't know what you're doing, lady.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.560]   Give me the camera, I'll show you.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.160]   - I like that at all.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.400]   (laughing)
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.040]   - You like living dangerously, don't you?
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.520]   - I have to challenge myself every now and then.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.040]   (laughing)
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.320]   - Walk on the wild side just to get--
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.680]   - So, can I make a--
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.320]   - Sorry.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.360]   - Can I interrupt with a little bit of
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.800]   Jeff Computer Advice since we're on hardware for a second?
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.480]   - Absolutely.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.640]   - So, you know, I've been complaining
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.640]   my Chromebook is gonna die,
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.360]   and so I went in the Best Buy and RISC Germs
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.920]   to look at the machines that are there.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.240]   I looked at the Go, I looked at the,
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.720]   a little Kevin Tofol at the ACES 713.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.360]   - Oh. - Keyboard on that one.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.080]   Didn't like it, just didn't like it.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.440]   So, I'm ready to say, "Okay, it's a Go."
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.560]   And then next to the Go is the,
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.680]   I first want to touch one, Samsung Galaxy Chromebook.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.760]   - I think they make excellent Chromebooks.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.600]   I have-- - Well, you know,
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.960]   the problem with it is-- - What?
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.400]   - The battery. - Oh.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.960]   - That the word on it was,
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.640]   it promises eight or nine hours,
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:58.440]   and some reviewers got four, some got maybe got more.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.920]   But they're saying that-- - I'm a Chromebook.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.000]   - The screen is bright, the screen is huge,
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.680]   that this is that, that,
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.360]   do you think there's any hope that it'll,
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.280]   then supposedly Google's gonna help
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.920]   in an expiration of Chrome with something,
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.520]   so it's been a while.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.920]   So much more-- - So much battery life
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:15.760]   do you need. - So much more battery life.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.240]   - I think that's a really nice, beautiful thing.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.560]   - And what if you dip in the screen?
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.160]   I mean, that should help you quite a bit.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.080]   - I don't see it.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.720]   - And it's bright red, come on, man.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.200]   - Yeah, I know, it's beautiful. - I love the color.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.880]   I have been-- - I have from some place
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.120]   to let you return it.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.360]   - There you go.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.080]   - Or, you know what, ask, send Kevin an email.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.200]   He's not watching today 'cause he stayed up late watching
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.600]   the election, but send him an email and be like,
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.920]   "Yo, would you buy this?"
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.480]   Or maybe he's already bought it.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:42.720]   - No, I don't think you're foolish at all,
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.280]   I think these are really nice.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:48.200]   Although, if I were you, if I were you, man,
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.880]   I'd wait 'til Tuesday when Apple announces its new MacBooks.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.080]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.400]   (laughing)
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.400]   - If battery life is what you want, you're gonna have--
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.960]   - Oh, I'm sooner gonna get the Raspberry Pi.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.080]   - That keyboard, is that not awesome?
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.520]   - Isn't that great? - That is so great.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.320]   It's sold out everywhere, but yes.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.080]   I was like, oh. - It is.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.920]   - It is a $70 keyboard that is--
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.960]   - That places are selling it for a hundred.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.680]   - Well, there's a $100 kit you can get
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.520]   with all the cabling and stuff.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.280]   - Oh, okay, that's awesome. - So if you have the cables,
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.280]   you don't need them and any geek will have the cables.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.600]   - I have the cables. - But this is--
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.920]   - I love the volume. - Yeah.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:28.600]   - This is so awesome, so cool.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.280]   It is a Raspberry Pi and it's the high end Raspberry Pi 4
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.440]   inside a keyboard, 70 bucks.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.360]   All you have to do is take the HDMI out,
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.960]   put it under your TV, power it.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.560]   Maybe if you wanna add a mouse
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.880]   and you've got a computer, a really good computer.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.120]   Now, a little caveat for people who maybe are thinking,
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.760]   I'll get this for the kids, they could do their classes.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.200]   Zoom and a camera, you can get 'em working,
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.960]   but it's gonna be a little challenge.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.680]   It's not, you're just as simple as plugging
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.560]   in a USB camera on this.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.280]   So if you're a geek, you could figure it out.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.800]   - Would you but it would work?
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.000]   - Yeah, Raspberry Pi has a camera module for it
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.640]   and you could plug it in, I bet it would work.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.040]   I can't get into it. - So you go app,
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:16.120]   get install. - Yeah, it's Linux.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.960]   But Zoom works on Linux.
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.840]   There's a web-based version of Zoom.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:25.320]   - It reminded me of Sinclair the old day of the old day.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.160]   - It is. - It is.
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.720]   - I know, I don't understand why audio's
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.960]   coming out of my computer.
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.280]   - I was like, what is playing music?
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.680]   - I completely lost control of--
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.760]   - So I'm playing Baby Shark in the background.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.240]   Now it will never stop playing Baby Shark.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.640]   (laughing)
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:40.640]   That's what it was.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.640]   (laughing)
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.080]   - No, it's not-- - His computer's haunted.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:47.760]   - Coming out of my phone.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.680]   I don't know why I started playing M&M criminal.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.920]   (laughing)
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.520]   Did somebody say something about criminal and M&M?
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.000]   I don't know.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.040]   I thought it sounded like M&M.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.760]   That was very strange.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.920]   - So random. - Very random.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:07.320]   - So I'm watching YouTube last night.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.000]   Like I said, I watched YouTube just as much
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.720]   as I watched regular television.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.320]   And Queen Peru was out there in the couch with me.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:19.320]   And I saw this pie announcement pop up and turned it on.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.240]   And I'm like, wow, that is so cool.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.640]   And I said, that's the same Raspberry Pi
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.280]   that we have upstairs before.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.280]   - The what?
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.800]   - I said, the computer. - The what?
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.720]   - Oh, see, are your boys using Raspberry Pi's?
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.320]   - No, I just, nobody touches it but me.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.400]   It's fun. - It's in there.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.760]   - You gotta keep a pie around the house
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.880]   in case you need to load some software
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:42.280]   and keep it as a web server or a little hub
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.600]   or say, you just gotta have a pie.
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.200]   - I do. I have a pie sitting on my desk ready to go.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.160]   - It's just a guest browser for us for the most part
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.800]   but it's there.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.560]   And I'm just explaining that, hey,
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.920]   it's that computer that we have upstairs
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.800]   but it's all in the keyboard.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.000]   And the face just went.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.160]   (laughing)
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.240]   - Yeah.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.920]   And why are you pointing this up to me?
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.280]   Why would I care?
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.440]   - It's like, why do I stay in there?
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.640]   - This is my life.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.680]   I sit there and I get really excited about something
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.520]   and I'm like, oh my God,
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.400]   the FCC is gonna release the spectrum
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.640]   and my husband is like, no.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.080]   (laughing)
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:18.960]   - And he's a geek.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.800]   That's the funny thing.
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:20.640]   He's not like--
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.920]   - He is not a geek.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:22.760]   - Oh, he's not?
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.600]   - He's sort of a geek.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.440]   - He's kind of a geek.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.280]   - He's not that kind of geek.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.880]   - Does he do the same thing about new top level domains?
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:28.720]   - Oh God, no.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.840]   He's like, no one wants to hear about that state.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:31.840]   - He knows better.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:36.840]   - Oh my God, they just released the .app TLD.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.760]   (laughing)
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.920]   I'm so excited.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.400]   - 70 bucks per night.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.160]   - Yeah. - That's awesome.
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.880]   - I know, I got excited about this
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.240]   and I was trying to explain it to him
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.440]   and he's like, do we need one of these?
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.640]   And I was like-- - Oh no.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.800]   - No. - But they're cool.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.680]   - Don't you want one?
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:55.240]   - It's an impulse price point, that's for sure.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.160]   - But you remember the one laptop per child?
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.800]   - I have one and the other one immediately.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.400]   - That was $100.
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.320]   - It was $100.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.480]   - It was kind of interesting, but you could do absolutely
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.160]   everything you would do with that
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.160]   and it's 10 times more powerful.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.480]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.720]   - Although to one laptop per child, that had a screen, right?
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.280]   - Yes, it came with everything.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:16.720]   It even came with wireless mesh networking.
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:19.200]   It was very interesting and it ran on
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.120]   a programming language called Scratch,
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.560]   which is basically a small talk.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.200]   So it was a very interesting,
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.840]   very, very interesting idea that did not take off.
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:34.960]   I have one because there was a buy one, buy two,
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.040]   give one to Africa or somewhere and--
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:39.880]   - Nice.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:42.680]   - It's a really interesting, it's historic.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.440]   But this pie has absolutely changed the world in ways
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.680]   that that was what OLPC was gonna do.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:51.760]   This pie is amazing.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.200]   And it's funny that you should say,
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.200]   it reminds you of the Commodore's and stuff,
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.520]   'cause really that was the inspiration
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.600]   as a BBC micro, like the Sinclair,
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.760]   these inexpensive computers that a whole generation
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.040]   in England grew up on.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:07.200]   And even up in the Raspberry Pi,
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.240]   people wanted, I interviewed them on triangulation.
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.880]   It's an old triangulation if you wanna watch the story.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.560]   But they wanted to create a computer
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.640]   that would empower the next generation of young people
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.080]   to learn computing.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.640]   It's really awesome.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.200]   I was running my Minecraft servers on that for a long time.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.160]   It's very, very powerful, very successful.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.960]   - I do wonder how many Raspberry Pi's
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.520]   are running Minecraft still.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.600]   - Well, you know, the distro that you can get with,
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.040]   one of the distros, I think it's Raspian,
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.480]   but one of the distros you can get with it,
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.080]   maybe it's a Windows distro,
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.160]   has a unique version of Minecraft
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:45.080]   that is Python scriptable.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:50.000]   So it's a really good tool for teaching young people
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.320]   into Minecraft had a program, 'cause all you have to say
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.800]   is, okay, now you're playing Minecraft,
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.120]   but did you know you could write a script
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:59.400]   that would just build a house with one push of the mouse?
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.120]   And then-- - The KNO did that.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.200]   I think that was the inside of the KNO computer for kids,
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.080]   'cause I got one of those from a,
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.440]   to try to get her into programming
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.440]   via the sneaky Minecraft way.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.880]   It didn't work that-- - Yeah.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.840]   - It was an attempt.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.120]   - You know what, it didn't work on my hard heads either.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.040]   - Yeah, not everybody should be programming, for sure.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.200]   But what you're doing is you're giving them the option
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.720]   that you're introducing it to them,
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.040]   and if it doesn't fit their needs,
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.440]   it doesn't fit their needs, that's fine.
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.280]   - Yeah.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.360]   - Yeah, I-- - The closest that I got to that
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.720]   is hard head, the senior hard head.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.440]   He's actually interested in mobile phones more and more
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.560]   over the last couple of years.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.160]   Like he really tends to look up to Mr. Howl,
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.160]   not just 'cause he's 6.8.9,
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.480]   but he tends to look up to his-- - He tends to look up
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.000]   to him because of his information
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   about all of the Android devices.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.400]   - Yeah, it's the Raspian version with Minecraft,
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:53.600]   and it has a plugin that comes with it,
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.640]   that allows you to--
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.160]   you can't actually do that.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.440]   You know, you can't do it on Windows.
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:02.980]   The Minecraft Pi Edition, it's really, really cool.
[01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:07.320]   One of the things you should do,
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:11.800]   you can programmatically build a bridge with Dynamite,
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.400]   and then as you walk over it,
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.880]   it blows up behind you all the way.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.880]   It's fantastic, kids love it.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:18.720]   - Nice.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.400]   (laughing)
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.760]   - It's like, okay.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.280]   - It's really cool.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.720]   I actually got that from a book that's all about learning
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.520]   Python using the Raspberry Pi.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.960]   It's really one of the best Python books out there.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:35.120]   So.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:36.680]   - A little update if you want it.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:37.520]   - Yeah.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.600]   - Python pulled within two or three thousand votes
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.120]   of Trump in Pennsylvania with more than 800,000 votes,
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:42.960]   you have to become it.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:43.800]   - Wow.
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.880]   Wow.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.440]   Yeah, this is, is this it?
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.800]   No, this isn't it.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.920]   I have it somewhere, Raspberry Pi.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.960]   - Every time I say Raspberry Pi,
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.480]   people respond to me with Pi whole.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.880]   - Well, that is the most common.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:04.360]   Yeah, absolutely the most common use for Raspberry Pi
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:07.240]   is a Pi whole, which is basically a router
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.200]   that blocks advertising and stuff.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:11.800]   - You think that's really the most common use?
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.960]   - Well, among his audience,
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.640]   every year, but yeah.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:19.280]   - I think a lot of my audience runs like a home bridge
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.280]   or open hand or something.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.120]   - Yeah.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:22.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.520]   - But I think most, I feel like there's a lot
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.880]   of Raspberry Pi based Minecraft servers out there.
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.480]   - Well, mine ran for a long time
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.840]   and then I thought, I need more power.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.880]   - No, I need this Pi.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.360]   I'm always like, take it.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:39.200]   I don't want to know.
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.040]   I don't want to buy another Pi.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.520]   - I have Pi's all over the place.
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.840]   There's a Pi set in front of me that's a music streamer.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:48.840]   - The PDP 11 in my office is actually a Pi DP 11.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.360]   - Oh, really? Yeah.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:53.520]   I have just one on my desk just as you said, Stacey.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:55.200]   You just waiting around for something, you know,
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:56.040]   if I ever need--
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:56.880]   - It's a project.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:57.720]   It's gonna need it.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:58.560]   - Yeah.
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:23:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.240]   It's just so cool.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.440]   It's so cool.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:06.640]   And Pi owned by a foundation started by
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.040]   a profit just open source period.
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:09.880]   - Right.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.720]   - And make them--
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.200]   - The chip inside is a Broadcom chip.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:16.200]   Broadcom developed the chip with Eben Eben Eben.
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.040]   - Eben?
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:17.880]   - Yeah.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.040]   - I've interviewed him like five times
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.120]   that I still can't get his name.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.600]   - He's so cool.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.440]   He's a--
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.280]   - He is so nice.
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.400]   - There's a guy who's made a huge difference.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.520]   Just step after step, just, you know,
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.920]   I'm gonna make this thing and it's just, it's wonderful.
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:35.080]   Yeah, the Raspberry Pi Foundation at RaspberryPi.org.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.120]   And they have a lot of resources for--
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.640]   - It's a little bit different than Arduino
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.720]   'cause they had like a split.
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.200]   Arduino was, you know, they--
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.240]   - Different computing board,
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.840]   less powerful, not a full computer,
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.120]   much more for embedded kind of stuff.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:54.960]   But, Mossimo developed that.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.080]   He ended up splitting with,
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.080]   was it the foundation or the company
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.400]   that makes the Arduino boards?
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.000]   And now there's like two versions of Arduino.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:04.840]   - Interesting.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.680]   - It's kind of sad.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.520]   That's a sad story.
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.840]   - Yeah.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.840]   Yeah, maybe that just is one more reason
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.160]   the Love Even and the Raspberry Pi Foundation
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.400]   'cause they've kept their original vision pure
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.600]   and they just continue to put out great things.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.760]   - Hey, how would you like to play some trumpets, John?
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.680]   'Cause I think it'd be good time to do the--
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:25.920]   - Gugo change now.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.920]   - Play the baby shark.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.840]   - Gugo change now.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:31.040]   - That's our new theme.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.640]   (gulping)
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:35.320]   Wouldn't that be a good theme?
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.160]   - Thank you.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.160]   I'm kind of joining you now, Leo.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.160]   I'm gonna get on this.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.000]   - Da da.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:42.920]   - Da da da.
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:44.440]   Da da da.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.440]   Google has announced,
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.560]   if you have Google One, do you know what Google One is?
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.400]   Yeah, you do.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.240]   Everybody listening to this show
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.280]   should know what Google One is, right?
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.280]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.080]   - It is, basically it's what the Google,
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.840]   the old Google Drive used to be.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.080]   - 'Cause Google has to rename,
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.960]   it doesn't kill, that's what you name.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:03.600]   - I was like, I don't know what Google One is
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:04.760]   and I'm on the show.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.720]   Oh no, but then when you said it, I'm like,
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:07.560]   "Oh, I do."
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.840]   They renamed it.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.840]   They are now, they are going to introduce
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.720]   as part of your bundle of features,
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.400]   a VPN by Google One.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.080]   Which does raise some interesting questions.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.160]   (laughing)
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.080]   Because of course, people often use VPNs
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.160]   to protect themselves against Google.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.000]   - Yeah.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.200]   - But Google says, "No, we're gonna protect,
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:31.840]   we're gonna protect your privacy,
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.160]   we're gonna protect your security."
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.440]   And actually, I trust them.
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.560]   I think that's probably the case,
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.560]   they probably do a good job.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.400]   So.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:42.840]   - Should we presume they won't be logging anything on this?
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.000]   - They say no logging,
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.400]   they also say we are open sourcing the client now,
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.560]   we will open source the server down the road
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.360]   so you can verify that in fact it's private.
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.960]   And I think it will be.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.760]   US only through the Google One app for Android,
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.680]   more regions coming soon, iOS, Windows and Mac
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.120]   also coming soon.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.760]   So it's not a complete solution yet.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.240]   Google One is two terabytes of storage
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.000]   for 10 bucks a month or a hundred bucks a year,
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.120]   I pay for it.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.440]   That's a good deal for storage.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.280]   - I did, yeah.
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:15.120]   - I did too.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.120]   - You get family support,
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.800]   there's you get premium support on Google stuff.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.640]   You get 10% on the Google Store and soon.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.800]   - You do?
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.720]   - Yeah, apparently.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:26.560]   Says so.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.400]   - Oh.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.720]   - I didn't know that either.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:29.560]   - Oh.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.360]   - It does say right here in the little fine print,
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.400]   right at the bottom.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.600]   Some minimum logging is performed to ensure quality of service
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.400]   but your network traffic is never logged
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:40.200]   and your IP is not associated to your traffic.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.080]   So.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:42.920]   - I trust them.
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:43.760]   No, you know what?
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.920]   Google's not gonna lie in their privacy statement,
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.320]   there's too much at risk for that.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.520]   And honestly, they don't need that information,
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.520]   they know everything.
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.360]   - They know everything, Joe.
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.200]   - I don't know.
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.360]   - I don't want to say that.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.880]   That's not where they're getting there.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.880]   They're actually, you have to--
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.920]   - Sure, privacy good.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.040]   - Privacy good.
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:05.480]   - Let me lock the door after they put cameras
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.080]   all inside your house.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.320]   You can't come in, but you're already there.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:10.320]   - This is the new California law,
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.920]   how many impact on this stuff?
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.800]   - The Proposition 24 stuff?
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.200]   - Yeah.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.240]   - It will let you correct data that's incorrect about you,
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.520]   which I don't think the original CCPA did.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.840]   It also is a little bit more fine-grained on the data
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.720]   it will collect.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:34.360]   So it lets you keep personal data safe.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.120]   It will be, Google will be affected
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.120]   'cause it only affects companies that have data
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.080]   on 100,000 households or more.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.520]   So Google definitely will be impacted by it.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:48.040]   I think the most interesting thing it does
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:52.200]   is set up a bureau to handle privacy complaints.
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.600]   And that's where I would expect for a lot of this stuff
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:56.360]   to be negotiated.
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.680]   I know that doesn't exactly answer your question, Jeff,
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.440]   so I'm sorry, but I can't think.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:03.280]   - Well, that's okay 'cause now I'm growling anyway.
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:04.800]   (growling)
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.640]   Guess what?
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.480]   Guess what?
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:10.920]   You're currently signed into your G Suite account.
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:14.920]   Switch to your personal Google account to upgrade.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.960]   If you want more storage for your G Suite account,
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:20.200]   visit Google Drive and FU.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.040]   - Well, and that is kind of complicated
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.200]   because there will be people who-
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:24.520]   - Wait, is it-
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:25.360]   - Go ahead.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   - Is it tribe or workplace?
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.200]   - What?
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.400]   - It's now workplace.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.520]   - It was G Suite.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.480]   It's drive hasn't changed, but it was G Suite.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:32.320]   - Well, drive hasn't changed.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.160]   - G Suite.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.320]   - And that's where we're having a update.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.400]   - We're having a update and everything.
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.760]   - And there's actually an article,
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.760]   now that you mentioned it on ZD,
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.840]   now what happens to your G Suite unlimited storage
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.800]   when Google moves you to workspace,
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.240]   I wanna go into all the nitty gritty details,
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:51.080]   but you can read this article if you are in that situation.
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.040]   - Sometimes, hey.
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.320]   - We use a G Suite business plan.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.160]   We have the $12 per user per month,
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:59.200]   and we get two terabytes of storage per user.
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.080]   That's not my phone.
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.080]   - All right, that was mine.
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.240]   - Who is trying to reach out?
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.000]   - Yeah, who would be calling?
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.520]   Who would be calling?
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.720]   - Spam, it's all so not as popular.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:17.160]   - Which, what was the most annoying election text messages?
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:20.240]   Who was the, who bugged you the most?
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.720]   - Harrison, J.B Harrison.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:25.240]   I don't even know why they had my information.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.680]   I got so-- - He lost.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:27.680]   - I know-- - He's a good guy.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:30.040]   He's a good guy and I wanted him to win, but he lost.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.640]   - I gave him money. - So I knew he was gonna bug me.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.480]   - Yeah, I gave him money too.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.360]   - He sent me 12 messages in a four-hour period.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:40.400]   - So mine was Mark Kelly from Arizona running--
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.480]   - Oh, I'm a good idiot, man.
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:42.320]   - The astronaut.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.160]   - The astronaut. - I would love
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.000]   to get a message from him.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.560]   - Yeah, but boy, you know, they acted like,
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:50.520]   it's funny how some campaigns are just very aggressive
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:51.440]   and fundraising.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.160]   For a while, I had somebody else's Sim, you know,
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:00.080]   I got a Sim that hadn't been cured properly
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.760]   and hadn't been left to dry.
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.760]   So I had, and this guy was apparently
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.400]   had donated to the Trump campaign.
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:09.640]   I have never seen more aggressive messages, I thought,
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:14.320]   you know, hey, right now we need $300, we'll double it.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.160]   Things like that.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.480]   Mark Kelly beat him.
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:17.640]   Mark Kelly was worse.
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.360]   It was, he won, by the way, Jamie did not.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.600]   Who was, did you get, who was your worst?
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.760]   'Cause I bet you, because I bet you donate
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.720]   to a lot of causes, Jeff, you got a lot of text messages.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:30.720]   - Oh, I did, I got tons.
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.880]   But also somebody, somebody signed me up for Trump too.
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:33.960]   So I was getting, I was getting--
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:34.960]   - Oh, isn't that sweet?
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:36.560]   - I'm throwing all those, yeah.
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:37.560]   - Oh, isn't that sweet?
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.040]   - Some listener I don't doubt.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.600]   - Yes, thank you.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:44.560]   So there's, give us and to take us away.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:46.080]   - And sorry.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.480]   - It was me, Jeff.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.440]   (laughing)
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.080]   - Show that, Travis.
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.080]   - Oh yeah, I'm signed up for--
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.360]   - I mean, like, let's get some moral panic in here.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.360]   - I'm signed up for everything.
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:57.360]   (laughing)
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:03.760]   - Oh, back to the change luck.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:07.040]   - So, anyway-- - Did you see, oh yeah.
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.280]   Did you see on the Pixel 5 that you could charge
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.560]   from your phone?
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.720]   - Reverse charging.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:13.840]   - Reverse charging.
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.000]   - Yeah, I thought that was kind of neat.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.200]   - Yeah, Samsung invented that.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.400]   Apple's doing, it supposedly has that capability
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:20.960]   but they haven't turned it on.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.120]   And yeah, I like that.
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.000]   Although, you know, I had it on my Samsung
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.880]   and when Samsung announced it, they said,
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:27.360]   "Look, you're on a train with somebody
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:28.760]   "and they could say, "Hey, can I borrow some power?
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.200]   "My headphones have died."
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:31.560]   I'm not giving you my phone.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.400]   - Oh no.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:33.880]   (laughing)
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.120]   - Okay, so I know that you might feel that way.
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:37.960]   - Yes.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:39.880]   - But like, as a journalist covering things,
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.240]   like when Kevin and I are sitting,
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:45.720]   sometimes life happens and you know you're gonna have
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:47.520]   the ability to charge later and you're like,
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.080]   "We gotta get this shit."
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.480]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.840]   And then you share power with the person.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.640]   - What is it about this show that makes people want to talk
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:57.120]   like they do in regular life?
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.200]   I don't understand that.
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.360]   - What are we all comfortable with when it happens?
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:03.280]   (laughing)
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:06.080]   - It's time now for the Scooter X change log
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.080]   'cause he always, during change log,
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.760]   he comes up with like 20 more things.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.360]   I'll just give you the headlines.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:16.080]   Google Assistant speakers and smart displays
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:19.520]   will not be able to make phone calls in the UK soon.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:24.000]   Google Voice now supports contact cards and text messages.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.760]   Who knows how long Google Voice messaging's gonna be around,
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.500]   but okay.
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:33.160]   Android Auto tweaks its Google Assistant UI again.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:36.600]   Maybe you've seen the new UI, but they're changing that.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:41.600]   Google Messages begins testing scheduled sending options.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:42.920]   Okay.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:48.200]   The key, you'll like this one, Jeff.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:51.760]   The key that replaces caps lock on your Chromebook
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.160]   is now called the everything button.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:58.080]   - Well, it used to be the, oh no, that's not the one.
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:59.080]   - What does that mean?
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.600]   - It just has a, it's just a dot, right?
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:06.280]   It's like a dot, but it doesn't do caps lock.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.400]   - Well, you can make it do caps lock.
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:08.840]   - You could.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:11.760]   The new branding for the, it's a multi-purpose button
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:12.880]   is what it is.
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:13.720]   That's why they call it.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:14.560]   - You can program it, it's always been the case.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.200]   - The everything button.
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:18.960]   - Oh, okay, I was like, no, it has to do something.
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:19.840]   What is it?
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:22.760]   - By default, I think it was the, no,
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:25.080]   I think by default it was the search.
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.000]   - It was the search button.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000]   - Yeah, it used to be the search button.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.760]   - The thing that really irritates me is the gosh darned,
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:31.800]   there for you, John.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.800]   Assistant button.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.760]   - Yes.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.000]   - I never use the system on my laptop.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.160]   - No, give me the back, give me the back.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.520]   So, all the time, I got rid of it.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.840]   - I know, I agree.
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.520]   We don't want an assistant button.
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.080]   - You're welcome to use this logo from now on.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.400]   (laughing)
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.360]   Everything, how many committee meetings?
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:51.200]   - Yeah, lots.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.720]   - To occur for this name.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.560]   - Yeah, what?
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:54.800]   - Let's start the everything button.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.760]   How ridiculous, you know what, behave Google?
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.000]   Google, I've been saying this many times.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.520]   You know what I want?
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:02.600]   I want multiple saved gets across the keyboard.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.040]   - Multiple saved gets, what does that mean?
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.680]   - I've talked about the show before,
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:11.400]   where I'm on a site and I want to save three quotes
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:15.000]   and a URL and then put them into the rundown.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000]   Rather than having to go on the fourth.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000]   - Oh, it's a cotton-pasting.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:17.840]   Okay.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:18.680]   - Yeah, come past it.
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.920]   - We used to call it, in the old newspaper CMS,
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:24.720]   we called them Save Get Keys.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:30.360]   And so, I can say, this paragraph is saved one.
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:31.400]   This paragraph is saved two.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.600]   This URL is saved three.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:33.800]   Then I go to the other place,
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:36.920]   and I put in Save One, Save Get 123.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.440]   - Is that essentially a clipboard manager?
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.280]   - Yeah.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.120]   - It is.
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.760]   - It, we talked about this once before,
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.720]   and I got somebody told me a program to use,
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:47.240]   and I love it, so thank you.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:51.920]   Hey, Nest, thermostats can now
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.120]   anticipate problems with your HVAC system.
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:54.960]   - Whoa, whoa.
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.800]   - Like, what do you mean problems?
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:00.800]   Like, usually before your HVAC system breaks,
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.880]   it experiences a period of maybe straining extra hard
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.840]   to keep your house cool, or, you know,
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:10.840]   it experiences some sort of problem
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:13.680]   that can be determined, like your thermostat
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:17.600]   can actually say, hey, we've got the temperature set to 68,
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.720]   and your HVAC has been running for eight hours,
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:22.840]   normally it only runs for two hours.
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:25.440]   And then it's like, I think there might be a problem,
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.120]   but it's alert, the owner of the house, and it does.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.520]   And that's cool.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:31.400]   - That's good stuff.
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:35.000]   - Does it sound like this when it does it?
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.800]   - Have you been doing some more work?
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:39.960]   - Here's sketches.
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.280]   - May I see them?
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.120]   - Sure.
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.440]   - Was that, are you ID?
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.720]   - This is how my--
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.600]   - That's a very nice rendering, Dave.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:49.760]   - Thank you, Dave.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.480]   - I think you've improved a great deal.
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:53.440]   - Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.760]   - And you hold it a bit closer.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.760]   - Each HVAC system is about to go out.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:58.600]   Uh-oh.
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.240]   - That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:01.080]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:03.760]   - Yes.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:04.600]   - By the way.
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.480]   - Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:10.600]   - No, never.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:14.280]   - Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.680]   - But what?
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:17.760]   - But during the past few weeks,
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:20.400]   I've wondered whether you might be having some second thought.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.400]   - Never mind, never mind, never mind.
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.640]   There was a--
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.720]   - But like, where are we going with this?
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:27.200]   - 'Cause eventually he's gonna say,
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:29.080]   "Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:31.800]   The unit is about to fail, and I thought it'd be nice
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:35.200]   if my nest thermostat would sound like that.
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:36.040]   But it's a very long clip."
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:37.400]   - I don't think that would be nice at all.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:38.240]   - No.
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.480]   (laughing)
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.680]   - I think it would be kind of creepy
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:43.200]   if my nest thermostat sounded like,
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:44.720]   "Nope, out of the wall."
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.800]   - Yeah, really.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:46.960]   - Good.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.760]   - Hello, Stacey.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:52.080]   I see the HVAC unit is about to fail.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:54.760]   Would you like to put on your space suit and fix it?
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.640]   (laughing)
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:57.780]   I promise I'll let you back in.
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:04.560]   - Google Play Music, gone too soon.
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.660]   It's dead now.
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:08.160]   It's dead, Jim.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.200]   Born in 2011, shut down last week.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:14.500]   Wired says, "Shall live forever in our hearts."
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:18.800]   - You wanna know what I'm listening to in my new YouTube music?
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.120]   - What?
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:22.040]   - Big, short box set.
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:23.840]   - Oh, a new one?
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.480]   - Early, early, early mission.
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.320]   - Oh, it's like that.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.160]   - It's eerial and beautiful.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.840]   It's amazing.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.480]   - She had an amazing voice.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.800]   And didn't she tune her hammer Dalsamirt too?
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.640]   - An active hire or something.
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:37.400]   She had some odd tuning she used.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:40.600]   - Yeah, she remembered for every song she retuned.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:41.440]   - Wow.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:42.280]   - Amazing.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:43.120]   - Amazing.
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:43.960]   - It's lovely.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:44.960]   I'm gonna walk in with it.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:47.440]   - Is it the songs we all know or?
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:50.560]   - Yeah, well, it starts off very folky
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.960]   'cause this is her very young sort of voice is really high
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.320]   and an almost child like at the beginning.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.560]   - Yeah.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.760]   Yeah, so she had open tuning for every song
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:01.440]   was a different tuning.
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:04.360]   - Yeah, it seems like problematic.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.560]   I guess she didn't want anybody to cover her.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.400]   - She was good.
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:08.240]   - Cover her songs.
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.160]   Yeah, oh, I love that.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.040]   - That's an artist.
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:10.880]   - Yeah.
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:11.720]   So there's a--
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:14.400]   - So this is, you know, so you love Joni Mitchell.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:15.640]   She's still around.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:17.200]   She deserves some money.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.680]   You're gonna give her like a tenth of a cent
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:20.880]   every time you play a song
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.880]   or you're gonna buy the box set.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:28.080]   But the problem is I play it on watch.
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:28.920]   - Right.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:29.760]   - Yeah.
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:32.840]   - And you can stream it freely with that.
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:35.120]   - 'Cause it Mike Schmidt,
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:36.040]   'cause I now do, of course,
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.160]   by Ray Biscayford and stuff,
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.840]   Mike Schmidt, NYT.
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:39.680]   - Yeah.
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:42.160]   - He had two shells behind him
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.480]   with the neatest, ridiculous,
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:49.240]   so I tweeted it, it was nothing but a long run of CDs
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:50.400]   or AOL-dest-
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.240]   - Wow.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:52.480]   - Which are amazing.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.960]   You know, so it's a lot of CDs.
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.400]   - Wow.
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:56.920]   - They probably don't work anymore.
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.920]   I mean, CDs are not like the most long lived option out there.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.920]   - Poor Joni Mitchell, she opens her faults
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.640]   and Jeff just streams it.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:08.400]   Man.
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:09.240]   Man.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.800]   - I know.
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:12.640]   - You could get a four.
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:13.480]   - What would I play with?
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:14.800]   I was debating, but I don't know.
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.640]   - I know.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.040]   I know, I understand.
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.440]   - My dad just went nuts and bought a record player
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:25.160]   and a new receiver and other things.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.400]   He just went crazy.
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:31.200]   So you could do, you could pull it, Don Higgins.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.400]   - Did your mom say why?
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:37.800]   - No, I think my mom is totally just like,
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:40.440]   yes, when the man, you know, needs a hobby,
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:41.760]   he gets a hobby.
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.080]   His current hobby is this.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:48.080]   - He might be interested in the 180 gram vinyl version
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:50.240]   of early Joni 1963,
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:54.120]   featuring the nine song CFQ/CAM performance
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:57.680]   in Saskatoon's sketch one in 1963.
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:01.320]   - I'm gonna say my dad is not a Joni Mitchell fan.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.160]   - Oh, okay.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:09.120]   - My mom is, and I remember him saying bad things about her.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.520]   (gasping)
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:14.680]   - She's saying so high it hurts my ears.
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:20.520]   - He's more of a, he's more of a CCR, Eric Clapton.
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:24.520]   - I don't care, you still just appreciate Joni.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:27.480]   - Oh. - I don't think he does.
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:30.680]   - So it has 119 cuts.
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:31.720]   - Oh, wow.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:34.640]   So you're just streaming it on YouTube music.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:36.720]   - Yeah, I don't love it.
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:38.320]   - I feel guilty, I really do.
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.200]   I don't, I pay for Google Music.
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.040]   - No, I didn't know what to do.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:49.680]   - They paved Paradise and started streaming my box set.
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:51.360]   - Thank you.
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.680]   - Yo, yo.
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.200]   What?
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.720]   - I'm sorry, I just got excited.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:03.600]   This has nothing to do with tech, you just ignore me.
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.680]   - Go ahead.
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:05.680]   - I'm too late now.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:08.280]   - You can't do that and not tell us what you're all excited about.
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:11.680]   - I was updating the New York Times to check in on the election,
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:15.760]   as one does, and they had a food article up there.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.920]   I don't go back to the-- - What the fuck was the election?
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:19.640]   You're all, it was a-- - No, the election.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:22.840]   - It's the same way it's been. - Did you get Julia Child's
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.040]   tuna salad recipe?
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:24.880]   Is that what you got?
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:26.760]   - No, no, this is so brilliant.
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:27.880]   I can't believe I didn't think about it.
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:28.800]   It's so easy.
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:32.120]   Rice crispy treats with chocolate and pretzels.
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.880]   - Oh Lord, that'll kill you.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.480]   - Y'all, no, that's brilliant.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:37.600]   You get the salt?
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.880]   - Salt and salt. - And the sweet.
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:40.400]   - And the sweet.
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:41.240]   - Nailed it. - Oh.
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.080]   - I need some peanut butter.
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.760]   - I can't even believe I've never thought of this.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:45.680]   It'd be so easy.
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:46.520]   - Nailed it.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:47.600]   - Oh. - Oh.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.680]   - Okay.
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:51.960]   - Do you crush the pretzel with the Rice Krispies
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.000]   and mix it all in together?
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.280]   Is that the idea?
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:55.400]   - I think so.
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.280]   I didn't read the recipe 'cause I got so excited
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:59.280]   and I'm supposed to be paying attention to y'all.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:00.600]   So I stopped.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:02.440]   I just got, I got so sidetracked.
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.280]   I'm so sorry.
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:04.120]   - No, I don't blame you.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.080]   - Never, ever do that.
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:10.080]   I always pay 100% attention to what is happening
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:10.920]   on this podcast.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:11.760]   - So who's winning right now?
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.120]   - I don't tweet.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.120]   I don't look anything up.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:14.960]   - So what's the current?
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:15.960]   - I just give my--
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:16.800]   - That's the current vote.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:17.640]   - The whole attention.
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:18.480]   - I'm leaving y'all.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:20.520]   (laughing)
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:23.600]   - He's up for, he's still basically the same.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.440]   - I don't like letters.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:25.280]   I don't like letters.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.040]   - I got last week they had a grid article
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.760]   about Julia Child's favorite lunch,
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:31.760]   which was tuna fish.
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:32.600]   - Pop it, yes.
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:37.600]   - Yes, with a tomato onion, but they threw me.
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:40.720]   They said, it's gotta be Hellman's mayonnaise.
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:42.440]   Well, we have that, but it's called best foods out here,
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:43.480]   but we have that.
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:45.080]   It's gotta be Hellman's mayonnaise.
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:48.200]   It has to be Bayes English muffins.
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:51.040]   And I said, Bayes, what's Bayes?
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:52.320]   What's Bayes English muffins?
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:55.720]   I've been eating Thomas's English muffins my whole life.
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:56.720]   - Oh, two.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.960]   - Well, so I went on Amazon and I ordered,
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:02.320]   I got a case of Bayes English muffins.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.160]   - So it was a case.
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.640]   - A case?
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:06.480]   - A case.
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:07.320]   - Oh my god.
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:08.320]   - I didn't know how many it was getting.
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:11.480]   I got 300 English muffins in my freezer.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.960]   (laughing)
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:15.760]   - They're good though.
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:17.040]   - Are they better than Thomas's?
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.520]   - Yes.
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:19.360]   - Okay, great.
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.160]   - They're going to be just having a...
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:23.520]   - I gotta figure out a way to get into your...
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:27.200]   - Yeah, my house, see, so on Instagram and whatever.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:28.680]   Wherever else you're watching ads,
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:29.920]   'cause they are hooking you.
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:30.760]   - This wasn't an ad.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:34.440]   This was a New York Times article about Julian Child.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:37.560]   And it mentions specifically that that...
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.360]   - But it just got into your syllable, man.
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:40.200]   - But she would only accept Bayes.
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:41.120]   Yeah, it was a blurb.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:43.400]   - Bayes English muffins.
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:44.760]   - Was she making sandwich of it?
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.600]   - Nope, open face.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:47.360]   - Open face, okay.
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:48.520]   - All right, but you'd have two,
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:49.520]   'cause there's English muffins,
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.520]   that's two sides of your open up.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.680]   Tuna and capers, lemon juice,
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.960]   Hellman's mayonnaise, red onion,
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:58.720]   and a slice of red onion on top.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:01.760]   Now I'm really getting hungry.
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:02.600]   (laughing)
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:03.520]   - Yeah, I am too.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.480]   I was really hoping that Google didn't put those virtual
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:08.040]   backgrounds into the...
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.280]   - Oh, they did.
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:10.720]   Aren't you glad that they did?
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:13.760]   - Google Meet will now let you use, thank you, Anne.
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.200]   - Don't bring it us back, Anne.
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:17.760]   - Good, real or so good.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.240]   Google Meet will now let you use custom...
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:21.840]   I still haven't had Popeyes though.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:22.680]   So I just...
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:23.760]   (laughing)
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:25.640]   - Sandwich, get the sandwich, get the sandwich.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.200]   Telling you, get the sandwich.
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:29.720]   - I thought I was gonna leave the show last time,
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:31.680]   last week, and just go straight to Popeyes,
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:33.360]   but then I thought better of it.
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:37.280]   Google Meet will now let you use custom backgrounds
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:41.320]   on video cards, it's not yet available on video calls.
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:44.520]   It's not yet available for mobile users, but...
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.760]   Yeah, I hate those custom backgrounds,
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:47.760]   I hate the blur background.
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.240]   - Not a fan of them.
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.680]   - 'Cause they don't do a good key, let's face it.
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:59.160]   I mentioned I was watching former CDC director,
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:02.080]   he had a key background, 'cause I guess he...
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:04.080]   It looked like his office, his bookshelf,
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:05.360]   he didn't want you to know he was in his kitchen,
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:06.680]   but every time he moved his head,
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:08.720]   you could see his kitchen through the whole...
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:09.560]   - Yeah, no.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:11.720]   - Stop it.
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:13.320]   - And don't get me wrong,
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:17.480]   I give the developers credit for pulling that off
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:20.160]   on pretty much any type of device or whatever,
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:24.080]   but it's not necessary people, it's not.
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:27.640]   Just go with a, I don't know, just move your room.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:29.160]   - Yeah, move your room.
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:33.640]   - Do what Antas go down, get a go to Michael's art supplies.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:36.360]   - $10, he had a $10 background paper.
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:37.360]   - Yeah.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.680]   - Well, I mean, if you have to take a call,
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:41.680]   you're like, "Oh crap, I forgot this meeting."
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.160]   And you've got to take it,
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:46.040]   having a virtual background can be kind of nice.
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:47.240]   - Yeah, but you're...
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:48.240]   - Let's go from students.
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.680]   - You have a beautiful office,
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:51.520]   'cause you're doing it...
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.320]   - But I'm not sitting in it non-stop.
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.160]   - Oh, I see.
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:56.720]   - And sometimes, I'll be out walking the dog
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:59.600]   and I'll suddenly be like, (gasps)
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.000]   there's Zoom o'clock.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:01.840]   - Okay.
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:04.920]   - But are we to the point now,
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:08.440]   considering this is November 2020,
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:13.320]   where it's, I guess it's expected that people's meetings
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.280]   aren't going to always be in an ideal or perfect location
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:20.080]   because life has changed pretty dramatically for everybody.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.200]   So are we poo-pooing on people because they...
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:29.200]   Not in a beautiful office or studio or something like that.
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:30.120]   It's okay to be a different...
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:32.240]   - No, but what if your sink is full of dirty dishes?
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:33.080]   - Yeah.
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:33.920]   - And you don't want to admit that.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:35.520]   - What if your bed's not me?
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:36.640]   - Yeah.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:37.960]   - Well, how do you say it with your students?
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:38.800]   - My mom...
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.120]   - What if their family's behind them
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.880]   and the family doesn't really want to be on...
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:42.720]   - Right.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.520]   - And they don't really want to show their family.
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:46.000]   And I have one colleague whose husband
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.520]   walked by it on their way.
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:51.240]   - Yeah, I do that all the time to at least his cause.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:52.320]   - That's fair.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.360]   - That's not going to get a sponsorship revenue.
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:55.200]   - I know.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:56.040]   - I'm just saying...
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:56.880]   - On your way to the hot tub.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.280]   - Well, first the neighbor.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:02.600]   Her desk is right in the living room, but it's like...
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:06.560]   I'd actually have to like go outside and around to avoid
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.120]   being on the Zoom call.
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:10.680]   What did you...
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:11.400]   You said your mom...
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.760]   - Sacy?
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:14.600]   - His mom.
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:15.440]   - You said my mom.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:17.280]   Maybe that was just a...
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:18.920]   - That was just like a Freudian slip.
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:19.760]   I guess my mom.
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.600]   - My mom.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:21.440]   - My mom.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:22.280]   My mom.
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:23.640]   - I'm thinking about my mom.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:24.480]   - My mom.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.760]   - I don't know.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.400]   - Voice typing is about to get a lot better
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:32.040]   if you use Google's Gboard keyboard,
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:35.200]   which everybody on Pixel's probably does.
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:38.000]   Maybe people who are using Samsung and other devices
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.160]   download it and use it.
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.720]   It's a pretty good keyboard.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:43.360]   Pixel owners are starting to see Gboards
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:46.280]   with new enhanced voice typing experience.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:49.440]   Automatic punctuation.
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:51.160]   Not everybody will have this.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:54.560]   You can access it by typing the microphone icon
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:56.120]   on the Gboard.
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:59.720]   The transcription you'll notice is noticeably faster.
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.720]   And the voice typing function now lets you say
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:04.040]   things like clear to...
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:05.480]   This is a big improvement.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:09.960]   To delete whatever you just typed, like clear.
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:10.800]   You'll also...
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:11.640]   - You're back to when?
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.600]   How far back was it?
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:14.720]   - The whole thing.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:16.280]   Startovers. - Oh, geez.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:18.880]   - But remember when we had like dragon naturally speaking
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:20.520]   in the other dictation tools,
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:23.000]   they had all sorts of editing commands.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:23.960]   I mean, they needed them,
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:26.120]   but it was really a lot easier than,
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:27.840]   oh, now I gotta do this.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:30.520]   Auto punctuation intelligently predicts
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:32.920]   where the period comma or question mark will go
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.240]   while you're dictating.
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:36.280]   - So you don't have to. - So you don't have to.
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:37.560]   - It's amazing 'cause I'm terrible at commas.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:38.640]   - Right, you don't have to say.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.480]   - My editors hate me.
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:40.320]   - Comiting me.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.600]   Now, here's a question you use too many or too few.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:46.880]   - The accusation has been leveled
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:50.520]   that I randomly sprinkle commas throughout my copy.
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:51.360]   - Poor fun.
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:53.480]   - Yeah, that's what my English teacher used to call
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:54.640]   comma blunder.
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:56.760]   - Yeah.
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:49:58.360]   - You're a comma blunderer.
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:01.760]   I blunder my way through the English language when I write.
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:03.320]   But that's my thing.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:06.440]   And I try really, even when I try, I do it wrong.
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:07.560]   So I've stopped trying.
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:13.440]   - I actually really enjoy the precise use of punctuation
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:14.760]   when I run. - Mm-hmm.
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:15.600]   - So why?
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:17.600]   - The choice of semicolons versus colons.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:18.440]   - Yes.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.120]   - When to use a wonderful thing.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:21.360]   - Oh, I love a semicolon.
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:24.640]   And you really, I'm sorry.
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.000]   - I overused dashes.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.200]   - I love the M-dash.
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:29.640]   But Strunk and White said it's strong.
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.080]   Use the M-dash.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:35.080]   But then I've been told since then,
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:37.360]   oh, you shouldn't follow Strunk and White.
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.760]   That's no longer considered good usage.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.320]   - I just don't use your exclamation point as a crutch.
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:44.160]   - Oh, I do.
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:45.280]   Lots.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:46.800]   But only in texting and emails.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.560]   But I find myself-- - So I knew someone
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.120]   who said she dated a guy from Yale,
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:54.920]   did I say this before, who said to her that his rule was,
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:58.560]   in life, you can use three exclamation marks.
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:00.120]   - In life. - They already used one.
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:02.840]   - What a lovely, unfun person.
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:04.280]   - I'm just sorry.
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:07.480]   I've already used one exclamation mark
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:09.600]   and I'd like to save one for next year.
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:12.840]   She's gonna get very excited.
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:14.920]   - Oh, y'all are gonna love this.
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:16.400]   I can't wait 'til we get to our thing.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:17.520]   It's gonna be so much fun.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:18.560]   - Good.
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:19.880]   - That's-- - That's fun.
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:20.720]   - Is that a hint? - Is that a hint?
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:21.920]   - Is that a hint? - Is that a hint?
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:23.800]   - That's-- - No, I'm just really excited.
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:27.320]   - Okay, that's the Google change law.
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:30.160]   Before you get to the thing,
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:31.920]   I got one question for you. - Yes.
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:36.720]   - The story about Google
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:40.560]   at a standard for mobile driver's licenses.
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:41.840]   - Oh.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.440]   - Did you see this one? - No.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:44.840]   - It's one of those things where you guys
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:47.760]   are so good at thinking through all this security stuff.
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:50.920]   So you have your driver's license on your phone
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:51.920]   instead of in your pocket.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:53.840]   And it has a whole system for verification.
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:56.880]   So it's not that long, just read down, you'll see.
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:59.040]   And I'm curious if you think this passes the smell test.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:01.800]   I'm sure it does, but I just, I couldn't figure it out.
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:06.600]   - It's an ISO standard. - Yes.
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:09.680]   - ISO 18013-5.
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:13.520]   It's been written by a diverse group of people
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:17.160]   representing drivers license issuers
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:19.160]   like the state governments in the US,
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:22.360]   relying partners, parties like federal state government,
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:24.840]   including law enforcement, academia, industry,
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:27.000]   including Google and many others.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.080]   It allows for the construction of an MDL
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:31.720]   mobile driving license application
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:32.800]   you can carry on your phone.
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:34.320]   I'm all for it.
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.000]   Instead of handing over your plastic card,
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.240]   you open the application on your phone,
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:41.200]   press a button to share your MDL.
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.560]   The verifier has their own device with the,
[01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:46.920]   oh, see the officer has to carry a special device
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:48.400]   with an MDL reader. - Oh, that's so good.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:52.920]   - And they scan the QR code or do an NFC tap.
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:57.720]   Now, the transfer is well done.
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:00.840]   There's a crypto, ephemeral cryptographic public key.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:03.880]   It's kind of like an Apple Pay transfer
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:06.720]   and a hardware address the MDL reader can connect to.
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:08.520]   Once it obtains the crypto key,
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.240]   it creates its own ephemeral key pair,
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:14.200]   establishes an encrypted and authenticated Bluetooth LE,
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:18.120]   Wi-Fi aware or NFC channel to request the data
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:20.720]   such as portrait image or what kinds of vehicles
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:22.160]   you're allowed to drive also could be used
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.840]   to ask more abstract questions,
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.040]   such as is the holder older than 18.
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:28.360]   So presumably as you go into a bar,
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:30.040]   they'd have a reader, you just hold it out.
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.320]   - Oh, 18. - Oh, 18.
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:33.600]   - Yeah, no more fake IDs.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.280]   - No more fake IDs.
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:36.120]   - Well, you carry your friends.
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:38.800]   - Well, no, actually you just carry your friend's phone.
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.120]   But no one would let their phone out of their hands
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:43.160]   for that long. - It does make the phone,
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:44.880]   this is the problem somewhat,
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:47.400]   makes the phone more...
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:52.080]   - Oh, I like this.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:55.840]   So it says like a bartender who wants to check your ID,
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:58.080]   they only need to get one piece of information.
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:00.480]   So that means they wouldn't see where your address is,
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:03.280]   which is actually really useful for...
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:04.600]   - Yes, it is. - Yes, bouncers
[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:06.080]   hit on me all the time.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.640]   I always find them at my door.
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:12.440]   No, that's probably true, not for me, obviously.
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:14.040]   - Oh, I was like, really?
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:15.400]   (laughing)
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:16.960]   - I don't think you love me.
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.800]   That's really interesting.
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:20.640]   - I thought it was interesting,
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:22.680]   so that makes sense, huh?
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:24.400]   - One advantage of plastic cards,
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:28.560]   they don't require power or network communication.
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:30.720]   I would bet for a long time there'd be an interim
[01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:32.640]   where you'd have to carry bows.
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:33.880]   - Yeah, I would imagine. - Yeah.
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:34.800]   - Of course.
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:38.680]   But ultimately, don't you think that the phone will become,
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:41.600]   you're identifying, because of...
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:42.960]   - It's your wallet? - It's your wallet, yeah.
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:47.960]   Because of biometrics, that's kind of a sci-fi future
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.880]   where you have this thing that is your identity card.
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:53.240]   It's you, everything. - You move from
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:57.440]   I think there before I am, I have a phone there before I am.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:00.200]   - Yeah, I NFC there before I am.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:02.240]   - It's your wallet right now.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:03.080]   - It is.
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:05.120]   Especially during quarantine,
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:08.840]   I never touch terminals anymore.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:12.040]   I just press, hold my Apple watch over the terminal.
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:14.120]   - Well, it's interesting for,
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:16.480]   like when you check into a hotel, for example,
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:18.040]   they wanna see your credit card unlicensed.
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:20.080]   If you have all of that on your phone,
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:22.840]   you could actually do all of that just by scanning,
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:24.680]   instead of having the stupid mobile app
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:26.680]   on your 18 different hotels.
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:30.520]   - And then use the phone to open the door.
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:31.360]   - Right.
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:34.400]   - There's some privacy concerns,
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:35.840]   but I think it could be thought out well.
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:38.000]   And I do love it that in some ways
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.640]   it's privacy protecting,
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:41.960]   'cause you could say, just tell 'em I age, nothing else.
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:43.160]   - I like that.
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:44.000]   - I like that.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.400]   - Just give 'em the information they need at this point.
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:48.400]   - It does make it the point.
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:51.040]   - But the weakness is that it presumes that
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:53.200]   you are your phone and your phone is you.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:54.120]   - Yes.
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:55.760]   - Right.
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:57.400]   - If you stole something's phone.
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:59.440]   - Right.
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:01.040]   You'd have access to this,
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:02.760]   so it'd have to be easy to get rid of.
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:05.000]   But if you steal someone's wallet,
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.760]   it's, I mean, like, we have a similar weakness
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:09.000]   with our wallets,
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.600]   although we don't tend to take our wallets out
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.000]   and leave them on the table at restaurants
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.880]   so you could check text messages.
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:14.880]   So.
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:15.720]   - True.
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:19.280]   Eventually you're writing the O it'll be your blob.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:20.120]   - You're your blob,
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:21.480]   that's the blob we were talking about.
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:23.840]   Yeah, I forgot about that, that's the blob.
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:25.080]   - How could you forget about the blob?
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:26.000]   - I forgot the blob.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.600]   - Yeah.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:28.960]   - All right, thank you, that was interesting.
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:31.320]   - Oh, it's a good, thank you.
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:32.320]   - Good story.
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:33.160]   - You're right.
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:37.280]   - Jeff is fascinating.
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:40.120]   - You were, Jeff, you really take this show very seriously.
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:43.200]   - I do, I put lots of stuff,
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:44.720]   pardon me, in the rundown.
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:48.080]   Mainly so I can steer you all away from the stories
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:49.080]   I don't want to talk about.
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:52.120]   - Like Walmart abandoning the plan to have robots,
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:54.480]   check story inventories.
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.320]   - No, I didn't.
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:56.160]   - They're keeping some of their robots,
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:58.280]   but they got rid of the Boston over robots,
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:00.240]   which makes me sad 'cause I like to envision,
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.040]   I like to envision Boston over robots
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:03.640]   that are actually doing the Boston over robots.
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:04.480]   - Dance.
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:05.480]   - Or dance into the Boston.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:07.760]   - It's funny 'cause depending on your angle,
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:11.440]   like in gadgets says, oh, humans are back,
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:12.920]   then like Mother Jones would say,
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:15.840]   to enslave their workers.
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:19.000]   It's like, they really, I have to admit,
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.200]   doing inventory in a story is one of the worst jobs.
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:23.040]   - It sucks.
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:23.880]   - Yeah.
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.840]   So this bot just walks,
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.040]   rolls down the aisle and goes,
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:27.880]   "Faster."
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:29.720]   - Faster.
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:30.720]   - The only thing that came to my mind is--
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:31.880]   - But it's not faster than it could be.
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:32.880]   - It costs. - Right.
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:36.560]   What did it cost to have these robots in place?
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:40.120]   And what did it cost to support and maintain them?
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:41.560]   Is that something that they looked at to say,
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:44.240]   okay, we're gonna spend the X amount of dollars in this,
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:47.040]   and it's probably cheaper, just to pay to humans?
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.120]   You think that was it?
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:49.680]   - Walmart found-- - Especially if you don't have
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:50.880]   to pay 'em health insurance.
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:51.720]   - Yeah.
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:52.560]   - There you go.
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:55.160]   - Walmart found that workers collecting online deliveries
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:58.920]   from shelves, you know, pickers could also
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.360]   gather inventory data.
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:01.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:02.560]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:05.200]   - Now Walmart plans to use those folks to monitor levels
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:08.760]   and locations, which makes the robots redundant.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:12.240]   Also, the CEO of Walmart was concerned about how shoppers
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:15.400]   might react and interact with robots in stores.
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:19.200]   - Oh, I have a story about this coming out
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:20.760]   in a couple of weeks at IEEE.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:25.760]   It's all about how we as humans react to robots
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:28.440]   and how we need a registry for robots.
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:31.640]   Because as people, when you encounter these things,
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:32.960]   you're like, well, who owns it?
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:34.040]   What's it doing?
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.800]   And we need a place to look that up.
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:36.760]   It's gonna be a good story.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:38.080]   Y'all will like it. - That's really interesting, yeah.
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:38.920]   - Yeah.
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:41.060]   That is quite interesting.
[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:43.840]   Do we care about the, we don't,
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:46.160]   the Glenn Greenwald intercepts?
[01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:47.520]   - No, we want to break the line.
[01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:49.200]   - No. - No.
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:50.200]   - What a great line.
[01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:55.520]   We respect the journalist that Greg Learwald was.
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:57.040]   - Oh, ow.
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:58.240]   - Oh, it was sing.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:58:59.240]   - Oh, yeah, no, it was sing.
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:01.960]   - They think the back, that was all.
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:05.760]   I bet you you put this story in from Slate Americans
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:08.940]   are too worried about political misinformation.
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:11.880]   Tell me, what does that mean?
[01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:13.200]   Why?
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:15.400]   - It's just as that.
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:16.800]   - Is a survey.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:20.120]   Gallup poll says four in five Americans are concerned.
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:22.000]   - They're less concerned than they, yeah.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.920]   - That misinformation will sway the outcome of the election.
[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:30.520]   80%, either very or somewhat concerned.
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:32.280]   - Right, so we're saying we shouldn't be less concerned
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:33.680]   than the people we got. - Though I've seen a study
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:36.120]   that said that the influence of Twitter and Facebook
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:39.160]   was nothing compared to the influence of Fox News.
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:41.000]   - Exactly, that's what it says.
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.560]   - That's the, that's the real.
[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:45.760]   - That's the real. - Our moral panic straight.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:46.600]   - Yeah.
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:51.280]   - You want to see this data visualization
[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:53.560]   of the spread of COVID?
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:56.000]   - I thought it was really good.
[01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.760]   - Yeah. - It was from L-Pays.
[01:59:57.760 --> 01:59:59.560]   - This is what we're learning now
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:01.640]   is that it's really aerosolized.
[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:03.920]   It comes through the air.
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:06.640]   And so this is a very kind of a graphical,
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:09.400]   just from the Spanish, it's a Spanish newspaper, right?
[02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:11.400]   - L-Pays, yeah. - L-Pays.
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:13.000]   Six people get together in a private home,
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.800]   one of whom is infected.
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:15.960]   This is, by the way, this is your--
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:18.840]   - They're being very relaxed about it in the graphic.
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:21.080]   - He's infected, but he does not feel in any pain.
[02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:23.480]   - No, no, no, he's quite relaxed on the--
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:26.560]   - This Thanksgiving. - Yes, he has that attitude.
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:29.520]   This would be the guy who's infected and affects you.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:34.520]   About 31% of coronavirus outbreaks in Spain are caused by this guy.
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:38.800]   (both laughing)
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:40.400]   So after four-- - You got that.
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:41.880]   - Okay, so-- - Oh, they're all red now.
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:43.360]   - It's noon, right?
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:47.680]   But now at 1,604 PM, four hours later,
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:49.760]   doesn't matter if safe distances,
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:52.120]   if you spend four hours together talking loudly
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:56.800]   at that wearing a face mask in a room with zero ventilation,
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:58.600]   five of them will become infected
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:00.520]   according to the scientific model.
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:05.520]   If face masks are worn, four are at risk.
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:08.920]   Masks alone will not prevent the infection
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:10.720]   in such a prolonged exposure,
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:12.920]   I mean, four hours is a long time.
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:17.920]   However, however, the risk of infection drops to below one
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:20.640]   when the group uses face masks,
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:23.520]   shortens the length of the gathering to two hours
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:26.000]   and ventilates.
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.760]   That's really the key.
[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:29.720]   - It makes total sense though.
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:32.920]   - I worked out with my trainer, he has an open barn.
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:34.880]   And so it's sort of outside, I said,
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:38.280]   all you have to do is put a fan in that window,
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:41.400]   just a slow fan either pulling or blowing,
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:42.920]   to keep the air moving.
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:45.800]   It doesn't have to be risk, it doesn't have to be a tornado,
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:46.920]   but to keep the air moving
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:51.040]   because then the aerosolized virus particles get dispersed
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.400]   and your exposure is much, much lower.
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:55.600]   And that's really what we're learning.
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:57.720]   I think that's really important.
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:01.520]   - So it has other scenarios over as you care,
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:03.840]   but it was really, really good data vis.
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:06.440]   - Yeah, and you know, we're not making good progress
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:08.840]   with COVID-19, we're really not,
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:11.320]   over, I think it was 1,300 people died yesterday,
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:14.520]   it's just not, it's just not,
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:15.560]   progress is not good.
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:18.040]   And we need to, I think this information needs to get out.
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:20.960]   Did I talk about the Google Doc,
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:24.160]   that a bunch of smart epidemiologists and others
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:29.160]   put out public Google Doc explaining the aerosolized,
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:32.000]   the issue and why? - That's awesome.
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:37.000]   - Yeah, apparently because the old Myazma theory,
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.440]   you know, that bad air made you sick,
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:44.120]   was something that we defeated at the turn of the last century,
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:46.640]   you know, it finally went out the window.
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:49.040]   Docs are very reluctant to ascribe
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:52.760]   and it turns out the CDC and WHO are very reluctant
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:57.760]   to ascribe to aerosolized distribution of a disease.
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:01.880]   They only will admit to it measles is one
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:03.640]   where it's highly contagious.
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:08.880]   And let me see if I can find the doc,
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:11.440]   'cause it's really good, I think everybody should read it.
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:16.440]   I've sent to a lot of friends and family
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:18.800]   so that they know this is,
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:23.800]   the short URL is tinyurl.com/FAQ, capital FAQ dash aerosols.
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:30.880]   And it's a very long piece that's being kept up to date.
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:34.000]   And if you look at the people who put it together,
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.920]   it's a, you know, I know you're concerned,
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:38.760]   Jeff, about credibility.
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:43.480]   These are absolutely the people you would wanna ask about this.
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:46.200]   And they really say it's time to really kind of acknowledge
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:47.440]   that aerosol transmission,
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:51.280]   just like that El Pais story said, is the issue.
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:54.680]   And they talk very clearly about what you can do
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:55.520]   to protect yourself.
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:56.960]   So you should still wash hands
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:59.320]   and socially distance and all that stuff.
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:04.080]   But it's not so much from touching surfaces.
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:06.280]   You know, you don't have to sterilize your groceries
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:07.840]   when you get home.
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:11.200]   It really is from being in a close space
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:14.880]   with a spreader who--
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:19.080]   I see a need for certification of ventilation in buildings.
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:19.920]   Absolutely.
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:21.040]   I really don't wanna go back to my school building.
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:21.880]   Right.
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:22.720]   Those don't appreciate it.
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:24.400]   They talk about that, yeah.
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:25.800]   'Cause you don't wanna put too much fresh air,
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:28.240]   especially when it's winter because it's cold
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:30.240]   and you have to heat it.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:33.040]   Oh, my German friends say that kids are being told
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:34.680]   to bring coats of blankets to school.
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:35.560]   Right, that's good.
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:37.480]   You have ventilation, it's very important in schools.
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:38.440]   Yeah.
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:43.360]   So this was a, I highly recommend this Google Doc.
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:44.720]   Put that in the rundown?
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:47.320]   I didn't, but I will put a link in right now.
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:48.320]   So you have it.
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:54.800]   Tinyurl.com/capitalfq-arissalls.
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:05:04.520]   A-E-R-O-S-O-L-L-S.
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:07.400]   (laughing)
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:08.240]   There we go.
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:09.080]   Thank you.
[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:09.920]   Yeah, the information's out there.
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:11.240]   That's the thing.
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:13.840]   And I just, this was kind of,
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:16.160]   remember the CDC put this up
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:18.720]   and was taken down within eight hours.
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:22.960]   And the CDC said, "Yeah, it wasn't ready for prime time,
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:24.800]   but I think it was political reasons."
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:27.720]   And so this is important to get this information out.
[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:31.840]   And it's understandable that doctors are afraid
[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:33.720]   of going back to the old Myasma theory,
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:36.120]   but that's, but sometimes it is aerosol.
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:39.520]   Let's take a break.
[02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:40.840]   Unless there's anything else,
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:42.520]   there's so many stories we didn't get to everything,
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:44.520]   but if you see something you wanted to talk about.
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:45.360]   I'm going to go to.
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:46.200]   No, and that's the fun.
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:48.040]   This is our PoParee show.
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:50.720]   I've decided where it's just a little bit of this,
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:52.440]   a little bit of that, a little bit of paint.
[02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:54.120]   We'll smell, little light smell.
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:55.800]   So this is-- Grandmuthage.
[02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:56.600]   Twift. Twift.
[02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:57.440]   Twift. Twift. Twift?
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:58.920]   Twift. Twift. Twift. Twift. Twift. Twift. Twift. Twift.
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:01.320]   (laughing)
[02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:02.160]   Sure.
[02:06:02.160 --> 02:06:03.840]   (laughing)
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:08.480]   Our show today brought to you by NetSuite.
[02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:09.960]   This is such a good solution.
[02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:11.880]   I look at Lisa when she's at home
[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:13.640]   and she's like I said, she's in the living room.
[02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:16.800]   She has a 49 inch screen curved monitor
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.120]   and she says, "Yeah, and if I could get another one on top,
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:20.840]   "that would be really great."
[02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:23.760]   And the reason is, and this is a common problem
[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:28.520]   with CFOs, CEOs, financial analysts,
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:31.160]   she needs data from a lot of different sources
[02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:34.160]   and she wants to grok at all in one view.
[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:36.080]   And so she needs all of that.
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:38.920]   That's why NetSuite was invented.
[02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:40.720]   It gives you visibility and control
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:43.680]   over everything in your business, financials, HR,
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:48.080]   inventory, e-commerce, in one place, instantaneously,
[02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:51.240]   it's always up to date a single point of truth.
[02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:53.960]   If you're using QuickBooks and spreadsheets,
[02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:56.720]   so is everybody, but it's slowing you down.
[02:06:56.720 --> 02:06:57.720]   You're slowing you down.
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:59.400]   If you're tired of working on multiple platforms,
[02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:01.560]   you wanna take your business to the next level,
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:03.880]   now's the time to upgrade to NetSuite.
[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:05.240]   Because believe me, I know,
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:08.600]   running a fast growing smaller medium sized business is tough.
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:10.880]   And you need a solution that will make it easier
[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:12.480]   and will evolve to fit your needs.
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:15.640]   And that's why NetSuite is the world's number one cloud
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:16.760]   business system.
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:18.520]   You get cloud-based solutions.
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:21.400]   It'll streamline mission critical business processes.
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:23.160]   It reduces IT costs.
[02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:24.880]   It allows you to grow.
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:26.640]   It allows you to future proof your business
[02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:28.640]   because it's an agile business platform
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:30.720]   that can evolve as you evolve.
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:33.080]   You can close with confidence,
[02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:35.440]   accelerate the financial, close, maintain compliance
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:36.800]   with accounting standards,
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:40.200]   report with accuracy when it comes to financial reports.
[02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:43.360]   Accuracy is the whole kit and kaboodle.
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:45.800]   But you can also drill down in underlying details
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:46.920]   so you can not only get the numbers,
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:49.360]   but see what they mean, what's changing them,
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:50.600]   what's impacting your business.
[02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:52.320]   And it's all in real time.
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:54.760]   Real time metrics, role-based dashboards,
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:56.720]   you'll never wonder what's going on.
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:57.720]   Where's my money going?
[02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:59.880]   Where, what's happening?
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:02.440]   SolarWinds says, quote,
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:04.880]   "We needed more than just a good accounting solution.
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:06.760]   "We had to responsibly manage growth.
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:09.200]   "And NetSuite provided the business application
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:11.760]   "infrastructure to do exactly that."
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:13.160]   Another example, Comvault.
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:15.720]   Comvault turned to NetSuite's cloud solution
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:18.240]   as a platform that could dramatically reduce complexity,
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:20.320]   provide much needed agility.
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:22.560]   They used the Sweet Cloud Development platform
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:25.740]   that let them support their unique business processes,
[02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:28.400]   plus integrate with third-party cloud applications.
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:30.920]   So it really fit what they were up to.
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:32.680]   And then of course, apps from NetSuite partners
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:35.600]   round out the company's updated environment.
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:39.960]   Let NetSuite show you how they can benefit your business

[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:11.840]   Thank you, NetSuite, for your support of this week in Google.
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:14.400]   All right, Stacey, you teased us.
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:16.240]   You said it was going to be good.
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:21.160]   What's your thing this week?
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:23.360]   Oh, that's good.
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:25.440]   That's the Amazon--
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:26.160]   I'm spying on you.
[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:27.160]   Halo.
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:27.680]   Halo.
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:29.240]   You can see Amazon, I'm spying on you.
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:30.160]   I like it.
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:31.200]   OK.
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:34.520]   So I have been-- and y'all, I was not here this week.
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:37.880]   But last week, my thing would have been the Whoop.
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:38.640]   Wait a minute.
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:39.800]   OK, on one wrist--
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:40.560]   This is pretty good.
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:42.480]   On one wrist, she has the Whoop.
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:44.880]   On the other wrist, she's got the Halo.
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:45.880]   Is there anything--
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:46.680]   No.
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:49.600]   Oh, look, who else is wearing a Whoop?
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:50.960]   Mr. Ant Poets Whoopin.
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:52.120]   Whoa.
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:56.880]   All right, so the Whoop is definitely an ant-esque--
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:57.520]   What is the--
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:59.800]   I never heard of the Whoop.
[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:00.760]   What?
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:03.400]   It's a fitness tracker, but it's really
[02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:05.800]   geared for--
[02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:07.440]   It's hard going to get athletes.
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:11.080]   It gives you a lot of data for athletes
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:12.080]   that are trying to perform.
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:13.680]   Leo, not you or me, in other words.
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:15.520]   Is it WhoopMyLife.com?
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:16.040]   No, no.
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:16.880]   No, W.
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:18.120]   No, it's the Whoop.
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:19.320]   Oh, Whoop.
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:20.920]   See, it's not Whoop.
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:22.480]   It's Whoop.
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:23.040]   Whoop.
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:23.760]   Sorry.
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:24.280]   Whoop.
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:24.560]   I'm a--
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:25.560]   Like Cool Whip.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:26.040]   I'm a--
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:27.000]   Whoop.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.280]   Cool Whip.
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:29.000]   Cool Whip.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:29.520]   Whoop.
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:30.520]   Whoop.
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:31.640]   Wait, whoop.
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:32.400]   What?
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:32.920]   What?
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:33.920]   What?
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:34.680]   What?
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:35.720]   It's cool.
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:37.360]   All right.
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:40.440]   So last week, Whoop would have been my choice to show y'all.
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:41.760]   So Whoop is a little--
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:44.080]   So this is going to--
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:45.280]   I'll just let y'all know.
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:47.440]   This is a band that has a subscription.
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:52.720]   You've got to buy a $180 band, it gets a three month
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:54.360]   subscription at $30 a month.
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:55.080]   So it's pricey.
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:56.040]   And this is designed--
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:56.720]   $30 a month.
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:57.280]   For hard.
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:57.760]   Wow.
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:10:59.560]   Is it better than like an Apple Watch?
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:01.840]   I mean--
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:02.440]   Yes.
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:03.920]   Well, it depends.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.440]   So The Whoop is very focused on athletes.
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:11.520]   It doesn't auto detect walking because walks are not
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:12.240]   workouts in the--
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:15.040]   Oh, that's the yes.
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:17.360]   So I'm just saying this is--
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:17.800]   Thanks a lot.
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:19.800]   Make me feel like a walk is a workout.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:20.560]   Trust me.
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:22.240]   When you're our age--
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:23.040]   Yeah.
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:25.480]   A walk is a workout.
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:28.560]   So this is for triathletes and stuff.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.920]   I mean, it's just got $100 million in funding
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:34.720]   from-- and part of the funders were like--
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:36.680]   Peyton Manning, is that his name?
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.180]   Yeah.
[02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:39.160]   Eli Manning's brothers.
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:40.640]   Mahomes?
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:41.960]   They got Mahomes in this.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:46.160]   They're the official recovery and tracking device
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:48.040]   of the NFL Players Association.
[02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:51.120]   They have something called the strain coach.
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:51.440]   Yeah.
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:53.800]   So here's what it looks like.
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:57.800]   Here's my-- for a week or so, this is Stacey's data.
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:11:58.160]   Oh my god.
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:00.520]   This is showing that greed is my recovery.
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:01.720]   Blue is my strain.
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:04.440]   As you can see, most days I sleep real well
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:06.360]   and I don't work that hard.
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:08.480]   But what I have--
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:12.040]   As you can say from this graph--
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:13.040]   This graph shows--
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:14.240]   Stacey's a lardis.
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:15.240]   Yes.
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:16.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:17.240]   Hey.
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:18.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:19.240]   I think it should--
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:22.560]   I will say-- I will say-- so I don't know how Aunt feels
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:26.640]   about this, but the move data is definitely like--
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:29.560]   they love their cardio way more than I love my cardio.
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:30.040]   Yeah.
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:31.520]   They're all about heart stuff.
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:32.360]   Heart rate.
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:33.320]   That's all based on your heart.
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:34.840]   To some degree, I feel like that's
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:37.440]   because that's the thing they could measure.
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:38.120]   Yeah.
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:42.280]   So that may kind of color their preference
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:44.560]   for heart rate variability and resting
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:46.760]   heart rate and all that stuff.
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:48.080]   But they're doing it real well.
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:51.160]   And they do things like say, hey, this
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:52.640]   is how much sleep you need.
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:55.120]   And they tell you what time you should go to bed.
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:56.040]   It's nice.
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:56.840]   Anyway, so that's--
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:57.360]   Any state.
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:04.040]   And I got this because everyone said the Amazon Halo
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:05.200]   copied the whoop.
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:06.240]   Oh.
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:08.840]   It's a lot less expensive than the whoop.
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:14.680]   No, the Amazon Halo is available for $64.99.
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:20.320]   And that includes six months free at $3.99 for the subscription.
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:24.440]   So what's interesting about the Halo is it is for lazy people.
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:26.720]   I have already overshot my week's worth of--
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:28.200]   That's what I want.
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:29.480]   Oh, you took a walk.
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:32.160]   You could take a break the rest of the week.
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.000]   That's what I need.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.480]   So yeah.
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:37.280]   Your data looks like this.
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:39.480]   And it's not showing you my sleep data because--
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:40.480]   That's not good.
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:43.280]   Yeah.
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:44.800]   I didn't wear it last night to sleep
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:47.240]   because I took it off in the middle of the night
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:48.160]   because I'm bad.
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:50.280]   And this is also-- and here's--
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:52.360]   I'll be honest, if you listen to my podcast tomorrow,
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:54.320]   you're going to hear Stacy almost break down in tears
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:55.040]   over this device.
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:56.200]   It's very triggering.
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:59.560]   But the fun thing/scary thing for people
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:01.640]   is it measures your tone.
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:03.120]   So here's my tone, Dan.
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:05.880]   The Halo made you cry?
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:07.800]   Yeah, we'll get to this.
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:10.880]   That's a good fitness device at all.
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:15.480]   It has a microphone on the band.
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:16.720]   And you turn it on.
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:20.320]   You can opt in to having it listen to your tone.
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:23.360]   And so I opted in because I was very curious because people
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:25.240]   say I'm kind of like a jerk.
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:27.240]   Sometimes they're like Stacy or a little too crusted.
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:28.240]   You do not.
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:30.240]   Oh, that's so not true.
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:31.240]   No.
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:31.640]   It's OK.
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:36.240]   So what I have discovered-- and we'll do this live just to see.
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:36.840]   Hold on.
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:40.160]   I'm going to show y'all if my phone decides to work.
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:40.800]   Here we go.
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:42.640]   We're going to start the tone test.
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:44.360]   So can you just need it?
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:44.880]   Yes.
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:46.080]   Here's me talking normally.
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:48.200]   I don't know if you can actually see the work.
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:48.760]   It's--
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:49.960]   Well, so I say moral panic.
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:50.520]   Then she's going to--
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:51.680]   tone's going to change.
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:53.400]   Oh, no, not moral panic.
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:55.040]   Oh, look at that.
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:56.040]   It doesn't--
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:57.440]   It just shot over to the right.
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:14:58.440]   I'm going to be excited about that.
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:00.240]   Yeah, it shot away over to the right on that.
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:01.080]   Oh, that's weird.
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:02.600]   I'm almost never in that level.
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:04.200]   Normally, I'm right about here.
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:06.720]   And I tend to go more towards negative.
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:10.800]   So it's really interesting to see how it--
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:12.000]   Kind of judgy.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.360]   It's really judgy.
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:14.720]   It's totally judgy.
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:18.160]   So if you're worried about this, Amazon does A is opt in.
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:22.520]   But B, Amazon does say it will--
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:23.440]   what's the word I'm looking for.
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:25.880]   It deletes your recordings every day at--
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:27.800]   or every 24 hours it deletes them.
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:30.920]   You can also go in and delete them manually.
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:32.800]   So mostly, it says I'm knowledgeable,
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:36.520]   interested, and focused, which is probably how you would--
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:37.840]   I just got an invitation.
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:39.520]   Should I buy it?
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:40.320]   Well, I don't know.
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:41.920]   So here's the other thing.
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:44.200]   So tone is kind of fun and interesting.
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:46.840]   The activity tracking is very lenient.
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:48.840]   It gives you points.
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:50.360]   So it tracks steps and things like that.
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:52.880]   But what it does is give you points for like any time
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:54.640]   your heart rate's above a certain amount.
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:57.200]   And you get two times the points if your heart rate goes
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:15:59.000]   into an intense area.
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.400]   So it's calculating for 150 points a week
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:05.920]   because that's what the US government says is a fair amount.
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:08.160]   What does it say about your use of commas?
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:09.520]   Does it say anything there?
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:10.840]   It doesn't say anything.
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:13.680]   It also subtracts points if you're setting two.
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:16.080]   So during this show, I'm going to lose three points
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:17.720]   because I'm going to have SAT for three hours.
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:18.920]   This actually sounds better.
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:20.720]   I was hearing a lot of negatives about it,
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:22.760]   but it actually doesn't sound that bad.
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:24.760]   Let's get to the part where I started crying.
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:25.280]   OK.
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:26.240]   Why did you cry?
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:29.240]   People misunderstood what it's actually used for.
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:30.240]   Maybe.
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:32.960]   A lot of people tend to think these bands are just pedometers.
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:35.720]   There's more to these bands than just a pedometer.
[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:37.080]   It's a fancy pedometer.
[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:40.600]   They read story about--
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.400]   they talk to the doctor in charge.
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:43.920]   And he talked about it being wellness.
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:46.200]   So things like understanding your tone
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:49.080]   might help you not alienate people you love.
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:50.520]   If you're constantly negative--
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:54.640]   Lisa wants me to have this guarantee you.
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.600]   Seriously, she does not like my tone.
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:02.840]   So yeah, it gives you a very achievable activity goal
[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:04.560]   I feel.
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:06.000]   Now, it also does.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.480]   In other words, easy.
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:09.920]   I'm like, whoop.
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:11.120]   Yeah, whoops.
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:12.280]   Dang, man.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:15.640]   I mean, whoop, whoop would make me cry?
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:17.520]   It's tough.
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:19.520]   Yeah, it's intense.
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:22.840]   It also has a section about your body.
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:25.200]   This is where it offers to let you
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:28.760]   take scans and it will measure your body fat percentage.
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:30.360]   My body, myself.
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:31.400]   Yep.
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:34.600]   It does ask you when you take the pictures,
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:37.560]   when you start the process to take the pictures to do the scan,
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:39.440]   it says, hey, do you want to keep these in the cloud
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:40.520]   or on the device?
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:42.400]   I really recommend you keep them on the device
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:44.480]   unless you are gorgeous.
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:46.320]   And you probably could send it to the cloud.
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:49.240]   And that would be fine because you are totally healthy.
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:55.120]   But they also ask you before you take the scan,
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:58.760]   they tell you, please get into a bikini or some tight shorts.
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:00.440]   I don't have a bikini.
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:02.280]   No, you would be in the tight-cating bikers.
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:03.120]   That's a visual.
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:04.440]   I don't want Leo.
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:07.000]   Yeah, don't think about it.
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.120]   And then you take pictures.
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:13.400]   And you basically stick the phone on the table
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:16.680]   and it's going to go beep and you're going to go like this.
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:18.240]   Like you're at the airport thing.
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:19.240]   And you're going to do it.
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:20.400]   Wow.
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:21.480]   I didn't do it.
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:23.040]   I didn't do it because I can't do it.
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:26.520]   I just physically cannot take my clothes mostly off
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:27.360]   and put a bikini on.
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:28.360]   No, I would love to do it.
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:29.440]   I just can't.
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:31.000]   So that's the part that made me cry.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.520]   Because I was just like, I can't do it.
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:34.200]   I can't do this.
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:35.560]   That's why you talk about that on Twitter.
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:37.120]   Why don't you get a body double, Stacey?
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:39.240]   Get somebody else to do it for you.
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:41.880]   I told Kevin can do it.
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:44.080]   You looked like a 48-year-old man.
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:48.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:50.400]   So you're told is bad.
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:54.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.920]   So that's my devices of this week and last week
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:18:58.960]   since I missed last week.
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:00.760]   But I just wanted--
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:04.240]   they're totally different for different audiences
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:06.000]   and people, I think.
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.120]   And I'm very concerned.
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:11.960]   Well, I'm definitely not a Hooper.
[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:12.520]   Look at me.
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:14.280]   Do I look like a Hooper?
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:15.280]   I'm a high-level.
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:18.600]   I'm not an invite for the Amazon band,
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:20.480]   but I'm yet to see anything about it.
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:21.000]   I just went there.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.280]   Is there able to be ordered now?
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:23.800]   Well, I just went there and it says,
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:24.880]   you're invited--
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:27.200]   invitation expires in four days, which I think
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:28.840]   is probably a fake like.
[02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:29.720]   Better order now.
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:30.080]   No, that's true.
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:30.720]   By now.
[02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:31.880]   They will.
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:34.080]   I mean, they're basically-- they made a limited number,
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:35.520]   and they're sending it out to people.
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:37.600]   I applied when they came out, because I
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:39.200]   thought this sounds interesting.
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:40.880]   Well, give it to Ant for wellness.
[02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:42.160]   All right, I'll order it.
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:42.960]   Yeah.
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:44.080]   Thank you, sir.
[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:47.240]   I'll put it to those places.
[02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:51.480]   But yeah, so that's my devices that Stacey is reviewing
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:52.200]   this week.
[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:53.440]   Next week, I've got to agree with.
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:57.720]   That smile.
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:20:02.200]   So Dr. Mom, who was one of our regulars,
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:03.920]   said she had the Halo band.
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:08.920]   And because she was social distancing and wearing masks
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:12.400]   on her walk, she would shout to people.
[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:14.280]   And it said, you are so angry.
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:18.680]   Well, it did--
[02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:20.200]   Well.
[02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:23.480]   So that seems kind of counterproductive.
[02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:26.320]   It definitely takes a volume into perspective.
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:28.760]   OK.
[02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:30.320]   So I showed you a little graph thing.
[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:32.840]   But if I look at-- it also flags things,
[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:35.360]   like it calls them notable moments.
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.400]   And it says, you had one phrase that
[02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:39.400]   sounded satisfied, proud, or appreciative.
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:40.560]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:41.560]   Do you feel--
[02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:43.000]   Do you feel like it's an accurate--
[02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:43.640]   Like it's--
[02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:46.840]   I feel like it's voodoo.
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:49.480]   I feel like it's sort of accurate.
[02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:53.200]   I know that I have a lower effect than many people.
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:54.320]   And I think that comes across--
[02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:55.160]   Like me.
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:57.000]   But it doesn't come across--
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.040]   I mean, from a nuanced point of view,
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:02.400]   it does not come across as negative.
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:05.840]   It comes across as very calm and soothing and nice.
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:08.440]   Unless it yells at you and tells you you're being an ass.
[02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:09.240]   But that's what I mean.
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:10.240]   I think that--
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:11.240]   I think that--
[02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:12.240]   I think that--
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:13.240]   --the halo is not nuanced at all.
[02:21:13.240 --> 02:21:14.240]   It may not-- I mean--
[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:15.240]   Not yet.
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:16.480]   Like, not yet.
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:20.200]   And it has-- the axes are positive and negative
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:22.240]   and low energy and high energy.
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:23.240]   OK.
[02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:24.240]   I'd be very interested to see what it does.
[02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:25.240]   I'm going to wear it.
[02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:26.240]   Yeah.
[02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:27.240]   How about as a sleep tracker?
[02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:30.240]   The people with their bikinis on look so happy.
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:31.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:32.240]   Which is very happy.
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:33.240]   It really do, yes.
[02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:34.240]   Yeah.
[02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:35.240]   They're crying inside, Jeff.
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:36.240]   Take a picture of me.
[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:37.240]   It's fine.
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:38.240]   Trust me.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:40.880]   They do show the people with their little muffin tops.
[02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:42.840]   And I'm like, that does--
[02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:43.840]   Oh, I sit for me.
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:44.840]   I'm sorry.
[02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:45.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:48.480]   No one's going to see it or is somebody going to see it?
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:51.720]   Like, they send it to a doctor who says, oh, my God.
[02:21:51.720 --> 02:21:54.040]   You need surgery.
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:55.040]   So I--
[02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:57.840]   No one's going to see it.
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:21:59.240]   This is-- I'm going to--
[02:21:59.240 --> 02:22:03.240]   I struggled with an eating disorder when I was younger.
[02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:05.440]   Oh, so you have image body, image issues.
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:06.440]   Yeah.
[02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:08.040]   So just the idea of taking--
[02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:12.040]   --taking a photo, including on a bathing suit is just--
[02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:13.440]   No, actually, I know it's funny.
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:15.440]   I know a lot of women like that.
[02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:17.640]   Not guys so much, but a lot of gals like that.
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:19.440]   Oh, I wouldn't--
[02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:20.440]   --nothing more.
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:22.240]   I used to be thin, so--
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:23.240]   But you wouldn't care.
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:24.240]   It is--
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:25.240]   It wouldn't make you cry, Jeff.
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:28.240]   It's like, you just go, oh, fine, whatever.
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:31.640]   And I have a scale that measures my body fat.
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:33.640]   So I am curious how well it works.
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:35.640]   But I'm curious enough to--
[02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:36.640]   I'm going to do it.
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:37.640]   I'll do it.
[02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:38.640]   I'll do it for you.
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:40.640]   Even if that makes me cry, I'm going to do it.
[02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:41.640]   How about the sleep tracker?
[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:42.640]   Is it pretty good?
[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:49.640]   I really torn on this, because the-- and I will say, I only wear the sleep tracker for
[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:50.640]   two nights last night.
[02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:53.640]   I took it off apparently, because it's really uncomfortable.
[02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:57.640]   Just the side of my body-- I don't know why-- the sides toughened up.
[02:22:57.640 --> 02:22:58.640]   But it was not accurate.
[02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:01.640]   Well, it was vastly different from the whoop.
[02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:06.640]   And the whoop was more in line with the Fitbit, which I have worn for years.
[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:10.240]   So it was like an hour and a half off.
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:11.240]   Oh, wow.
[02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:12.760]   I have a sleep tracker in my bed.
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:16.920]   So I'll compare it to the sort of sleep tracker, which I think is very accurate.
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:18.640]   And I have the or a ring.
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:19.640]   I could wear that.
[02:23:19.640 --> 02:23:20.640]   I could have like sensors.
[02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:22.640]   Just do get everything.
[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:25.640]   Compare the mall where my apple watch, everything.
[02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:27.640]   I'll compare them all and see.
[02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:28.640]   There you go.
[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:32.840]   So I didn't-- I don't know if the sleep tracking is very good, because I haven't tested it
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:33.840]   for long enough.
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:34.840]   I'm trying.
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:38.840]   21 is reminding me that I have a scale that tweets out my weight every time I eat.
[02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:39.840]   Oh, that's right.
[02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:40.840]   I remember that.
[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:41.840]   I remember that.
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:43.840]   Keep forgetting that I-- oh, it's still there.
[02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:44.840]   It still does it.
[02:23:44.840 --> 02:23:45.840]   I just-- I keep forgetting.
[02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:46.840]   Oh, my God.
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:47.840]   I just weighed myself.
[02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:48.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:52.840]   Aunt, what did you think of the whoop, whoop.
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:53.840]   That thing is great.
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:57.440]   Again, because it's not necessarily something for just the--
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:23:58.840]   No, it's for serious athletes.
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:00.840]   Beginner or novice or whatever.
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:07.840]   This is really designed for the real deal athlete that's trying to get better or just
[02:24:07.840 --> 02:24:11.640]   really hit a certain mark in their fitness levels, and it's going to make sure that they're
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:13.840]   out there doing the work.
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:16.840]   If you're not doing the work, it's not tracking anything.
[02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:19.840]   So how do you feel about their measure of your work, though?
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:23.840]   Because yesterday-- well, just how do you feel?
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:25.840]   You can measure walking.
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:27.840]   You'd have to go in and dial it in half.
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:28.840]   You'd have to get--
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:29.840]   But I'm not walking.
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:31.840]   I mean, I did a full weight exercise.
[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:35.840]   I did a full functional fitness with weights and push-ups.
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:38.840]   And I was really pushing myself hard.
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:39.840]   Yes.
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:40.840]   Yeah.
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:44.840]   And I was just a 10 level strain on that workout.
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:48.840]   And I was like-- and it was like a 19 level strain day.
[02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:52.840]   And I was like, I couldn't have done much more beyond that.
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:53.840]   How long was that?
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:55.840]   Because that actually does sound about right.
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:57.840]   How long was that workout?
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:00.840]   Like 45 minutes.
[02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:03.840]   I did mountain climbers forever.
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:07.840]   If you were talking like 30 minutes, that 10 number does sound about right.
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:09.840]   And it's different for everybody.
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:14.840]   But if that's the thing, if you have a day that's like-- because it tells you, it's like
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:17.840]   you can get-- you should go for like a 19 level strain.
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:18.840]   Right.
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:19.840]   Because you rested more.
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:20.840]   Yeah.
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:22.840]   But then you're like--
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:24.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:25.840]   I don't think I--
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:27.840]   I don't think I ever wanted to do that.
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:29.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:30.840]   Anyway.
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:31.840]   But again, think about it.
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:35.840]   They're backed by the NFL Players Association.
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:37.840]   And you know how those guys train.
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:39.840]   Yeah, but it's not easy.
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:41.840]   Yeah.
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:42.840]   So yeah, I would say this is proud.
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:44.840]   The whoop is not for--
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:45.840]   Not for me.
[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:49.840]   And I have a lot of friends like in the venture world or the tech bro world who use it.
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:50.840]   Oh, they love it.
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:52.840]   And I'm just kind of-- they love this stuff.
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:53.840]   They love it.
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:54.840]   It's like data plus--
[02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:55.840]   Yeah.
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:56.840]   Oh.
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:25:57.840]   Crossfit.
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:25:58.840]   All that.
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:25:59.840]   Yeah.
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:02.840]   Jeff, how about a number?
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:03.840]   Oh, God.
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:04.840]   He's standing up.
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:05.840]   What's the number?
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:06.840]   I've been sent to presume--
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:07.840]   Two seven hours.
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:08.840]   Oh, go ahead.
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:09.840]   You can walk around.
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:10.840]   That's fine.
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:12.840]   No, no, I'm tethered.
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:13.840]   Let me see.
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:15.840]   There's been numbers.
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:20.840]   You see, he's one of those little bicycles for under your desk.
[02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:21.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:22.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:24.840]   Like I'm like--
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:25.840]   I'm not--
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:29.840]   And we could use it to power your microphone so you can only scream about the camera.
[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:30.840]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:32.840]   That's what you want.
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:33.840]   Yeah.
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:34.840]   Do it.
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:35.840]   [SINGING]
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:36.840]   My panic.
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:37.840]   [SINGING]
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:38.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:41.840]   That would be awesome.
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:44.840]   Hey, Ed, I think you're my friend.
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:45.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:49.840]   Oh, you were the nice guy on the show.
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:51.840]   Let's see here.
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:55.840]   The Orange County Register's pre-implant is being bought by Amazon for $63 million.
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:57.840]   It's going to tear it down, put it up at warehouse.
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:26:58.840]   Oh, boy.
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:26:59.840]   Oh.
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:02.840]   Bezos sold $3 million in stock.
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:04.840]   But that's kind of a--
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:06.840]   It's kind of says something.
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:07.840]   Yeah.
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:14.840]   I mean, here's the local newspaper destroyed by Craigslist being torn down by Amazon.
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:15.840]   Now, now, now.
[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:18.840]   And they're going to turn it into a warehouse.
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:19.840]   A warehouse.
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:21.840]   A distribution center.
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:22.840]   That's sad.
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:24.840]   That is really the story of our times.
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:25.840]   It is.
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:26.840]   Yeah.
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:32.840]   Alexis O'Hadean, wonderfully nice guy, recalls selling Reddit for $10 million to my old boss,
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:33.840]   Steve Newhouse.
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:34.840]   Wow.
[02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:37.840]   I wish Steve had more advisors.
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:42.840]   Now, as time went on, he didn't talk about this in the Twitter thread.
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:47.840]   As I know it, this was about the time I left the company.
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:52.840]   Steve had wanted-- I don't know if I should say it.
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:53.840]   Dig.
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:54.840]   He loved dig.
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:55.840]   Oh, wow.
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:56.840]   Really?
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:27:58.840]   And they kind of weren't-- I just know that.
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:27:59.840]   But Reddit was his second thing.
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:01.840]   Kevin would not sell him dig.
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:05.840]   I don't know that-- I don't know whatever happened, but I know that Steve loved dig.
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:07.840]   But then Reddit was kind of the second choice.
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:09.840]   But look what happened.
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:11.840]   Who's still around and who's not?
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:12.840]   Yeah.
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:13.840]   Exactly.
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:16.840]   And I think that what happened was Steve Newhouse.
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:18.840]   Is that Steve Newhouse's son?
[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:20.840]   No, that's his nephew.
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:22.840]   He's now the chairman of the company.
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:25.840]   He's now the top new house.
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:30.840]   And so as I understand it, they created equity.
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:36.840]   They kind of spun it off so that there was equity so that they could motivate all the executives.
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:40.840]   And I would assume Alexis got a little more value than coming back as chairman.
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:42.840]   But I thought that was interesting.
[02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:43.840]   He's very disciplined.
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:44.840]   Shall we?
[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:45.840]   He's what?
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:46.840]   He's married to Serena Williams.
[02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:49.840]   And that is the thing I know about him.
[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:50.840]   He's very nice.
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:52.840]   He's a great guy.
[02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:57.840]   And I was friends with both him and Kevin Rose, the dig guy and the Reddit guy.
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:28:59.840]   And they're both great.
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:03.840]   And I wish Si had paid him more, to be honest.
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:05.840]   I mean, Steve had paid him more.
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:07.840]   Well, I was sized money at the time.
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:08.840]   Right.
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:13.840]   Xiaomi is going to build a factory to produce 10 million phones with a $1 million.
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:16.840]   10 million phones without any humans.
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:19.840]   Well, what could our phones without humans?
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:21.840]   I know.
[02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:24.840]   And finally, Zoom has the happiest employees.
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:26.840]   I bet their stock is doing wonderful.
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:28.840]   I wonder why.
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:30.840]   That's very odd.
[02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:32.840]   What are they so happy about?
[02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:33.840]   I don't know.
[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:37.840]   Do you think if you work at Zoom, you're on Zoom even more than the rest of us?
[02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:41.840]   Like it sounds awful.
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:42.840]   How do you run it?
[02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:43.840]   Zoom.
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:45.840]   Employee stock purchase.
[02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:47.840]   Maybe that's why.
[02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:52.840]   It's the second year in a row, the Zoom is the happiest employees.
[02:29:52.840 --> 02:29:55.840]   Maybe they were confused and they thought Zappos.
[02:29:55.840 --> 02:29:59.840]   Choose it that you have been.
[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:02.840]   They ask things like, is your work environment positive or negative?
[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:04.840]   Do you believe you're paid fairly?
[02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:06.840]   Do you feel burned out at work?
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:10.840]   Are you typically excited about going to work each day and do you look forward to interacting
[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:12.840]   with your coworkers?
[02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:17.840]   And actually, there's number four on compensation after Google, Facebook and Microsoft.
[02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:19.840]   That's interesting.
[02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:21.840]   And they've won in two years in a row.
[02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:23.840]   That's really cool.
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:27.840]   You know, hiring nice people and making it a, I mean, that's an important thing.
[02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:34.840]   Like, that's why one of the big questions that predicts if someone's going to leave or stay
[02:30:34.840 --> 02:30:39.840]   is, do you have a best friend at work or do you have a good friend at work?
[02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:45.840]   Well, and they point out in this article that the CEO of Zoom, Eric Yuan, was working at
[02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:48.840]   Cisco WebEx and left because he hated the company and founded Zoom.
[02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:54.840]   So maybe it wasn't a reaction to a bad job that he decided to build a good company.
[02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:57.840]   And your pick of the week, my friend.
[02:30:57.840 --> 02:30:59.840]   Well, I have two.
[02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:06.840]   The first one, I got a text message from my old neighbor back in South Kaculaki, the
[02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:08.840]   sister of Chad Bozeman.
[02:31:08.840 --> 02:31:17.840]   And she says, we've started a fund for St. Jude Children's Research because he's, he's,
[02:31:17.840 --> 02:31:24.840]   he did a lot with them and they have a fund in his name where you can donate to St. Jude's
[02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:30.840]   Children's research so people can get services for free there because we all know those
[02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:33.840]   medical bills can be quite expensive.
[02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:38.840]   I created a short redirect link, antpruit.com/chad.
[02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:40.840]   It'll take you straight to that site.
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:42.840]   I don't think it works.
[02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:43.840]   No, it died.
[02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:45.840]   I don't think it works.
[02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:46.840]   I just clicked it.
[02:31:46.840 --> 02:31:47.840]   Oh, don't.
[02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:49.840]   Well, I can do that like right.
[02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:55.840]   Let me type it in, antpruit.com/chad, right?
[02:31:55.840 --> 02:31:56.840]   Right.
[02:31:56.840 --> 02:31:57.840]   You know what?
[02:31:57.840 --> 02:32:00.840]   It could have been the, the Google spreadsheets screwed it up.
[02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:01.840]   No, it does work.
[02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:02.840]   Yeah.
[02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:03.840]   There it is.
[02:32:03.840 --> 02:32:04.840]   Antpruit.com/chad.
[02:32:04.840 --> 02:32:05.840]   Nice.
[02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:09.840]   So if you want to donate there, I appreciate it.
[02:32:09.840 --> 02:32:12.840]   And you know, you're doing it in Chad's name.
[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:15.840]   Just continue to boost his legacy out there.
[02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:16.840]   That's really nice.
[02:32:16.840 --> 02:32:17.840]   Yeah.
[02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:20.840]   And number two, I was just going to say go watch Hands on Tech.
[02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:25.840]   I had a lot of fun reviewing the Lumet S5 and just, yeah.
[02:32:25.840 --> 02:32:29.840]   I'm going to be watching slightly overpriced, but it says, yeah, that's camera.
[02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:31.840]   Is it, it's full frame, right?
[02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:33.840]   Full frame mirrorless.
[02:32:33.840 --> 02:32:34.840]   Nice.
[02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:38.840]   Not quite as big as the S1H that you and I played with at CES.
[02:32:38.840 --> 02:32:39.840]   Yeah.
[02:32:39.840 --> 02:32:40.840]   I remember that.
[02:32:40.840 --> 02:32:41.840]   Yeah.
[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:42.840]   But it's got a lot of capabilities.
[02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:48.840]   And today they just released a firmware update to it to where you can externally record 5K off
[02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:50.840]   of this thing.
[02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:51.840]   All right.
[02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:57.840]   Mr. Antpruit, Hands on Photography, Hands on Wellness and a Hooper.
[02:32:57.840 --> 02:33:00.840]   Hands on Tech, all that.
[02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:04.840]   It's cool hoop.
[02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:05.840]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, wait a minute.
[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:07.840]   I didn't give you all the credit you deserved.
[02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:08.840]   Oh, oh, oh.
[02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:12.840]   At the beginning of the show, he is in fact a Leonard Tow professor for journalistic innovation
[02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:19.840]   at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:20.840]   Thank you very much for being here.
[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:24.840]   Buzzmachine.com is his blog at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter.
[02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:25.840]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:28.840]   Anything you want to else you want to plug?
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:29.840]   No, no, no.
[02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:31.400]   No, that I have my own sub domain.
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:35.840]   I should probably change my lower third to Jeff Jarvis dot medium dot com.
[02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:40.840]   Oh, oh, oh, it's moving up in the world.
[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:41.840]   Moving on.
[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:42.840]   People, I'll be up to you.
[02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:49.840]   Hey, I do want to say that Mr. Craig Newmark has followed me on Twitter.
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:54.680]   It always fascinates me seeing him tweet me here and there are some random stuff.
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:55.680]   And I'm like, really?
[02:33:55.680 --> 02:34:00.680]   He's trying me and I forget that, oh, Mr. Jarvis, that's probably one of my dears, a connection
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:01.680]   there.
[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:02.680]   He's such a guy.
[02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:03.680]   He's loved the show for a long time.
[02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:04.680]   Hi, Craig.
[02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:05.680]   Hey, Craig.
[02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:06.680]   Such a kind man.
[02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:10.280]   It always just sort of boosts my ego whenever I hear from him.
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:15.680]   If you do anything about pigeons, if you take pictures of pigeons, Craig loves pigeons.
[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:16.680]   He loves pigeons.
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:18.680]   And I was, "Hey, it's the Orange County Register."
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:21.680]   No, he doesn't know how to stop that.
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:23.680]   That's kind of mean to say that Craig's list.
[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:24.680]   Stop that.
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:25.840]   Put them out of business.
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:27.480]   What put them out of business, the OC Ridge?
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:29.720]   Well, a bad owner before the late times.
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:30.720]   That'll do it.
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:31.720]   It's not out of business.
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:32.720]   It's just the late times.
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:33.720]   They just didn't need a building, apparently.
[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:34.720]   No.
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:35.720]   No.
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:36.720]   Well, all news.
[02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:41.240]   And most newspapers, I mean, my former hometown paper, they're building as they sold it and
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:43.640]   they're moving the news organization, which is sad.
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:44.640]   Yeah.
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:50.440]   I mean, I do feel like in your news organization in the middle of your city or the down, you
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:51.680]   know, that's important.
[02:34:51.680 --> 02:34:52.680]   Yeah.
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:54.680]   But now they're all moved out to the suburbs.
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:55.680]   Right.
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:56.680]   Yeah.
[02:34:56.680 --> 02:34:59.720]   Where the plant is, they moved out to be near their printing presses.
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:03.680]   Usually they just move where it's cheaper.
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:08.240]   I think of the Gray Lady building, the Times building, which is no longer where the Times
[02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:09.240]   is, right, Jeff?
[02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:10.240]   Did they move?
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:11.240]   It's across the street from the--
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:12.240]   Yeah.
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:13.240]   They're next to us.
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:14.240]   They're across from the Port Authority.
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:15.240]   Yeah.
[02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:16.240]   Yeah.
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:17.240]   That's Stacy Higgin-Botham.
[02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:22.160]   She is the host of Stacy on-- actually, she's the patron.
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:23.160]   I don't know what you are.
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:24.160]   She's the boss.
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:25.160]   She's the boss.
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:27.360]   She's the boss at StacyOnIOT.com.
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:30.200]   Subscribe to our free newsletter, highly recommended.
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:34.200]   Also check out the Events tab because there's always great events coming up.
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:37.040]   Oh, we did a really good-- thank you, Aunt for coming.
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:38.440]   We did a great event.
[02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:39.840]   That's why I wasn't here last week.
[02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:41.000]   It was a wonderful event.
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:48.640]   So if you're interested in the Smart Home, all the stuff is at StacyOnIOT.com/SmartHome
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:49.640]   and tons of content.
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:50.800]   Oh, nice.
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:54.480]   I like it that you make that-- that's the level up the Smart Home event you had a few days
[02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:55.480]   ago.
[02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:56.480]   Yes.
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:35:58.160]   I like that that you make that available after the--
[02:35:58.160 --> 02:35:59.960]   It was really well done, too.
[02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:02.480]   Stacy's good.
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:04.520]   You wouldn't know what to look at her.
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:07.160]   I was like, I was so nice.
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:08.600]   Oh, just kidding.
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:09.600]   It does, Tza.
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:12.000]   Actually, I love that scarf.
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.160]   Actually, to be serious, that is a great scarf.
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:16.160]   Awesome.
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:17.160]   No, you're wonderful.
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:18.920]   Are you kidding?
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:24.640]   StacyOnIOT.com, don't forget the podcast she does with Kevin Tofel, the 48-year-old man.
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:26.640]   That is the IoT podcast.
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:31.160]   It's called the Internet of Things podcast, not the 48-year-old man.
[02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:38.080]   But you should see him in a bikini.
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:39.080]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:40.080]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:41.080]   Thank you, Aunt.
[02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:42.080]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:43.080]   We do this week in Google.
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:44.320]   It's a fun show.
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:47.480]   It's kind of our potpourri at the end of the week, and I enjoy doing it.
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:49.920]   It's the end of my week, not the end of yours.
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:50.920]   Every Wednesday.
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:52.880]   It's going to work, if only.
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:57.680]   Every Wednesday, 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2100 UTC.
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:01.160]   You can watch or listen live at twit.tv/live.
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:06.400]   If you're doing that, chat with us in the chat, remirc.twit.tv.
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:10.760]   That's where all the smart kids in the back of the class are sitting through on spitballs.
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:16.800]   You can also get on demand versions of the show at our website as with all my shows, twit.tv/twig
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:18.880]   for this one.
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:23.120]   Or there's a YouTube channel with all the this week in Google videos.
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:27.520]   Or subscribe in your favorite podcast application that way you'll get it automatically.
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:29.920]   Soon as we're done.
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:30.920]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:32.720]   Have a wonderful week.
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:33.720]   We'll see you next week.
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:39.040]   Y'all need to update the show image to have Aunt, too.
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:42.520]   Oh, I talked to Karsten about that.
[02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:43.520]   He was doing that.
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:44.520]   Yes, I remember you.
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:46.680]   No, I was like, oh, it took me a year.
[02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:48.440]   So I figure we should start.
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:50.680]   Yeah, it takes a while.
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:51.680]   Which is fun.
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:52.680]   There's various versions of it.
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:55.440]   It was definitely all on one version, but it wasn't on one of the one of the top.
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:37:58.600]   You mean the banner here at the top like this?
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:00.040]   Problem is, we got to get...
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:01.280]   Yes, that one too.
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:02.280]   We can't.
[02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:03.280]   We don't have a photographer.
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:04.280]   Oh.
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:05.280]   In the room.
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:06.280]   In the room.
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:08.320]   So I'm sure we'll work on it.
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:10.760]   But you notice Auntie is in the, in the bile.
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:11.760]   Oh, well, yeah.
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:12.760]   Yeah.
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:13.760]   I'm just, you know, you got to see his face.
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:15.960]   And he's got a good face and green lighting.
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:17.720]   He's got a good face.
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:19.120]   More than just a face.
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:21.600]   He's more than just a pretty face.
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:25.120]   You know, we could Photoshop this and just put his head sticking out on the side there.
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:26.640]   Do you wait to do...
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:28.960]   Like, come it out from the side of the Stacy's monitor.
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:30.440]   That would be kind of funny.
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:31.440]   Please do it.
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:35.200]   I can just shove another finger in there.
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:36.720]   Can you stick around for one second?
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:38.440]   Like a question, quick question for you.
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:39.440]   Yes.
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:40.440]   It's a new mark.
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:41.440]   Hang in there.
[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:42.440]   Hold on a second.
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:43.440]   Oh.
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:45.440]   I haven't finished the show yet.
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:46.440]   Oh.
[02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:47.920]   I'm so sorry.
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:50.560]   You were so near, but then Stacy's stopped.
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:51.560]   And now...
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:52.560]   I was so sorry.
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:53.560]   It's over.
[02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:54.560]   I'm sorry.
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:57.640]   I think I finished the show.
[02:38:57.640 --> 02:38:58.640]   I don't know.
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:01.000]   I think I was finishing the show when Stacy said...
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:02.000]   Oh, oh.
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.400]   And, and, and that.
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:04.400]   So now it's over.
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:05.400]   I waited.
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:08.680]   I waited until you said, like, thank you and all that stuff.
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:09.680]   Yeah.
[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:11.600]   And then I said, and have a wonderful week.
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:13.600]   And you went, oh, oh.
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:15.600]   I don't know why.
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:17.720]   No, that makes it.
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:19.520]   That makes the show.
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:20.520]   One more Twit.
