[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.320]   Actually, we should say, what are we
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.760]   going to call it?
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.400]   Motorola RUGLE.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.160]   You're joining me right now to get the latest Google and cloud
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.400]   news to my left, Gina Trippani of smartawear.org,
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.360]   lifehacker.com.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.000]   Great to see you once again, Gina.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.720]   Great to see you.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.120]   So glad to have the core three back.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.800]   Yay.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.140]   I know.
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.960]   I missed you guys.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.680]   Did I miss two shows?
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.120]   Wow.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   Actually, just one.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.640]   But neither you or Jeff were in last week's show.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.920]   So I was cold and frightened.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.600]   It was lovely.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.800]   As you said, on Google+, we got the band back together.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.300]   Yeah.
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.400]   Jeff Jarvis is here also from the City University of New York
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.320]   where he teaches journalism.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.560]   He's also a blogger at buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.960]   The author--
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.280]   On base.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.480]   On base.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.480]   I'm the band.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.320]   On base?
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.600]   That's the name of our band?
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.760]   No, I'm on base.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.280]   Oh.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.760]   On base.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.640]   That driver's on base.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.960]   Sorry, I was going for that.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.320]   I get it.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.800]   Is Gina a drummer?
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.280]   I was like, is that a baseball reference?
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.640]   We are so bad.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880]   God, we're a bunch of nerds.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.880]   I'll be the drummer.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.960]   I think Gina is our lovely--
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.480]   Lead singer.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.640]   --it's a crush on lead singer.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.320]   Yes, she is definitely the lead singer.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.320]   I'll be caught in love.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.600]   Yeah, I'll be caught in love.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.840]   I think you're more pixies, but OK.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.320]   OK.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.920]   And then--
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.720]   Oh, thank God.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.760]   Yeah, not so bad.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.480]   And then Kevin Marks is also here of Salesforce Now, right?
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.360]   Yes, that's why Salesforce--
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.120]   It's great to see you.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.480]   But Kevin's worked everywhere, including Google itself,
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.840]   the mothership Apple, British telecommies
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.320]   and expert in standards, and everything else,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.200]   including, I turned out, video lighting.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.560]   I didn't know this, but he was a BBC video engineer
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.640]   when he first started out.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.920]   That's amazing.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.000]   My dark pastel.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.640]   How did you transition from that into the internet stuff?
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.600]   Well, when I was at the BBC, there
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.720]   was a group called the Interactive Television Unit, which
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.080]   was the group that made the BBC Doomsday Project, which
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.720]   some of you may vaguely remember,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.800]   as an attempt in 1986 to survey the UK
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.360]   and produce an educational video disc and computer
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.200]   system around that.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.560]   Wow.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.720]   So that lot of finished in '86, but the unit was still there
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.360]   in '88 when I joined.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.080]   And after I've been doing some mainstream audio video
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   stuff for a while, I went and worked there
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.760]   for an attachment for an internal reassignment.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.880]   And then they spun out as a startup in 1990
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.200]   as multimedia corporation, which is where I then
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.920]   worked for 1990 through '97.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.080]   And you did a quick time in Apple.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   So you stayed in the video arena for a while.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.560]   That's right.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.400]   We've got to have--
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.520]   I mean, we should get Kevin on triangulation,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.480]   because we always talk about the day's events with Kevin,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.880]   because he's such a great insight.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.440]   But I think his story is fascinating.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.800]   We might have an opening next week, Kevin.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.840]   We'll be in tonight.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.280]   We'll be in tonight, yeah.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.840]   So the big story, I don't need to say it.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   I mean, it's probably the tech news story of the summer.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.680]   Broke early on Monday.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.600]   So early, we didn't even get to do a breaking news feed of it.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.040]   It just happened like out of nowhere.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.360]   Larry Page holds a phone call and says,
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.000]   we bought Motorola for $12.5 billion.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.080]   We should be specific Motorola mobility, which
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.320]   is the cell phone division of Motorola.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.520]   But that does include, does it not the set top boxes?
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.320]   Yes.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.880]   Yes.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   And that's-- you know, I mean, a lot of coverage
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.920]   over the patents.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.920]   They acquired, in this purchase, 7,500 patents.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.520]   Something like that?
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.360]   $24,500 patents and applications across both areas.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.080]   $20?
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.880]   Well, that's a difference.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.040]   $400,000 per patent.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.120]   Holy cow.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.400]   But well worth it, because it gave patent portfolio--
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.000]   Google, Ohio, only had 1,000 prior to this.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.640]   It gave them a patent portfolio to defend themselves
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.640]   against Microsoft and Apple's Nortel patents, among others.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.520]   Although Motorola was doing some saber rattling of its own,
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.360]   threatening to sue other people last months.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.200]   And I know they've been kind of-- people
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.480]   have been talked about suing them.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.440]   So does this get Google off the hook,
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.680]   or does it just make them a bigger target?
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.080]   I think it gets them off the hook.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.560]   The way I--
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.280]   You wrote a great piece on this, Jeff, actually.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.280]   Well, thanks.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.480]   As a delicate-- as I say anything,
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.680]   I said that it's really lawyer repellent,
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.000]   or if you prefer rat poison.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.240]   Because I think that if you look at the fact
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.680]   that they got HTC, LG, and Sony Ericsson
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.320]   to say the same PR statement supporting this,
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.760]   it's about protecting the ecosystem of Android.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.480]   And yes, Motorola was going to start suing them.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.800]   It's now not going to.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.240]   They have mud balls to fly back to Apple and Nokia
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.400]   and Microsoft and company.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.080]   And--
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.680]   This thing that we call mutually assured destruction
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.000]   in the patent wars.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.600]   Right.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.160]   And you know, it's what I said too is,
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.040]   I think it's a tragedy and a pity that this much capital, $12
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.560]   and 1/2 billion here, $5 billion for the Nortell deal,
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.160]   did not go to investment, to innovation, to creation,
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.360]   to employment.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.000]   It went to fending off lawyers in patent deals.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.280]   But fine if it finds a way for some peace
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.800]   and if we can move ahead with innovation.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.200]   And what I imagine, what I hope for,
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.560]   is that there may be other companies
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.040]   that were waiting in the wings afraid to touch Android,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.080]   because they were too small.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.760]   You know, the fabled I fridge, right?
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.400]   The connected refrigerator or the connected TVs
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.360]   or new connected cars and all kinds of things
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.320]   that can now use Android with more safety.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.960]   That's my hope is, is that having this open system.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.720]   Now, of course, the problem--
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.880]   the irony of this is, is that Google
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.560]   has to compete with its own suppliers.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.720]   This forced it into channel conflict.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.400]   Larry Page said that Motorola will be operated separately,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.480]   though they had a Motorola, so they're going to integrate.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.440]   But I think I believe Larry.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.680]   They're assuring the other members of the ecosystem
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.440]   that this is about protecting Android.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.320]   And I think that's obviously got to be the case.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.240]   I think the Wall Street analysts who've been disneying this,
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.120]   thinking that Google's and the phone business
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.560]   are utter friggin' idiots who don't get what really happened
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.120]   here.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.160]   And finally, my hope is that maybe with Google involved,
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.720]   we could finally fix the worst computers on Earth, otherwise
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.160]   known as cable set-top boxes.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.720]   Right.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.360]   Well, of course, they got that patent benefit,
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.800]   but it's not mutually exclusive.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.440]   It could be that Google does want to.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.840]   They have always done deals.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.040]   First, they did them with HTC, and then later with Samsung
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.240]   to make vanilla Google phones.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.520]   I presume now that the Droid line, the Motorola Droid line,
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.680]   will become a vanilla Google phone.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.520]   So they are in the handset business, I would guess.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.320]   Yes, but can you imagine a scenario
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.880]   where they get out of that business,
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.920]   where they slough parts of that off?
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.680]   They don't need to be.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.760]   That's what you're saying.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.400]   They don't need to be.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.520]   And even if anti-trust problems come, they're fine.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.000]   We'll get rid of that.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.640]   But what was they just running as a separate division?
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.480]   Yeah, they can.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.280]   But as someone said, some analysts said at some point
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.320]   that even if they did that, the patents are stored cheap.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.600]   Are you Kevin Marks reassured by the partners, Samsung, HTC, LG,
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.080]   saying, oh, this is fine, this is good, we're not worried.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.040]   Or do you think that's lip service in there watching
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.240]   with narrowed eyes to see what Google does next?
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.880]   I think it's both.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.920]   I think they are reassured because this patent thing
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.400]   was a mess.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.360]   They're all being sued by Apple and Microsoft
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.640]   and everyone else as well.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.000]   Samsung's got to be thrilled.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.160]   Jeff's writing, there's a rat's nest of lawsuits
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.000]   around this as well.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.560]   If you look at the graph of who's suing whom,
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.920]   it is ridiculous.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:43.680]   So I think Google historically has been good about using
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.560]   patents defensively and clearly do want the Android ecosystem
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.240]   to succeed.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.360]   They have more invested in that, in its exceedingly
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.480]   than anyone else.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.800]   So I should think there's a fair bit of honesty in that.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.720]   It's like good.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.880]   We don't actually have to pay Bulma's blackmail
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.720]   to make Android devices anymore.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.640]   If we can get to that, that'd be great.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.000]   That was the piece that they're all we feeling.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.120]   Yeah, there'd be some concern about Google owning
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.720]   a potential manufacturing competitor.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.360]   But one thing that Google has done historically with Android
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.600]   is for each release, they've worked with one manufacturer
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.880]   to build the exemplar for that release.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.720]   If you think back, they did it with Motorola
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.520]   with the first Droid.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.880]   That was the one that they said, OK,
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.800]   this release of Android is going out on this phone.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.600]   This is the exciting new phone you.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.440]   And we'll do that.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.960]   And they did one with HTC and they've done it with the others.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.640]   And they've been rotating through that.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.400]   They may need to rethink that and be a bit more even
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.520]   handed about that and release multiple in one go.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.480]   But I would think that that would be good for the ecosystem
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.520]   as well.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.960]   The other piece of this is, as I spoke about this before
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.080]   in January, is that there are actually two bits to Android.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.880]   There's the open source bit, which is everywhere.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.440]   It's literally on all kinds of devices.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.120]   And no company is too small to use that.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.800]   And a lot of the weird Chinese consumer electronics
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.320]   companies that are expected to be making random devices
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.960]   that you buy in Kmart or Walmart are becoming Android devices
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.280]   because it's easier than writing their own firmware.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.920]   And that piece is still going to carry on.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.360]   And they're much less worried about lawsuits in that realm
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.440]   because they tend to be small companies that they can fold up
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.640]   and throw away if something happens.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.280]   But the other piece is the with Google part of Android.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.360]   If you look on any of the mainstream Android phones
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.200]   somewhere on the back, it says with Google, which means
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.920]   they've signed an agreement with Google that lets them have
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.680]   maps and Gmail and the Android market and a whole bunch
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.480]   of other bits and pieces.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.760]   And that's the piece that Google has used as a licensing
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.680]   control to say you have to conform to certain things
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.680]   to be an Android phone.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.080]   That's been their hook up to now.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.560]   So there's already been this bipartite model for Android.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.440]   And I think that will continue.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.880]   The patent protections that apply to both halves of that.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   But it may be that they'll adjust the way
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.960]   that they do business with that.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   But if they've already got an objective standard,
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.400]   you have to agree to to be an Android licensee,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.280]   they can use that as the wall between them and much
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.120]   road if they want to as well.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.240]   And I put a document up on the--
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.640]   sorry, Gina, but before you get a chance--
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.520]   with a paragraph with details on the patents.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:30.440]   What's your sense, though, of the risk involved here?
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.800]   Standard and poor, downgraded-- in fact,
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   they made a sell recommendation on Google's stock.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.320]   Saying their analysts said that they weren't sure
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.200]   if the patents would help protect Android or Google.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.760]   There's also the issue of they paid $12.5 billion.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.080]   Now, Google had more than $30 billion in cash
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.200]   so they could afford it.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.760]   But it is more than two years worth of Google revenue combined
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.360]   for $12.5.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.840]   Was it in stock or in cash?
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.640]   I didn't see that.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.800]   I didn't see that either.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.200]   I believe it's cash.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.560]   It's actually cash.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.200]   I believe so.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.760]   That's weird.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.320]   Because I would think they would do an acquisition most
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.120]   in stock.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.080]   Oh, it's a hell of a deal for Motorola shareholders.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.880]   Who just got rescued?
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.480]   And let's point out, Motorola, the mobility division,
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.000]   had not been profitable for a while.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   In fact, for a while, they gave up cell phones entirely.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.080]   They had a net loss for the second quarter
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.960]   of this year of $56 million.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.280]   This is not a healthy company they're buying,
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.840]   which does kind of confirm the belief
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.640]   that well, they're buying them for the patents alone.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.120]   Well, yeah.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.120]   I mean, let's note that S&P downgraded America
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.480]   and what do people have to buy next?
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.520]   Peabills.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.560]   Let's take all of our money.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.720]   S&P value, chug up.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.160]   It could be please, you know, pick at S&P
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.680]   as a bunch of bloody idiots.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.680]   OK.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.680]   Anyway.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.800]   Well, I think what they're saying is not unreasonable.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.840]   I mean, looking at the balance sheet alone, it's a fairly--
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.040]   I think even Google must agree.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.320]   This is a fairly risky thing.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.920]   This isn't like a no-brainer for me.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.400]   OK.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.960]   But Leo, by that account, of course,
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.920]   then Google's stock should have created with YouTube.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   Right.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.040]   Well, in hindsight, it probably should have.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.680]   Well, yes or no, but it was a turnout.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.280]   No, but--
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.120]   And it was only three or four billion, right?
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.000]   Not 12 and a half billion dollars.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.680]   It was 600 million.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.680]   Right.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.680]   And it was 600 million.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.960]   They got a lawsuit instead.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.960]   I think it's--
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.480]   Is it the case that because Google lost the Nortell patents
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.440]   to Microsoft Apple and that consortium,
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.480]   that-- do you think that this deal was in process
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.760]   at that point, or that they-- this happened five weeks ago,
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.960]   that they scrambled in those five weeks and said, quick,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.960]   we need to set-- we'd play on B.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960]   Gee, did they have--
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.280]   Supposedly bidding as well.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:38.840]   Right.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.600]   That was one story was that-- I think it was a malach
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.880]   story was that Microsoft had been eyeing Motorola.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.360]   Boy, that would really put the screws on Google
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.360]   to do something, because if Microsoft has Nortell and Motorola--
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:51.760]   Right.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.520]   And basically it has Nokia as well.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.680]   And Nokia.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:55.680]   And that's right.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.600]   Good news.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.160]   So the other thing that a couple of commentators
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.400]   pointed out is that Motorola has a Java license,
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.480]   historically, if they've done it for their phones,
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.720]   which Google hasn't up to now.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   So this may be your--
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.480]   That's a miracle problem.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.600]   The Oracle problem as well, if they can--
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.120]   Wow.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.160]   --convey that one correctly.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.360]   That may also has a transnational--
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.080]   --transnational suit, communication.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.120]   I want to know why none of us saw this coming.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.280]   Why didn't anybody-- why did no tech journalist say, hey,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.840]   you know what?
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.040]   He was a great Monday morning.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.400]   It was such a good bombshell, right?
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.800]   It was like this new graph that I was just like, what?
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.640]   I know that this is mostly about the patents.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.160]   And I know that it's about protecting Android and all that.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.880]   But I'm still really--
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.760]   or wondering, I'm excited about what this
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.160]   is going to mean for consumers.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.960]   I mean, my first reaction was like, I cannot wait
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.160]   to see what the next--
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.660]   Yes.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.660]   --your Google experience phone is going to be.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.720]   And no doubt it's going to be a Motorola phone or Google
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.520]   Rolophone.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.160]   But that's apparently not necessarily the case.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.240]   Google's still going to have different manufacturers bid
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.920]   on the next-- next is phone.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.520]   And they're going to choose the best one.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.320]   And I understand they need to put up this wall.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.080]   They don't want to scare off their other--
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.600]   Samsung and HT and all those other guys.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.560]   But I have to tell you, I really would
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.400]   like to see Google get involved-- closely involved--
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.320]   with Motorola, whoever is being operated,
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.360]   and make just awesome, awesome phones.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.060]   And Google TV units.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.660]   And I'm going to tell you, I'd like
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.060]   to see them tighten the clamps on what they put that by Google
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.220]   or with Google Stamp on.
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.660]   I'd like to see them say things like,
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.940]   we're going to standardize the order of the buttons on the phone.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.460]   Yes.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:26.940]   Thank you.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.820]   And search the buttons.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.060]   I would like to see them say, no, you're
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.780]   not going to ship Android phones with crapware pre-installed
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.420]   that users cannot uninstall.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.500]   If you're going to do that, you're
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.660]   not going to use the Google name.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.860]   I'd like to see them take a little more control
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.460]   and raise the bar for what a great Android phone experience is.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.460]   Because I mean, I've only had--
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.260]   You know what they should do if they really wanted to go crazy
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.660]   is buy sprint.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:48.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.660]   Well, that was--
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.160]   That was--
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.360]   I'm rooting for it.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.660]   I would love to see that.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.160]   Genital--
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.560]   Yes, you're the one day was saying that Apple should buy T-Mobile.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.360]   And I also said, but maybe it would make more sense
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.860]   for Google to buy them, which is partly just keep them away
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.960]   from AT&T was--
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.160]   But then the regulators really get involved.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:05.760]   Because then--
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.560]   We'll get Google closer to Germany, which is a good thing.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.960]   Genital, let me ask you a question here.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.060]   So I agree with you.
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.860]   One of the commenters I said also said
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.020]   that you've got a lot of engineers on the hardware
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.460]   side at Motorola.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.900]   What struck me is interesting here
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.860]   is that those people could inform the design of Android
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.060]   to really well to find closer ties in between hardware
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.860]   and the operating system.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.460]   And the irony to me is that probably
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.260]   wouldn't be done for Motorola's benefit,
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.760]   because what's more valuable here is Android.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.160]   That the proprietary engineering in Motorola
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.960]   could end up becoming more open through Android.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.060]   Does it make any sense?
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.660]   Yeah, that just makes sense.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.360]   Yeah, I do think that makes sense.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.560]   I mean, if you have more communication between the software
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.760]   people, the software engineers and the hardware engineers,
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.260]   if that's great for everyone, that means better phones.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.560]   And if they can make more information public,
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.060]   or if they can collaborate more closely,
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.460]   that could be better for everyone.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.060]   I mean, I got this sticky wicket.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.260]   That's also the thing that all Samsung and HTC
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.160]   are worried about, right?
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.960]   That Motorola is going to have access to maybe hidden APIs
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   or information sooner than other suppliers.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.860]   I mean, it gets weird.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.360]   But I have to tell you, I think the consumer
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.160]   is the most important thing.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.460]   I want to see a great Android phone on the market,
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.860]   not the Nexus 1 or the Nexus S, where only nerds with a lot
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:21.660]   of money have it, right?
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.160]   I want--
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.260]   --A droid ex or something like that.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.460]   I thought the droid ex was a great handset.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:27.960]   But--
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.060]   And the chatroom's saying this, thank God,
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.360]   we can kill Moto Blur.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:32.860]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.960]   Which is their sugar on top of Android.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.360]   And it's--
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.460]   Or I mean, the devil's advocate for a second here.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.460]   Because I'm polyoptimist all the time,
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.360]   so I agree with everything we've said.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.060]   Now, on the other hand, what happened
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.660]   when Google got close to phone companies
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.260]   in its business by necessity?
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.160]   It did the devil's deal with Verizon deal, yeah.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.760]   So on the one hand, we might be thinking,
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.660]   ooh, the world's best phone, cheaper free.
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.060]   This is wonderful.
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.360]   But then it's only going to piss off its own manufacturers
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.460]   even more.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.160]   Because now it's in channel conflict.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.960]   So could this, in fact, put Google more
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.560]   on the side of the hardware manufacturers
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.660]   like the phone companies against us, the consumers?
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.760]   That's the devil speaking.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.260]   Mm.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.460]   I'd be surprised.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.260]   I think--
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.860]   --I'd be sad.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.560]   I think Google knows how to do this.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.460]   I know they can--
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.460]   --they know how to build a firewall.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.260]   --they know how to build a firewall.
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.560]   But that's the other side of this.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:30.660]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.060]   They've said, OK, you know, if you look at how
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.260]   they've done previous releases,
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.660]   they've said, OK, we'll work with one of you
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.060]   to build the reference one.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.360]   And they rotate through different manufacturers
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:40.860]   and done that.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.260]   And that has been a reasonably successful thing to do.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.060]   And I think, yeah, as Gina says,
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.960]   they could use this to encourage more.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.060]   They could also bring some of the hardware engineering things
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.860]   and bring that out more publicly.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.860]   Somebody said--
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.460]   --I think the set-top box piece is also a fascinating--
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.360]   Well, I want to get to that.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.660]   Let's-- in a second.
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.660]   But we-- because there's definitely something there.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.260]   But I want to finish the phone conversation.
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.740]   Somebody said, there were a couple of other stories
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.560]   talking about HD Android phones coming.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.980]   Venture Beat and Giga Room.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.060]   We're talking about that today.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.820]   Saying that they've got larger HD screens showing up
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.260]   that are actually--
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.660]   --red-night, 4-bit display style.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.660]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.260]   You tried the 3D phone.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:20.660]   That makes no sense.
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.660]   That was terrible.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.660]   And I have seen it.
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.460]   That makes sense.
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.540]   But one of the reasons I liked the droid in the first place
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.300]   was that it had a very high pixel density before Apple
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.860]   made-- you know, gave that a name, called it Red in the Display.
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.420]   This is like 256.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.620]   If you take that same density and add more pixels,
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.820]   you end up with something that's closer to the--
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.980]   those are the-- what do you call--
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.380]   --the Evo androids.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.020]   But actually, this is 854 by 480.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.180]   If you grow that up to 184 by 720,
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.740]   you get something that's about the size of those Evos,
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.140]   but actually is a full HD screen and is closer to an iPad
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.780]   in terms of number of pixels.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.420]   And that-- I think that's an enhancement.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.860]   I think having more pixels in smaller spaces is always good.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.780]   And I'm sure Apple will be going there soon, too.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.300]   But the competition is good.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.300]   We want this competition.
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.420]   Of course, it was good.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:17.180]   And I think as the hiding comb and ice cream sandwich releases
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.380]   come out and the sort of the higher definition UI
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.940]   starts making more sense, that will make sense
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.020]   in these smaller form factors as well.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.140]   That's something I do like about the Galaxy 10.1.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.460]   Is that that UX actually does make much sense
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.420]   and makes good use of those extra pixels?
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.020]   All right.
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.100]   I think-- I had some other questions,
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.980]   but I think we're going to take a break and come back
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.980]   and talk more about this acquisition in terms
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.580]   of the set top boxes, because I think it does impact Google TV.
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.740]   I was just looking through Google acquisitions.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.180]   Clearly, this is the largest ever.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.180]   The next biggest ever was double click.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.180]   So you go from-- this is a mashable list--
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:01.660]   $12.5 billion for Motorola mobility, $3.1 billion--
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.820]   $1.25 that size for double click.
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.100]   That was just last year.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.180]   Actually, no, 2007.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.540]   YouTube was $1.6 billion.
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.540]   Oh, OK, wrong one.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.100]   $750,000 for AdMob.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.500]   The ITA acquisition, which I still think hasn't gone through.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.660]   Has it been approved yet?
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.740]   $700 million.
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.180]   I know that the regulators were concerned about that.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.180]   So this is a massive bet on Google's part,
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.860]   an expensive--
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.300]   I suppose, I mean, you could express those as fractions
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.820]   of cash on hand or fractions of market cap.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.340]   That's true.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.820]   Doing them in ROI as a bit strange when Google is worth
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.420]   a lot more now than it was when you choose.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.860]   Yeah, and in that respect, they could certainly afford it.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.340]   Well, we don't want to really sell this.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.980]   $2.5 billion break up fee, which is outrageous.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.900]   Will there be regulator issues with this acquisition?
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.300]   I guess I suppose it has to be approved, right?
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.020]   Yeah, anything involving Google now
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.060]   is going to be a hot button.
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.340]   But it's hard to see-- it's not like there's no monopoly
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:00.500]   here.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.580]   There's no competition.
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.580]   Yep.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.060]   You know--
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.820]   Is it, though, a little bit like the movie companies owning
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.020]   their distribution, the movie theaters,
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.260]   is a little bit like--
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.220]   I think it'd be more so, Leo, if they bought the phone
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.220]   company.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.100]   Well, that-- you know, I was joking.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.660]   There's no way.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.260]   I wish they could buy Sprint, but there's no way.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.340]   I think in this case, they're going to say--
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.460]   what are they going to say to the regulators?
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.140]   They're going to say Android is open.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.300]   We license it freely.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.580]   We will not restrict it to any manufacturer.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.860]   They may get some covenants, though, that they, for instance,
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.180]   can't stop doing that.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.580]   You know, what are they going to say?
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.580]   Hey, you want us to?
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.140]   Will I send it to Apple?
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:34.740]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.940]   We love it.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.300]   Somebody said-- and I think this is true-- that Google's
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.060]   learning the lesson that Microsoft's learned that you can't
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.140]   just make the operating system.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.780]   You have to have a hardware partner, Microsoft Nokia,
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.540]   Google Motorola.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.140]   Is that the case?
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.940]   You can't just be an OS company.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.380]   I'm not buying that argument.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.140]   There's Apple, Envy is an argument out there.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.060]   And I'm not buying that one.
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.780]   I think this is a necessity they had to get to.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.780]   But that's why I say that if they got rid of the hardware,
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.140]   it wouldn't hurt them.
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.180]   I don't mean Envy.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.140]   I mean, merely that the economics of it
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.700]   are that you have to make a handset.
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.620]   No, because that's not the Google strategy.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.380]   Eric Schmidt has expressed the Google strategy clearly.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.180]   And that's what this really indicates,
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.180]   is the solidity of the strategy, which is that mobile.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:19.900]   He said late last year that every single strategic goal
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.340]   for Google next year was mobile.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.500]   He said a year before that that the strategy for mobile
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.020]   is to have the operating system that's on more devices,
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.300]   thus attracting more developers, thus more apps,
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.020]   thus more users, thus more value.
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.020]   Could they then spin off the hardware?
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:34.620]   Or--
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.020]   Yes.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.740]   And just say what we got was patents.
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.380]   That's what we wanted.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.980]   We wanted an unencumbered Android, or at least a somewhat
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.540]   defended Android.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.500]   And now we're happy.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:43.940]   It's worth 12 times.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.340]   And there's an argument that the patents would then
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.420]   be free, that they could get enough value out
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.300]   of Motorola hardware manufacturing, open it up,
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.540]   give it permanent, absolutely free license to every patent
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.900]   that there is, and the defense around that,
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.900]   spin that off to something else.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.700]   And the patents that they just paid a fortune, $400,000 each
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.500]   for could be end up being basically free.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.060]   I like that idea.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.100]   Let's take a break.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.580]   We're going to come back and talk about the set top box,
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.260]   and then a new job for cyanogen.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.580]   I'm going to ask a gene about that one.
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.620]   Before we do that, I want to talk about Squarespace.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.060]   The secret behind exceptional websites, all of you,
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.220]   know that if you don't have a website,
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.620]   you don't have a presence in the world nowadays.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.060]   If you're a business without a website,
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:34.100]   it's like a business without a phone 30 years ago.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.980]   You've got to have one so that clients and customers,
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.660]   and people who care about you, can find you.
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.300]   Squarespace is a great way to make a website.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.380]   Even if you have no experience, you've never done design
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.380]   before, you don't know any.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.660]   You don't know CSS from JavaScript,
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.060]   from a hole in the ground.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.900]   Squarespace.com, give it a try right now.
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.300]   If you go to squarespace.com and click the try it free button,
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.060]   you'll see how easy it is to set up a site.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.860]   We set up a site on Twit, and we had people designing it
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.940]   before the show was over.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:02.780]   What was the name?
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.620]   I wonder if that site--
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.460]   - Oh, that was funny.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.300]   That was funny.
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.140]   What was that?
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.220]   - What was the name of this?
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.740]   - Twit cupcakes.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.580]   - Twit cupcakes?
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.780]   - Yes.
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.420]   - Twit cupcakes.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.220]   - That's squarespace.com, was that it?
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.060]   Let me see if the chat remembers.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.940]   I don't want to go to some random site.
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.740]   And I remember the password was, "Om is hungry."
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.380]   And if somebody tried to change it, I changed it back.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.540]   Why public sites are a bad idea?
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.540]   I don't think that's--
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.740]   Maybe that is it.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.940]   - Maybe that is it.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.620]   Somebody taught you to talk to somebody.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.300]   - Oh, you know who got there?
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.580]   Look at-- it says, "Remember, remember the fifth of November.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.140]   V has been here."
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.780]   Look at that.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.620]   But that wasn't so impressive.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.540]   OK, that's why public sites are a bad idea.
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.220]   OK, so don't give away your password.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.380]   Just do it yourself.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.300]   But it did show you how easy it was to do.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:52.980]   Create the site.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.940]   All you need is a name, a password, an email address.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.580]   And then you can do everything you could
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.660]   do on squarespace yourself, including the templates that
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.860]   aren't templated-- 60 plus designer styles that look great.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.900]   And you can modify to your heart's content
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.300]   without any knowledge of CSS, just using a mouse,
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.420]   drag, and drop point and click.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.140]   But if you know CSS, of course, you could do that too.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.780]   That's actually nice, because it means you could take your
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.340]   existing site, use the CSS there, the style sheets there,
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.140]   and make the squarespace site look the same.
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.780]   Furthermore, you can use their import tool to get the data
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.900]   out of your existing site.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.940]   And I don't mean just the posts.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.500]   I mean, the links, they stay the same.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.700]   Your SEO stays the same.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.260]   Your image is transfer over.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.940]   Even your comments transfer over.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.100]   From all the big APIs-- WordPress, movable type,
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.940]   blogger, type pad.
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.980]   Just really sweet.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.460]   And every import has an export.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.300]   Kind of true to the Google Data Liberation Front motto.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.660]   You've never trapped at a squarespace site.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.580]   You're never going to want to leave, though, because you get
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.020]   the best hosting, the best software, always up to date.
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.220]   When version 6 comes out, you're going to flip your lid,
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:03.060]   great content, or stats, so you know exactly what your
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.220]   visitors are looking at.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.220]   Look, you've got to try it free.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.180]   squarespace.com, click the try it free button.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.660]   If you decide to buy, this is where we come in.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:16.780]   Our offer code is Twig and the number 8, one word, TWIG8.
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:21.980]   Sites as low as $10.67 a month, but you'll save 10% off
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.660]   for the next six months when you use the offer code Twig8
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.020]   Squarespace.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.540]   The secret behind exceptional websites-- take a look at
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.500]   our Insight Twit blog.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.780]   It's one of our Squarespace site.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.260]   We just love it.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.260]   Ah.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:36.620]   All right.
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.620]   Let's talk a little bit about the set-top boxes you wanted
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:39.740]   to get into that.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.580]   I know Kevin Marks.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.300]   Motorola Mobility also is one of the two--
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.700]   there's scientific Atlanta, and there's Motorola, the big
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.180]   set-top box manufacturers.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.300]   Many, many, many people who have cable boxes have
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.340]   Motorola cable boxes.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.900]   They're crappy.
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.500]   Nobody denies that.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.740]   They're underpowered.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.260]   They couldn't run Google TV if they tried.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:01.860]   But it does give--
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.780]   They're power-up hogs.
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.260]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.020]   But it does give Google a-- or does it--
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.980]   a foot into this market.
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.580]   It gives them a supply chain foot.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.340]   I mean, also, a lot of the reasons those boxes are crap
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.100]   is not so much the hardware as the software they're running
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.180]   on written by cable companies.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.740]   True.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.820]   And that was the whole point of the--
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.300]   But they are underpowered.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.580]   I mean, I know Microsoft really wanted to get it to the
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.020]   set-top box business, and really wanted Microsoft software
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.260]   to be on those boxes, and couldn't because the economics
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.460]   of it were, you can't put enough of a processor in there to
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.180]   run a real operating system.
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:33.820]   Well, that's what it is.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.420]   It's true anymore.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.220]   I mean, that was the--
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.980]   this has been true from the '80s.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.020]   When I was at Apple, there was a project--
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:41.860]   Apple wanted to do it.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.220]   That's right.
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.860]   Quick time on a set-top box in wherever that was in the late
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.060]   '90s.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.260]   There was a whole bunch of attempts at this.
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.420]   But cable operators didn't want it.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.100]   Yeah, the problem is the cable operator is the ones who
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.780]   are holding the chain there.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.140]   And that's the difficult part.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.540]   And that's what happened to the Google TV.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.420]   They were the ones who shut that down.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:00.860]   Right.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.660]   Do you make a Motorola brand at Google TV now?
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.140]   Yes.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.420]   Yes, I'm not.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.100]   The question is what a cable operator distributed.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:12.900]   Right.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.300]   Because the challenge with Google TV was they were saying
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.740]   that it was going around them.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.420]   Apple TV does that, too.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.620]   But Apple gets away with that because their primary use is
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.740]   on other devices.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.740]   Whereas the Google TV was seen as a direct threat to their
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:29.420]   control of the channel.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:35.180]   But does Motorola have relationships or distribution
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.940]   channels that Google could take?
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:37.540]   I'm not sure.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:37.940]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.340]   I'm not really sure how this all works with the relationships
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.420]   and who determines what.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:44.140]   But it seems like this is an obvious put in the door
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.060]   for Google TV.
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.980]   They're going to at least try something with Google TV.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:48.500]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.180]   It would think it makes sense.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:50.700]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.060]   They've got the conversation.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.020]   But I imagine the way it works is that Motorola goes to
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.340]   Comcast and says, you know,
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.820]   they bid it out and we'll give you 100,000, you know,
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.860]   set top boxes for $15 each.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.740]   I know the cost is really, really low.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.340]   And the cable operators say, OK, but I think you're right.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.580]   I think it's not merely that it has to be cheap hardware.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.980]   It also has to support their business model, which Google
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.620]   really doesn't have much interest in doing.
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:20.900]   Right.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.300]   And what they value is control.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.020]   That's why they want to own the box,
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:28.420]   put only the authorized box on there.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.260]   So maybe this is another part they spin off.
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.660]   Boy, it would be nice to have a nice box.
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.140]   We can, but dream.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.340]   Gina, have you fired your Google TV up in the last six
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.780]   months I haven't?
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.900]   I use it.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:42.700]   I use it all the time.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:43.020]   Do you use it?
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:43.660]   Yes, my means.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.500]   That's how I use it.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.340]   I totally use it.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.940]   I really like having a--
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:47.900]   So is it much better?
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.060]   Because I keep thinking, oh, I should connect it up
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.260]   and get the update and see if it's better.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.180]   No, it's not much better.
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.260]   I have to have the market yet.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.060]   So when it gets the market, do that.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.300]   When it gets the market, do that.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.340]   Well, as soon as it gets the market, are you kidding?
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.180]   I'm going to flip my lid.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.540]   I'm going to go there immediately.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.780]   Yeah, I don't know what's holding that up.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.500]   What could be--
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.420]   Yeah, and it's supposed to be this month or next month.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.020]   I mean, it's supposed to be late summer.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.020]   So soon.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.380]   So when that happens, I'll let you know later.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.620]   You should definitely look it up.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.580]   I really like it.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.260]   I watch weird flash streams.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.660]   And I love--
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.180]   I love--
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.820]   It's sitting in my TV--
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:19.900]   you know, my TV's here.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.260]   And then I got the cupboard with the Apple TV
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.100]   and the Roku box and the cable box and the every this
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.820]   and that and Xbox 360 and the place.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.300]   All the stuff under there.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.460]   The problem is really I only have seven HDMI ports
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.220]   and I have like eight devices.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:37.020]   So the Google TV is sitting there, not connected.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.620]   And all I have to do is plug it in.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.260]   I'll have to figure out which to unplug.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.420]   Probably the Apple TV.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.620]   I don't ever use that.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.740]   And I'm ready to go.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.540]   So if I could book market on there,
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.940]   I just think of all the stuff that basically put all the Android
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.260]   apps--
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.940]   apps.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.740]   Sorry.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.460]   What's happening?
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.860]   What's happening over there?
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.500]   Sorry.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.740]   Change your TV on.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.340]   There we go.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.020]   Turn on your Google TV.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.100]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:03.300]   Right.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.740]   I turned on the Google TV and everything just went to hell.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.220]   Sorry.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.220]   Back now.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.700]   But do they have-- so part of the issue with the Google TV
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.260]   was all the networks got them off.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.820]   Hulu plus work on it?
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:15.340]   No.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:15.860]   No.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.060]   Who's talking to everything soon?
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:18.860]   That's true.
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.660]   Hulu's kind of almost out of business, aren't they?
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.020]   Ah, yep.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:22.220]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.340]   The major networks don't work like ABC.com
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.820]   or you're not going to catch the bachelor or anything on it.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.980]   But I really like being able to search.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.940]   I really like being able to check Twitter and search
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.140]   or watch Twitter streams while I'm watching a live event.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.260]   And I just like being able to Google stuff from my--
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:38.860]   on my machine.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.340]   I think that having a browser on the TV
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.780]   has sort of been an underrated concept.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.700]   But that said, wait for the update.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.220]   Go ahead.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.100]   And then fire up.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.100]   Once it gets to the market, I think that'll be a big deal.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:47.700]   We need apps.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.340]   More apps, for sure.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.740]   When I like the idea of a search box on the TV,
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.260]   which is basically what the point--
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.380]   that was the high concept there.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.420]   And certainly my Comcast remote has more buttons
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.860]   than a keyboard already.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.420]   And they're less than a keyboard.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.220]   That's a good point.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.860]   At least the keyboard is stepping in.
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.740]   And I don't understand what that is.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.940]   The thing that Apple has done so nicely
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.580]   with the iPads and the iPhone and the Apple TVs
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.620]   of moving stuff seamlessly between them.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.660]   So you can--
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.620]   But that's just rebranded DLNA.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.660]   You could do that.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.740]   Android supports it.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.500]   Yeah, except if you've tried using DLNA,
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.740]   like I got 12 steps into the process and gave up.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.300]   The Apple one actually said, OK, we
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.900]   can integrate this stuff and make it actually.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:28.940]   There's an airplane menu.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.420]   You select the device.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.020]   You click it and it starts playing.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.740]   And you can remote control it, which is great.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.820]   So I've lost three Apple remotes somewhere in the living
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.140]   already because it's damn easy.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:37.740]   Too small.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.420]   My secret with Apple remotes is the same secret
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.300]   I have for fountain pens.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.460]   You just keep-- and nail clippers.
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.380]   Just keep buying them.
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.700]   So the space is so saturated with remotes
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.700]   that it'll be somewhere.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.020]   And they're cheap enough and small enough, it's easy to do.
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.980]   I like those new aluminum ones.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.580]   All right, so I have a--
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.380]   Say again?
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:57.940]   Just one.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.540]   Kevin, you're right.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.260]   Having a search engine on the TV is exactly what we want.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.660]   But that is precisely what this intermediates the cable
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.700]   model of giving you curated channels that you don't want.
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:13.020]   So there's a business deal that needs to be done there.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.660]   The business piece is the hard piece.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.100]   They have the text there.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.020]   The other thing to think about this
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.900]   is the moving between screen stuff, which is--
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.980]   in some ways, it's obvious.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.300]   Microsoft's been talking about three screens for a long time.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.980]   But the other thing is if you've got one of these here,
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.660]   that's the same number of pixels per radian
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.180]   as the television is across the room.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.260]   And as the laptop is at that distance.
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.980]   So as these devices get high density screens,
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.060]   they're effectively the same resolution as the TV.
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.380]   So you don't buy the distinction between sit back
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:46.100]   and lean forward.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.780]   Do you think it's all really the same?
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.020]   Just depending on how close it is.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.940]   It depends on how you use it.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.980]   I think that it's changing.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.020]   I found that--
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.700]   That's to me the problem with Google TV in a nutshell
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.620]   is that I have a sit back experience for a TV.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:01.940]   You just sit back and watch it.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.220]   And the keyboard and mouse requires a lean forward interface.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:06.740]   Right.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.220]   But if you've got a thing in your hand
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.380]   that you're used to--
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.100]   --instead of your remote control, you've got something like this.
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.460]   Do you use a tab or do you use the phone?
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:16.980]   For the--
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.820]   There's a Galaxy tab interface too, I think.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.660]   For the Apple TV?
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.300]   No, no, no.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.340]   For the Google TV.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:22.700]   That's right.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.700]   You use the Apple TV.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.980]   I never got into that change.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.060]   Save 300 bucks.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.340]   I used the Apple one.
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:28.860]   Thank you.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.340]   Now it's 99.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.420]   But Gina and I didn't-- wait, till it was 90.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.140]   But I've also used Double Twist on the phone
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.620]   and on the thing to send stuff to Apple TV.
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.940]   Because they reverse engine in the protocol.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.820]   So my Android device can send stuff to that as well.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:47.180]   So that-- that I found useful too.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:53.820]   But the real-- so what I was getting at with these devices
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.020]   actually becoming, replacing all the other remote controls
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:57.820]   and devices.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.980]   At first, it seems ridiculous because these things
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.380]   are far more expensive.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.500]   But that is how you get around that problem of the stuff
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.020]   you get from the cable company has to be cheap and crappy.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.220]   Because they're making low marches on it.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.340]   If you're already carrying a device that costs 10 times as
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.340]   much but has downloadable software,
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.220]   then that's what you can do.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.460]   And that's what Apple has clearly done well with the Apple
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.820]   TV integration with the other devices.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.220]   And it's there for the taking with Android and these other
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.980]   devices too.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.020]   If they can get those sort of business deals
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.180]   and the coordination together.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.980]   And that may be the piece that they can sell to the cable
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:32.700]   companies.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.540]   Because they're going to be seeing the pressure from
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.220]   that respect.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.940]   But once again, and I'm not saying this is going to happen,
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:38.980]   and I have some faith at Google.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.140]   Because I am the Google fanboy.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.300]   But if you're going to look at devil scenarios, the closer
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.540]   Google gets to business with evil cable companies, like
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:52.140]   evil phone companies and somewhat evil manufacturers,
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:52.940]   the worse off we are.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:57.900]   So at some point, if a major customer or Motorola's is
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.700]   cable companies.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.580]   And so I'm a little nervous.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.300]   And you hit the nail on the head when you said that every
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.860]   time they do this, we feel like Google's going to
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.900]   zig in our favor.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.100]   And they zag in the company's favor.
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:13.740]   Right.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:13.900]   Right.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.580]   And what's their line is that they're making
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.060]   compromised to make it or small changes, right?
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.380]   Get their foot in the--
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.380]   All right, all right.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.140]   I won't defend.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.060]   I won't defend it.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.060]   All right, all right.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.780]   Sorry, I didn't mean to cough indeed.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.620]   I'm looking at the--
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.980]   is this the link you sent me the approach to innovation
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.060]   about Motorola?
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.340]   Or just has the list of you going to the company?
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.140]   Leveraging along history and building for the future.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.940]   This sounds like a new screen.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:44.220]   As of January 2011, Motorola loan 25,000 patents and patent
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.140]   applications worldwide.
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.580]   That's a lot.
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.100]   It's a whole lot.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.660]   Mobile devices business segment has 14,600 granted patents.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:59.060]   Another 6,700 pending, including 2G, 3G, 4G, H.26--
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.620]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.340]   H.264 and MPEG-4--
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.460]   Patterns in them.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.100]   That's intriguing because, of course, remember, it's
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:11.620]   MPEG-LA claiming that WebM is encumbered.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:15.740]   Google may have gotten more than just telephony patents here.
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.340]   802.11, Open Mobile Alliance.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.780]   And as you mentioned, near field communications patents.
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.740]   Boy, I tell you, I think the tech press really
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.140]   wasn't playing attention.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.420]   We should have caught this.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.420]   If it hadn't been August, I think we would have caught this
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.460]   and said, you know, I think Google should buy Motorola.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.140]   This looks like the right move if what you want to do
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.820]   is build a patent defense.
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.100]   A better move than nortel.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.020]   Much better.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.980]   Much, much more than they would have got one nortel.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.740]   Let's point out, though, three times as expensive.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.740]   Yeah, just go ahead.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.740]   I know, and there's a chum change.
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.860]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.260]   Larry Page, you'd find that--
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.420]   It's about the same per patent.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.300]   Somebody did the analysis.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.020]   And if you divide the number of patents,
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.320]   they paid it's almost exactly the same as what they paid for
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:58.820]   nortel.
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.380]   In fact, someone said it was exactly the same,
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:00.980]   which was--
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.100]   I heard it was--
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.740]   I don't know why maybe you put the math in your head, Kevin,
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.940]   but I thought it was more expensive from nortels.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.460]   What was--
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.340]   I don't remember the number though.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.420]   It's not the number.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.860]   It's really--
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:14.140]   Do you have a business in three years or not?
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:14.660]   Yes.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.700]   Is what it really, really is.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.220]   So the truth is, this isn't about making the ultimate Android
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:19.500]   phone.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.140]   This is just about keeping Android free,
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:21.700]   keeping that--
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.580]   No, Gina, you and I are going to believe.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:24.260]   We're going to hope.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.300]   We're going to cross our fingers.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.180]   I believe in fairies.
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:30.020]   It is going to be a better phone.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:30.980]   If it can make--
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:31.180]   Right.
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.580]   --really make better phones, that's good.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.940]   If it can finally get my Android, plus 2.2, that'd be great too.
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.220]   Yeah, maybe at least we'll get a later version
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.180]   of the operating system.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.820]   I like the Android phones a lot.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.780]   They have some room for improvement in the tablet arena.
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.700]   I think they can do better than the Zoom.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.580]   The Zoom.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.820]   I never tried in Atrix, but I mean, at least it
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.500]   seemed like an interesting idea.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.460]   Hey, speaking of patents, I don't know what's going on here.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.260]   But apparently, Jeff Bezos has filed a patent,
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:04.700]   the guy at Amazon, has filed a patent for airbags for phones.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:12.860]   It's an airbag that inflates around you device if you drop it.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.460]   I like it.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:19.500]   That's crazy.
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.060]   Why not?
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.540]   You've got the accelerometer in there.
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.060]   You really wouldn't want this to inflate
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.260]   while you're holding the phone into your ear.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:32.100]   Could be a potential problem, but I think that's a good idea.
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.860]   Upon detecting risk of damage and prior
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:37.140]   to impact with the surface, the damage avoidance system
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.220]   activates a protection system, having one
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.140]   of more protection elements that work in concert
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.900]   to reduce or prevent damage to the portable device
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.260]   upon impact with the surface.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.780]   Airbags.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.980]   They also envision a reorientation element
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.980]   that would turn the device so it hits the ground
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.980]   on the side of the device where the airbag has been deployed.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.220]   It's the cat.
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.220]   Or they could just use that piece so it doesn't land on the screen.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.540]   Yes, just flip it as it goes down.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.820]   Wouldn't that be weird if like a cat?
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.180]   You drop your phone and it goes on the way down.
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.140]   It has on the back.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:09.700]   Like a cat.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.700]   And don't wear a bag.
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.780]   And four little legs come out.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.580]   I think this is the next case in the morning.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.580]   I just waited.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.900]   I can't believe this is not April Fool's.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.020]   I'm just checking, right?
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.540]   This is the strangest.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.940]   It's actually Jeff Bezos and Vice President of Amazon,
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.900]   Gregory M. Hart, who have filed this.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.180]   This is a perfect example of patent.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.180]   The patenting an idea, not an actual process.
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:36.700]   Right.
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.020]   Well, that's the other thing about this software patent stuff.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.300]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.940]   The one that got me this week was
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:46.500]   Apple was filing a patent on printing without printed drivers.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.020]   Right?
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.260]   There was a new store over there, obviously,
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.460]   through the week.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.540]   That should be a commandment of God, not a patent.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.780]   But Google has this thing called Google Cloudprint
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.380]   that they open sourced last year or something
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.300]   that does exactly this.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:00.580]   I mean, if you actually read it through,
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:01.900]   it's pretty much the same thing.
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:02.380]   Right.
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.540]   And I was comparing them.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.220]   It's like, wait a minute, one of these
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.580]   is designed to be obfuscated and not make sense.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.420]   And one of these is code that you run
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.900]   that shows you exactly how to do this.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.420]   Right.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.340]   Why am I allowed to patent the one and not the other?
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.460]   So my take on software patents is OK.
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.820]   You can have software patents, but I better be able to compile
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.020]   what you're issuing.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:19.700]   Oh, I love that.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.340]   You better maintain it for 20 years until it goes free.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.900]   It has to compile and run.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.100]   The point of the patent system was to get people to document
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.020]   their stuff so that other people could build it.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.300]   Well, we have a better mechanism now.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.260]   It's called open source.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:31.460]   Right.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.260]   But OK, if you don't want to go that way,
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.740]   maintain a source code repository,
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.180]   make sure it compiles, and commit
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.500]   to maintaining it for the life of your patent,
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.140]   such that it's usable 20 years afterwards.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:43.900]   Sure.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.140]   If you're going to do that, I'd accept software patents.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.060]   But what they do now instead is have a vague description
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:53.100]   that's designed to be as broad and nebulous as possible
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.060]   and not reducible to a mechanism.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.580]   And there was some case law this week yesterday or today.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.060]   I'm not sure.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.980]   We've asked Denise about it tomorrow.
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:07.220]   But saying that creating a precedent that just because you've
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.820]   turned something from a description into something
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.020]   that runs on a computer doesn't mean it's not nebulous.
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.940]   That was part of it.
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.660]   Does that protection exist for physical patents?
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.540]   Do you have to make it like a wooden working model?
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:18.940]   No.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.780]   You just have to--
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.020]   Historically, you used to.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:27.020]   And that was very much the original intent of it.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.460]   And if you look at the history of patents,
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.740]   that's what it was.
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.340]   And you had to physically bring something
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.260]   to the patent examiner's office.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.500]   And now they don't do that to the same extent.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.260]   But that was certainly the intent of patents.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.100]   There was quite a good article debating history of patents
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:45.380]   this week that said the problem with patents
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.300]   is that we're finding too many stupid ones.
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.660]   And we should be finding sensible ones.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.580]   It's your fault software engineers, which is--
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.300]   Well, no.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.700]   It's a fat part fault of the patent trademark office.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.380]   Is the patent officer accepting that?
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.020]   And the attorneys and owners of the companies,
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.900]   and investors in the companies who push for this.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.820]   Well, as long as the PTO is going to--
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.940]   as long as the PTO accept it, you should file it.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.780]   It would be stupid and imprudent not to file it.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.820]   Especially now when a patent is worth $400 to $500.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:12.980]   Sinkishly.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:13.700]   Wow, that's a bit--
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:14.060]   Well, quite.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.500]   I mean, that's the other thing is that if you work
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.860]   for a high tech company, they'll give you a $1,500 bonus
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.420]   or something for filing a patent.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.660]   And the engineer's now going, wait,
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.180]   they're saving for $400,000 now?
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.380]   Well, what happened there?
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:30.260]   According to Breaking Bad, the guy who invented the synthetic
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:34.020]   diamond only got five bucks.
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.900]   That's enough from General Electric.
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:36.860]   That's another story.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:37.980]   That's what happens when you watch TV.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.860]   You learn things, I think.
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.300]   I have a follow-up story when Obama talks about trying
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.820]   to create jobs through patent reform.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.740]   Is he doing God's work in this?
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.860]   What is his proposal?
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.580]   I don't know.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:56.540]   The Protect IP Act is another one of these annoying,
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.420]   intellectual property, because property's
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.340]   a good thing, time-lores.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.420]   It doesn't actually help any of this.
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.540]   It's the one that lets them shut down websites, right?
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.860]   It's not what we're talking about.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.780]   The Obama speech there was sort of classic,
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.260]   this protects the smaller than this.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.820]   That's just good for jobs.
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:16.580]   It's the opposite of what we see.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.260]   It's actually a crazy bill.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.220]   And I really--
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.940]   There is no making jobs out of thin air.
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:23.420]   No.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:26.100]   I wrote a post a week ago, while we're off.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.180]   It says we're not waiting for a jobless recovery.
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.700]   We have a jobless future.
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.180]   The discussion was incredible on it.
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.980]   And by the way, Hacker News, what's his name?
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:37.980]   The founder of Hacker News.
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.980]   Paul Graham.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.260]   Thank you.
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:40.820]   Paul linked to it on Hacker News.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:41.860]   And boy, is that the best thing to happen?
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.020]   I spent eight hours on my vacation just reading the comments
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:45.940]   and taking notes on them.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.100]   They were brilliant.
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.940]   You're proposing a South by Southwest panel?
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.820]   Oh, please folks, go to South by Southwest.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.860]   Look at my name and say yes to the--
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.500]   can I change the last minute to this talk?
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:55.580]   I think this is great.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.820]   And boy, if you're looking for panelists, I'd love to talk.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:45:59.340]   Oh, great.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.140]   This is fantastic.
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.620]   Yeah, everybody vote for that.
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.580]   You got a link on buzzmachine.com to the--
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.180]   So I didn't mean to--
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.260]   No, this is--
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.140]   I think this is good.
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.500]   Honey, we shrunk the economy.
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.980]   That's what prices me so much is to think
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:12.180]   that we could do one simple thing
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.740]   in the government can make up jobs.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.580]   No, things are changed bigger than that.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.740]   This is much huger than the change.
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:19.620]   Well, that's what Jeremy Rifkin's been saying for three
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.460]   decades.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.220]   Yep.
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:21.780]   Yep.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.140]   And I think he's right.
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.780]   And I don't know what you do to solve it.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:28.140]   But certainly, you don't pass bills like the Protect IP Act.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.740]   That makes me so sad now.
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.420]   The one thing that I feel like people
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.380]   haven't been bringing up in the patent discussion is,
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.940]   have you ever heard of Pierre de Patton?
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:36.940]   No, it's not.
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:37.180]   Pierre--
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.100]   Oh, it's great.
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.980]   And this is what expert labs is actually
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.820]   what the inspiration of expert labs was.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.180]   It's a system that helps employ expert citizens
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.500]   to help the patent office vet applications.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:47.980]   Good idea.
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.900]   So it's basically like crowdsourcing application review
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:51.820]   and vetting.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.460]   And it's been really--
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.460]   it was really successful.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.620]   And it's continuing now.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.980]   And it's something I'd like us to see a lot more.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.700]   Interested parties get to review patent applications
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:06.860]   and provide information on them and help the patent office
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.020]   make good decisions.
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.620]   I think often the case that what really happens
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.620]   is that we sit here as citizens ago,
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.580]   guys darn it dear, government's doing a crappy job
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:17.940]   and they ought to do better.
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:21.860]   And really, the solution is very frequently getting involved
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:22.620]   with this kind of thing.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.220]   The part of the problem with the USPTO
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:26.660]   is that patent examiners do not have to be experts
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.180]   in the field they're examining.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.820]   They don't know prior art.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.140]   They don't know what's going on.
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.220]   But they could be helped.
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.980]   And I've been told by congressional staffers
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.820]   that Congress could do a much better job in writing laws.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:41.820]   If people would step forward and volunteer and help.
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.820]   Well, if someone would actually read them,
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:48.500]   Beth-- I interviewed Beth Novick, who was Obama's head
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:52.420]   of transparency, until she left earlier this year,
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:53.700]   wrote the book "We Can Government"
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:54.380]   and wrote about this.
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.900]   And I interviewed her for public parts.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.900]   And what surprised me most about this, Gina,
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.380]   was that I thought the patent examiners,
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.940]   you know, in the classic view of a government bureaucrat,
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.020]   would resent and hate this.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.020]   And she said, no, they're very low-length.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.340]   Her job takes a long time.
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.940]   They don't know often what they have to do.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.340]   They end up meeting with experts
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.660]   that they need to meet with and hear more
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.060]   and do a better job faster.
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.940]   And what's not to love?
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.860]   Yep.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:19.780]   Yep.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.740]   Yeah, she did an incredible job with Peter Patton.
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.260]   And I'd just like to see--
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:26.580]   I'd like to see here it come up in discussions a little more
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.180]   often as a possible solution.
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:31.380]   Kind of using the internet to employ experts
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.180]   to help these review processes.
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.900]   And Eric Schmidt has said that every government agency
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:36.900]   should be doing this.
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:37.460]   I agree.
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.220]   This is government 2.0.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:39.740]   Yep.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:40.260]   Absolutely.
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.740]   But it starts with us instead of bitching and moaning
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:46.380]   about the government, step forward and do it.
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.500]   The government is of the people.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:54.500]   And so you can't complain about it unless you're participating.
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.780]   I've got this great stuff.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.540]   All right, let's see.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.540]   Cyanogen.
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:01.540]   Oh, I want to hear Gina on this one.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.060]   His name-- his real name is Steven.
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.220]   Was it Conde?
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.740]   Conde, Conde, Conde, yeah.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.180]   I'd love to get him on the show sometimes.
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:09.180]   Deal.
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.420]   He's a quiet guy.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.220]   He doesn't talk much.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.100]   In fact, the story.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.660]   So the story is that he's joined Samsung Mobile.
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:16.540]   But it comes from his Facebook page.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.700]   Well, this is the thing, right?
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.100]   He didn't give an interview or a statement.
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.460]   He just changed his employment status on Facebook.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:25.460]   And I can't find that he's made any kind of comments
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.140]   about this, right?
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.780]   So it's like, is he contracting?
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:28.260]   What?
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.540]   So Steve Conde, Cyanogen, is the--
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.380]   he created the Cyanogen mod, which
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.460]   is one of the most popular Android ROMs.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.420]   And now he's employed by Samsung, apparently.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.740]   He said, according to this article in Engadget,
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.660]   he said that he told his fans that it will be a--
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.260]   no, I'm sorry.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.260]   The Cyanogen mod is not affiliated,
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:51.940]   but he will be working on making Android more awesome.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:52.660]   You're right.
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.460]   He doesn't say whether it's a full time--
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.340]   for some reason I got the sense, maybe I'm wrong,
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.300]   that it was not a full time job.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.780]   Yeah, I mean, we don't know.
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.500]   Because he hasn't really said--
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.060]   but I would love to try to get him on the show sometime.
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:04.620]   So my first--
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:07.420]   I use Sam 7 on my G2X, and I love it.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.420]   I put the nightlies on there now.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:09.940]   Yeah.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.260]   Just because I love the idea that I'm
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.140]   getting an update every day.
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.020]   So finally, you know, you wouldn't--
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.180]   Team Mobile, you wouldn't update me to Gingerbread.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.340]   Well, screw you, I'm going to have the latest every night.
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.140]   Right, and that's Steve.
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:23.460]   I mean, he's been doing some great work.
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:23.820]   That's amazing.
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.980]   He's a huge catch for Samsung, right?
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.580]   But it's one of those things is like, is Samsung
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.380]   going to influence Steve?
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.820]   Is Steve going to influence Samsung?
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:31.340]   It's hard to say.
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.100]   I'm a little concerned about the future of cyanogen mod.
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:35.540]   And also, things get a little weird.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.100]   He was a software engineer anyway.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.660]   But things get weird when your pet weekend project becomes
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.580]   your day job.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:45.540]   Not that they get weird, but sometimes it can get hard.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.260]   You say, well, I want to work on something
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:48.220]   a little different on the weekends.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.380]   I hope that that doesn't happen.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.940]   He said that Samsung is going to stay a side project.
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:54.660]   It's not going to be affiliated with Samsung.
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:57.460]   Let's hope that his influence helps Samsung make
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.260]   a better Android experience.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.540]   He's a pretty strong personality.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.900]   He's a great Android engineer.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.300]   So I think that it will.
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.500]   But I worry for the--
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.340]   But Gene, I'm in devil's mode today.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:12.820]   You often say you want a pure Android experience.
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.020]   And we curse the manufacturers that
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.580]   give us non-standard experiences.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:21.540]   And so now we're-- are we singing the praises of Samsung
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:24.340]   being able to make more non-standard experiences?
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.100]   I think I curse non-standard crappy experiences.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:29.820]   That's my curse, right?
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.460]   Because I think that if a company made a great Android
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:36.460]   skin or interface that improved things about Android,
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:37.100]   Google would--
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:37.980]   That's not the source.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.460]   --would incorporate them into the Android core.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.300]   I know that they would.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.340]   It happened with--
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.300]   It's my better Gmail extension.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.460]   A lot of those features wound up in Gmail Labs.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:47.700]   And they're available to everyone.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.660]   So if people are doing great innovation on top of Android,
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.740]   the good stuff is going to find itself back into the core.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.540]   I want to see that.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.340]   But we really haven't seen too much of that.
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:56.620]   We've seen some pretty skins.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.220]   But we've also seen some crabs.
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.540]   So I think that the stuff that Steve is doing with Sanjan
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.220]   mod is good stuff that people want.
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:05.580]   Users want advanced users, admittedly.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:09.540]   But I'm interested to see him use that knowledge and that
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:11.660]   experience to help out Samsung.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.780]   It's a huge catch for them.
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:13.300]   Good for him.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.740]   Congratulations to him.
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.780]   And I'm excited to see him sort of in the Android--
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.300]   the legitimate Android sphere.
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:19.980]   I don't know.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:20.820]   It'll be interesting to see.
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:22.300]   But let's try to get him on the show.
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:22.860]   I will do that.
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.220]   And I'm sure to have that.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:25.220]   I'm sure to have that.
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.820]   When he was having--
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:27.460]   And we didn't work out.
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.020]   Let's tweet him.
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.060]   Sometimes these guys, if you DM him, it's better.
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.540]   He's wanted to be on the show.
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.180]   There's been some scheduling conflicts.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:34.500]   Yeah.
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.060]   Oh, that's Eileen Rivera, our producer.
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.140]   So maybe we're getting there.
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:37.940]   OK.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:38.860]   Hey, there was good news.
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:39.620]   Then there were bad news.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:40.660]   And there was good news.
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.420]   Google announced that it was going to kill--
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.500]   I was surprised to hear this happen, Venner--
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:48.740]   which is their easy tool for making Android applications.
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.300]   But then the good news was they've actually
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:56.540]   seeded at the Media Lab at MIT the MIT Center for Mobile
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.460]   Learning, dedicated to transforming education
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.900]   and learning through innovation and mobile computing.
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.500]   They gave them the money, and they gave map inventor.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.300]   Got a perfect, huh?
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:04.980]   Yay.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:05.860]   And I love it.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.500]   Hal Abelson is one of the directors of the center.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.620]   He's the guy who did that great MIT class, which
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:14.020]   is still a classic SCIP.
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.580]   You can download it.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:21.300]   Teaching first time computer programmers had to use Lisp.
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:24.060]   And Michael Resnick, a LEGO PAPert Professor
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:24.780]   of Learning Research.
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.740]   I'd love to be just a LEGO PAPert, anything.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:32.700]   And Eric Klopfer, who's a professor of science education.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:33.700]   So they're going to focus--
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.740]   I think this is great, not merely on computer science
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.820]   and electrical engineering, but on education.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:42.500]   And I imagine this will get some great curricula
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:45.140]   on using Appavender, which is funny.
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.740]   Yeah, Appavender is open source,
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:51.100]   but MIT is going to be one of the partners in China.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.460]   So Hal Abelson actually created Appavender
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:56.460]   while he was on leave during a sabbatical at Google.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:57.820]   It makes it a lot of sense.
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.500]   But they already had Scratch, right?
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:05.260]   I think if you've seen Scratch, which was the MIT program
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.500]   for kids talk-it thing.
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.980]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:09.300]   Very similar to Appavender.
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.340]   So if they can actually merge those two, that'll be great.
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.940]   Because Appavender, when I last tried it, was a bit creaky.
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.820]   It was bouncing back and forth between a John Rapper
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:16.460]   and the browser.
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:17.940]   Well, and you have the same problem with Scratch,
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.220]   which is its desktop development.
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.380]   And the future really is mobile development.
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.820]   So if they can bring those two together
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.900]   and make it such that these will generate something
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:29.060]   that's usable as an app or other thing.
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:33.180]   I mean, the ideal for me would be use this as an HTML5
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.900]   authoring tool that would make more sense.
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:40.740]   So Scratch was built that makes it a little job of applets,
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.700]   which is the old embedding app stuff in the Python model.
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.660]   But yeah, no, I'd encourage that it's gone to that center,
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:48.220]   because I think that's a good fit for it.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.420]   You know, I also thought it was interesting,
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:53.180]   is that Joy Ito has accepted--
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.700]   he's going to be director of Media Lab.
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.060]   He is already there, yeah.
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.660]   Which I think is amazing.
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:58.420]   Yeah.
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.780]   Well, the other one is Ethan Zuckerman
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.540]   has taken over a center there, one of the night foundation.
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:04.180]   I went to an event there.
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:06.180]   And I saw the culture change already.
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.300]   God bless the Media Lab.
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:09.980]   But I've worked with them years ago, years, years ago.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.500]   And everything was kind of pridefully useless.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:13.460]   Right.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.020]   Right.
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:18.580]   And they gave some of the old projects they've worked on,
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.220]   and they were good-hearted, but just ridiculous.
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.980]   And then in came--
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.700]   and a lot of religion, a lot of-- well, anything that's
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.740]   a closed network is automatically bad.
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.260]   Twitter is bad because it's closed.
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:30.660]   And Ethan comes in and he says, well,
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:31.860]   people are doing things with Twitter.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:33.340]   That's what the people are.
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.100]   And let's understand it and do stuff with it.
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:39.180]   It was a breath of wonderful fresh Ethan air.
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.500]   So the Dusseldorf Regional Court
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:46.180]   has said that the Galaxy Tab 10.1 can be sold again in Europe.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:51.420]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:53.540]   That's where Apple brought the original complaint
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:54.580]   against Samsung.
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.460]   So the EU has said, well, sell it everywhere,
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:01.900]   but the Germans can't get the Galaxy Tab.
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.340]   Don't know what to say.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.060]   I like that it's making it demand for the thing.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:08.500]   I like my Galaxy Tab, but my 7-inch, but it's not that great.
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.340]   That's true.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:10.820]   A lot of people are saying they hadn't heard of it
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:12.140]   until they heard about this action.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:14.460]   We've heard of it before trying to buy it on the internet.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:17.620]   We've heard it. We can't have it. We must have it.
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:18.140]   Right.
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:21.060]   Well, this-- it seems almost like a, you know,
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:22.660]   a Streisand effect for Apple saying,
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:23.940]   this thing's a copy of the iPad.
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.140]   And they're going, oh, really?
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.500]   Oh, that's true.
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:28.100]   That sounds interesting.
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.900]   And I think I'll take one.
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:32.100]   I like the 10.1.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.940]   I'm a fan of that, that device.
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:34.460]   I do too.
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:35.660]   Actually, I carried it to court.
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:36.460]   Oh, for the connector.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.580]   For my jury duty.
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:40.940]   People thought I had an iPad.
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.780]   A lot of people said, oh, I wish I had an iPad.
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:43.180]   No, it's not an iPad.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.220]   It's different.
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.260]   I live in an iPad tab house.
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.340]   And they're different sizes.
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:49.980]   The cameras at the different place.
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:50.660]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:52.380]   And it's a much better camera.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.780]   Versus landscape.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.460]   There's no hardware button.
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:56.340]   It's different.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.100]   I know it's very similar, but it's different.
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:58.460]   It's different.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:56:59.460]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:04.860]   And it's nicer in some ways as well.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.060]   And it doesn't integrate with the same bits
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:07.740]   the Apple one does.
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:09.020]   It has buses and minuses.
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:10.980]   I have both.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:13.100]   But I find that if I'm reaching one,
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:16.220]   I'll probably reach for the tab first, which is interesting.
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.100]   Steve Gilmore said, oh, if you once
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:19.180]   get the iPad, you won't look back.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.020]   And it's like, oh, well, you know, I've got that too.
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:21.520]   OK.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.220]   Well, you're not looking back, are you?
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:24.720]   True.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:25.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.260]   But anything like that?
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.420]   I'm looking on the floor.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:27.900]   Where's it going?
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.260]   I'm going to do-- we're going to do the first twig
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:32.820]   in weeks without mentioning Google+,
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:35.100]   so I'm just going to skip right over those stories.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.020]   We will, however, mention Glee.
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.220]   OK.
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.180]   Have you gone to see the 3D movie?
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.020]   No, but Cara Swisher said she loves
[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:43.700]   it.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:44.620]   I did.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.180]   I did.
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:45.580]   Opening night.
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:46.140]   Opening night.
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.660]   I got my string backpack.
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.180]   Nice.
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:51.340]   I got my hat the whole thing.
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:53.540]   You guys missed such gleeks.
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:55.660]   It was so charming, Leo, because it really
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:57.940]   was a love song delusory.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:59.220]   It was.
[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:01.020]   So everybody on it, you look at them as well.
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.900]   These are people who are being made fun of elsewhere
[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:03.340]   in the world.
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.260]   And they found their place.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:04.980]   And they're happy.
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.100]   And they're expected.
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:08.220]   And it was really kind of wonderful.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.340]   I hate the 3D part.
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:10.340]   That was driving me nutty.
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:11.100]   I don't go to 3D.
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.820]   It was good to see what it's doing.
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:13.500]   Needless.
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.180]   They're singing.
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:15.620]   What are they going to do like this?
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:16.060]   What am I doing?
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:16.260]   What?
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:20.900]   It's my wife had on like a wig sunglasses and a mustache.
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:22.140]   She didn't want to be recognized.
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:23.060]   I was like this.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.580]   That's so funny.
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:26.700]   That's so funny.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:27.940]   So where is it?
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:31.020]   In your house, then this is the equivalent of the chick flick.
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:31.460]   Basically.
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:33.860]   Yes, exactly.
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.660]   You know, for years, I've been saying
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.100]   that this meant Lapordian.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:41.500]   So I'm just glad to welcome the gleeks into the--
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.860]   I just wanted to get that in there.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.220]   We haven't done Chipotle jokes.
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:45.100]   We haven't done Google Plus.
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.420]   No, no, no.
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.060]   It got in glee.
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:48.780]   Thank you, Jeff.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.500]   Opening night, it was very exciting.
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.780]   So I'm glad to hear that you saw it.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.420]   You did your homework for the show.
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:56.700]   Well, and they're good news that Google is now offering $20,000
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.660]   scholarships to aspiring tech journalists.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.220]   Do you like this idea?
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:02.180]   I love this idea.
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.020]   And I want to get that money for my students.
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.740]   Yeah, I think it's a fantastic thing.
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.700]   Six graduate or undergraduate students
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:10.260]   will each get $20,000 toward a degree in any field that
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:13.740]   combines journalism, new media, and computer science.
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:14.500]   It's about time.
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:22.220]   We need smarter press, smarter judiciary, smarter Congress.
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.740]   Anything that brings computer science education
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.580]   into those fields is a good thing, I think.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.020]   Is this about Google trying to make
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.100]   nice with the news and corporations or--
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:31.540]   Yeah, somewhat.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:32.540]   Somewhat.
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.180]   I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt here.
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:35.180]   I think they're right.
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:39.500]   I think an informed technology press is good for everybody.
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.900]   And enough ignorance, enough stupidity.
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.860]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.940]   Certainly, it's something I can get behind.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:47.340]   Ignorance and stupidity.
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.900]   So let's see.
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:53.060]   I think we're going to take a break and come back
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:56.140]   with your tip, Gina.
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:57.060]   Jeff's number of the week.
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.500]   Am I tool of the week in just a second before we do that?
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.580]   I just want to remind everybody.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.300]   I don't even have to take any time to do this.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:02.940]   Get Netflix.
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.500]   If you don't have Netflix, get Netflix.
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.940]   Go to Netflix.com/twit.
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:09.500]   If you already have Netflix, tell a friend.
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.620]   Tell a family member, $7.99 a month for unlimited streaming,
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:17.380]   including "Glee," "Mad Men," "Movies."
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.940]   Just as the best.
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:23.220]   I live on Netflix streaming to the constant despair
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.340]   and dismay of Comcast.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:27.020]   Another good reason to do it.
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:30.300]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.260]   We thank you for your support.
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.460]   And now--
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.020]   Whoa!
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.020]   Nice.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.580]   I had to throw it in there.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.540]   I love the Trycast.
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.620]   We're having so much fun with the 8,500 extreme.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.260]   A tip of the hat to the new tech for that.
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.940]   Before we get to that, we have one second.
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.780]   The Netflix runs on the Chromebook now this week.
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.860]   That was something that was new this week.
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:51.660]   They have a kid tab on the Netflix.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:52.660]   Is that what you're talking about?
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:54.100]   You know, it runs on the Chromebook.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.620]   Oh, it runs on Chromebook?
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.380]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.900]   How does it do that?
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.420]   Through software, through the power of--
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.460]   But I thought it was a silver-like client.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:03.340]   So they must be using--
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.540]   What is an network support?
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.940]   Does it support Flash or WebM?
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.980]   I think it's using WebM.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.740]   I'm actually-- you can't put it to bits as easily.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.020]   So I don't know.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.580]   But Netflix isn't exclusively silver-like.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.820]   They run on whatever's available.
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:18.540]   But the challenge is getting agreement
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.780]   from the lawyers that the DRM is suitable.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.100]   So she's why they didn't run on some Android tablets.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:23.780]   But they've actually--
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.260]   And why they don't run on Chrome and Linux.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:27.260]   By the way.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.460]   Well, they do run Chrome and Linux stuff.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.580]   This is Chrome and Linux, but--
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:32.980]   No, but not just kind of generic Chrome and Linux.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.300]   You don't have to have a netbook.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:35.260]   Oh, Chromium.
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.620]   The Chromium on the--
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:37.980]   Gotcha.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.460]   Yes, the DRM got worked out.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:40.700]   Obviously, they figured out--
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.420]   Obviously, it's something they figured out there.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:44.460]   Yep.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:47.060]   So Gene, did you guys-- I can't get my timing straight here.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.420]   Did the whole discussion of shutting down social networks
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:53.060]   out of the UK riots and all that happened on last week's show?
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:53.500]   I don't know.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.460]   You did discuss that a bit.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:54.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.700]   I was presuming that it had.
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:57.700]   Yeah.
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.020]   Yeah, because it's--
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.940]   I mean, a great story, a fascinating story.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.380]   But--
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.980]   Well, the news story since then, I think,
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.980]   is that the pair who got four years
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:09.500]   for trying to incite riots, which didn't happen on Facebook
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.420]   and others got arrested for suggesting
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.260]   water gun fights on Facebook.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:14.180]   Oh, please.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.140]   It's gotten to be absurd.
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:15.900]   Oh, please.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.100]   Four years in jail.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:21.060]   Wow.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.340]   Because they created a Facebook group called--
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.060]   Saying Smash Down in Norwich Town.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:30.900]   He said, meet up behind the McDonald's for a Luton.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:34.540]   He was the only one who showed up.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.540]   So it didn't really work that well.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:37.060]   Four years.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.540]   I said they shut his page down.
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.780]   Four years.
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:44.420]   And then this other guy set up a page called The Warrington
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:44.940]   Riots.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.180]   He took it down a few hours later.
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.860]   His lawyer said he was drunk when he posted it.
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:53.940]   And he took it down as soon as he sobered up.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.980]   Boy, this is the Salem witch trials.
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.700]   And the Bart stuff is just--
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.220]   The Bart thing is amazing.
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:01.580]   The good news--
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.460]   We should just mention we talked about it on a twip.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:06.980]   But this was because Bart was worried about protests
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:11.140]   about a shooting that occurred on Bart some years ago.
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.420]   The Bart police unilaterally decided
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.820]   to shut down cell phone access.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.420]   And some Bart is the light rail system in the San Francisco Bay
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:18.740]   area.
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.740]   The unilaterally shut down cell phone access
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:24.140]   in some of the Bart stations.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.380]   The good news is the FCC is now investigating
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.780]   because it's a violation of the 1934 Communications
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.340]   Act to shut down phone service.
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.220]   You can't do that.
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.260]   Well, that was one of the--
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:35.420]   Around the UK was that they were saying--
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:36.740]   They were shut down blackberry--
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.500]   Blackberry messenger or Twitter or whatever.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.340]   And Facebook joined during riots.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.260]   And the tag--
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.700]   Inherent stupidity.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.380]   Really, if you want to prosecute for conspiracy,
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.700]   this is a good way to get evidence.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.860]   If you shut it down, you won't get it.
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:49.660]   There you go.
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.460]   How are we going to know?
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.380]   Hosni Mubarak learned that lesson.
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:54.500]   So thank you for that.
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.700]   I just wanted to get that off my hand.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:56.940]   The Twitter hashtag for the Bart.
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:00.860]   Shut down was moo Bartek.
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:05.780]   All right, now Gina's tip of the week.
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.900]   So Google Labs has been shut down.
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.380]   But that doesn't mean--
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.020]   I know.
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:10.540]   I know.
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.100]   But it doesn't mean the individual products,
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.460]   lab sections, aren't shut down.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:16.980]   Like Gmail has labs and Google Calendar has labs.
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.660]   Google Maps for Android also has labs.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:24.140]   And in the latest Google Maps application update on Android,
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.540]   there's a new labs feature.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:28.780]   So if you're in Google Maps on your Android phone,
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.380]   you go to menu, go to More, and there's a Labs item.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:34.780]   And there's a few different cool little features you can enable.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.980]   You can pre-cache maps.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:37.980]   You know you're going to be not going to have a signal.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.420]   You can measure--
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:43.460]   you can increase the size of the text.
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.700]   You can measure units, like distance between units.
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.860]   But there's a new labs feature called Bubble Buttons,
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:51.180]   which just makes the buttons that show up when you search
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.900]   for a place on maps like really big.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.140]   There's a great big navigation button and a great big--
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:56.660]   I like it.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:57.260]   --call a button that shows--
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.580]   It fills the screen.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.420]   It fills the screen.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:01.260]   And it shows whether or not the business is open.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.900]   So if you're in the car and you go into a place,
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.180]   you can hit a button real quick.
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.460]   It's just a minor little tweak.
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:08.060]   But it's useful if you-- I use maps a lot.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.940]   I basically use my Android phone for email and maps.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:14.100]   So if you haven't checked out labs and Google Maps on Android,
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:14.540]   check it out.
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:15.380]   It's in the menu.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:16.620]   But make sure you get your update first,
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.540]   because this bubble button, this feature,
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.460]   just came down the latest update.
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.220]   I like big bubble buttons.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:23.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.940]   I love big buttons.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:26.820]   And I cannot lie.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.020]   I cannot lie.
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.940]   Those other brothers can't deny.
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.580]   Can't deny.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.300]   When a map comes up with a great big--
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:33.740]   Never mind.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:34.740]   Button?
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:35.500]   Button?
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.300]   You just got to--
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.300]   I got sprung.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.300]   Oh, god.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.300]   Sir Mixalot.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.700]   Sir Mapsalot.
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:44.500]   Sir Mapsalot.
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.140]   Sir Mapsalot.
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:48.180]   I think we've got a parody video here.
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.380]   It looks like a little.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:50.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.780]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:54.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:57.580]   Jeff Jarvis, your numero of the week.
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.300]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:00.740]   Six.
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.300]   As in degrees of separation, Cam Marlow,
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:06.260]   who is now data chief at Facebook, formerly Yahoo,
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:09.700]   has put the two worlds together to create small world
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:15.500]   at sandbox.yahoo.com to actually bring research data that
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.620]   will end up in a peer review journal kind of article
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:21.500]   about trying to test six degrees of separation.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:22.000]   Really?
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:22.580]   You go on--
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.780]   I thought that was just accepted.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:27.540]   Well, now that may be shorter, maybe less.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.340]   So you go on to that site against small world
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:34.940]   at sandbox.yahoo.com, and you put in the name of someone else
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:38.060]   and see what the system can do to route you.
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:38.980]   Oh, so I want to--
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:40.020]   This sounds like fun, wait a minute.
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:40.580]   I'm going to agree.
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.420]   I thought you were going to go to--
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.940]   Yeah, this sounds like fun.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.900]   And then I have to-- oh, I have to say Facebook.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.660]   Because I guess that's how they're doing it, huh?
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:48.540]   Using Facebook.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:52.020]   OK, so I'm allow the Yahoo's small world experiment.
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.980]   My objective-- get a message to this person
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:58.060]   in as few steps as possible.
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.620]   Does it count if I use Twit?
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:06.380]   Eden, Elon-- it lives in Jerusalem.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.300]   So you can select--
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:09.020]   It's Jeff Paulver.
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.500]   Jeff Paulver is probably a good choice.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.460]   All right, I think Paulver's on my Facebook friends.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.980]   Let's continue the chain.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:15.060]   Select who's the closest.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:15.860]   Let's see if I have Jeff.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.140]   We're no Steve Arte, either one.
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:18.340]   You're Steve Arte, definitely.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:21.340]   Yeah, well, I don't know if I have Yossi in my Facebook,
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:22.300]   but I bet you I have Jeff.
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:23.060]   Let's see.
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:23.380]   What?
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.100]   Jeff.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:24.860]   You'd think.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:25.500]   So this is cool.
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.100]   So you get to pick one and only one person
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:30.340]   from your Facebook friends.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.860]   There's Jeff Jarvis, Jeff McPherson.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.300]   Well, that's how the experiment works.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.860]   I mean, the original small world experiment was,
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.300]   you're supposed to pick the person
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.900]   and send it to you that should get it closer.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:39.100]   Right.
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.060]   And we'll see how far it gets.
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.100]   Unfortunately, Jeff Paulver is not.
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:46.540]   Duncan Watts, who's a Yahoo researcher,
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:50.500]   re-readed the experiment through email a few years back.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.220]   And the original experiment was they
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:55.180]   had a small group of people, somewhere in Omaha,
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:56.500]   and somewhere in Boston.
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.100]   They were trying to get hold of a lawyer in Boston.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.540]   And they were told, Mel, this to the person who you think
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.820]   can get it closest and get them to pass it on.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.260]   And most of them didn't get through,
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:08.780]   but the ones that did get through the median number of links
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:09.380]   were six.
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:10.580]   So that's where that number comes from.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.100]   That was the original millgram experiment
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.780]   way back in the '50s or '60s.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.020]   So the question would be--
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.220]   And then talk about what's--
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:21.660]   Could you social media shorten that chain then?
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:22.300]   Right.
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.060]   Are we in a more connected world now, which
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.100]   would one, one, one, to hope and assume,
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:32.260]   where you can make this with fewer hops, as we would say today?
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:32.540]   All right.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.420]   So I am going to--
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:36.860]   now I have to choose-- what is all of this stuff?
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:38.420]   I guess this is just additional material
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:43.500]   to help them with their research, right?
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.420]   They want to know my occupation.
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:49.740]   I never-- they never have punted in here.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:52.820]   So I guess I'll just choose media.
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:55.540]   I'm a media thing.
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:56.820]   Writer/editor, probably.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:57.180]   All right.
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.060]   So let's see.
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:58.500]   So I put--
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.460]   Renee Blodger, that's a good choice.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:02.500]   Yeah, Renee has led tours of Israel.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.020]   Go.
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:03.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.180]   I mean, that's the closest I could come.
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.860]   And then I say, how do I know her work?
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:11.300]   She's a publicist, I've known her for, I think, 10 years.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.420]   She does the gig tours.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:12.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.860]   And she did a gig tour to Israel, a couple of gig tours
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:15.380]   to Israel.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.660]   So I suspect-- in fact, invited me on one.
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:22.980]   I turn it down because I consider it not editorially.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:26.820]   I regard her as a business or professional acquaintance,
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:29.500]   relationship three.
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.220]   Where are they-- yeah, I don't know.
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.460]   OK, so there's a lot of stuff.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.180]   OK.
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:35.660]   Boy, invite the friend to join the chain.
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:36.300]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.180]   Renee's probably already.
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:37.700]   Oh, boy.
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:39.020]   Cheese Louise.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.700]   Join-- let's see.
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:42.300]   Cool.
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:44.180]   Now it's going to look like some game.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.020]   I think this is more than a game.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:47.580]   Yeah, no, it's research.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.700]   It's science.
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:50.340]   OK, good.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:51.380]   Now we'll see.
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.620]   Now, will I get information back?
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:54.100]   I don't know.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:55.860]   I'm going to become a target.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.300]   You can become a target.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:58.420]   Oh, that's cheating.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:59.260]   That's wonderful.
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:00.740]   You'll single-handedly bring down the--
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:06.180]   I am separated by a zero degrees of separation from everybody.
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.940]   I'm just going to leave what's in there from Facebook,
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.020]   not at any additional features.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:10.540]   And we'll see.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.060]   OK.
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.220]   I just all around thanks to the power of Leo.
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.620]   Let's see what happens.
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:18.020]   I'm going to show you my pick of the week, which kind of--
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.460]   I just was inspired to talk about it because of the cyanogen
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:21.820]   story.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.060]   And I mentioned that I do--
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:28.780]   Let's open the curtain on my pick of the week.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:31.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.580]   Hey, we all want our own transition.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.100]   Starting to feel like--
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:36.620]   I don't think that.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:37.620]   --want mine now.
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.740]   And if you're like home improvement or something,
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:45.860]   this is the easiest way to modify your phone.
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.100]   It's on the Android market.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.300]   It's completely legal.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.420]   You do have to root your phone first.
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.100]   And for that, you merely Google root
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.100]   and the brand of Android phone that you have.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.060]   You should easily find a one-click rooting solution.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.780]   But once you've rooted it, this is the way
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.940]   to make it possible to save your current state,
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:07.340]   to restore it, to add other ROMs.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:07.940]   It's free.
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:10.260]   It's called ROM Manager from ClockworkMod.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.700]   And I'm sure you must use ClockworkMod, Gina,
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.860]   when you do your modification of your phone.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:18.140]   It's really a very-- it's a great recovery tool.
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:22.860]   And they also have a premium version for $6,
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.860]   which I recommend buying, because that gives you access
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.620]   to the cyanogen nightlies.
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:29.700]   And what's great is, because I've got a ROM manager running
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:34.020]   on my G2X, it notifies me when there's a new ROM automatically.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.660]   So almost every morning I wake up and I say,
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.980]   ooh, I can screw up my phone this morning.
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.380]   So far, those nightlies are quick.
[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:46.500]   And I haven't had a problem with them at all.
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.500]   Wow!
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.140]   Wow.
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:49.940]   So that's--
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:50.420]   Buying it up to--
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.540]   That's just a tool as well.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.100]   That's buying it up to the screen.
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:56.500]   Would you like Kevin Marks to make a tip, a suggestion?
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:57.740]   I had something to this--
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.740]   That's just a tool.
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:03.340]   So there's an Android app called Nano Twitter,
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:04.500]   which I've always been a fan of.
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:07.900]   Basically, what it does is it takes Twitter messages
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.620]   and turns them straight into Android notifications.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:13.740]   And you can put through app replies, direct messages.
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.700]   And you can put a list of names in it,
[01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:18.340]   and it'll check your feed of those and pass them through.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:22.220]   And I've always liked this thing, but it broke when
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:25.340]   Twitter updated their stuff.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.500]   And I was annoyed by this.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.380]   But then I realized last week this thing's open source.
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:31.260]   So I went and found downloaded the source and patched it
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.820]   and sent the patch to the original guy.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:34.340]   Nice.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:35.380]   It works again.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:37.180]   I love open source.
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.180]   I love Kevin Marks.
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:39.620]   Kevin, you want to work on my app?
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.380]   That's awesome.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.380]   That's a couple bugs you'd work on.
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.380]   That's awesome.
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:43.780]   I thought I'd fix it, actually.
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:44.780]   I'll hang with you when I do.
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:45.780]   But then that was the--
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:48.060]   You know, I just find this--
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:48.860]   I just find this--
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:49.260]   I just find this--
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:50.580]   But I fixed it for them.
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:51.580]   I fixed it.
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.780]   But now, what is this?
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:53.340]   Do this different?
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.700]   Because like the-- there's two standard Twitter
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.300]   client you can say in notifications,
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.500]   saying, notify me when there's a DM.
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.060]   And it'll show up in notifications.
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:12:59.580]   This is different.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:00.740]   If it gives you annoying notifications,
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:01.740]   it gives you like--
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:03.460]   you know, it's like there's Google+ ones
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.220]   that are like somebody commented on something
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:06.260]   that you don't know about.
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.900]   Whereas this one, it just translates the tweet
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.460]   directly into a notification so you can see
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.700]   who it's from and what the whole tweet is.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.740]   And obviously, you wouldn't want every tweet you can read
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.620]   coming through that way unless you go to Spotify.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:17.060]   Do it with DMs, probably.
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.660]   But for DMs, it works for ads.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.620]   And you can say, oh, I want to hear everything Leo says.
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:23.940]   And I put Leo at the portal and they show you all the Leo ones.
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.660]   And it's very simple.
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.500]   It doesn't draw much battery if you don't set it to poll too
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.460]   often.
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:32.460]   I just find it a really useful way to work with Android.
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.820]   The other thing is when you select them,
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:37.500]   because of Android has intents,
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.460]   you can choose which Twitter client to view them in.
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.180]   And remember the preference, and it'll go there.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:42.620]   Love that.
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:43.620]   Love that.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.460]   By default, it routes you back to the Twitter web,
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.940]   but you can route it to the Twitter client or Cismic
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.060]   or whatever Android Twitter really like.
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:50.700]   Love that.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.980]   And this is the other part I love about Android.
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:56.180]   Market.android.com, you press the Install button,
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:59.140]   you tell it which phone you wanted to install it on.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:00.460]   I have to sign in my Google account.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:02.020]   For some reason-- oh, does this do this to you?
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.100]   It always makes me sign in my Google account each time.
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:04.600]   Yes.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.940]   It's a security account.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.420]   That's a little annoying.
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:10.020]   You don't want to leave yourself logged in and have people
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.380]   randomly write and store things to your phone.
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:14.140]   I guess that makes sense.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:17.740]   It's bad enough leaving you to self-logging the phone.
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:19.620]   So there, and now I'm going to send this to my phone.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.660]   And when I go get my phone, it will have installed
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:22.460]   Nano Twitter.
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.980]   And that's nice.
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:29.340]   That's why we like Android best.
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:30.620]   Hey, thank you so much for being here.
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.220]   Kevin Marks is at salesforce.com,
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:35.300]   but is the greatest dude commentator on all things

[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.940]   because I'd love to hear the Kevin Marks story.
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:41.340]   Can I do one more little plug?
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.300]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:45.780]   On Tamil Vision tomorrow night, Tamilvision.tv,
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:50.380]   we've got Paul Adams, who's the original originator
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:53.900]   of the Google circles idea, who's now working at Facebook,
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:57.620]   coming on to talk to us about social experience design
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.340]   and things.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:59.540]   That would be great.
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:02.220]   If you're missing the lack of Google+ in this show,
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.740]   come on us to us tomorrow night.
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:06.220]   We left it out so you could have it, Kevin Marks.
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:10.140]   Tamilvision.tv tomorrow night at 6 p.m.
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.380]   Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:15.420]   With Deb, of course, and Heather, and Kevin,
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.780]   and a great show which you must listen to.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:22.820]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York.
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.780]   He's also online at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:27.260]   And is a great guy at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter,
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:30.260]   plus Jeff Jarvis on the Google.
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:33.380]   But by the way, @worksonthegoogleplus, which is kind of cool.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.580]   Yes, which I like to hear.
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:37.420]   You just say @, and that could be either one.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.980]   And it's great to see you again, Jeff.
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:41.980]   I'm glad to have you back, and I'm glad to be back.
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:43.220]   We are so happy to have you back.
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:44.900]   Yay, I love this show.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:48.780]   And of course, Gina Trapani, who is at smarterware.org
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.740]   and contributor to many great sites and always fun,
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.780]   plus Gina Trapani or @Genitrapani.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.820]   Yes, plus or @, great to be here.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:57.820]   And I hope that I'm going to plug it.
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:58.980]   Oh, thank you.
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:01.420]   And I'm going to plug Jeff's public parts video,
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.180]   which is super cool.
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:02.860]   Everyone try it out.
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:03.380]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:04.380]   I didn't hear about that.
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:04.380]   What's that?
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:05.580]   There's a trailer for the book, right?
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:08.380]   Right, Jeff?
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:08.820]   He's gone.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:09.340]   Yep.
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:09.820]   Oh.
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.220]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:13.060]   Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.060]   Why don't we end the show with Jeff Jarvis explaining
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.820]   public parts, and we'll see you all next time
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:22.380]   on This Week in Google.
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:25.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:29.340]   This is embarrassing.
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.340]   No.
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:34.780]   We're entering a magnificent age of sharing and publicness.
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:37.300]   600 million of us have joined Facebook.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:40.260]   We've shared stuff a billion times a day.
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:42.860]   Each of us now has our own Gutenberg press.
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:45.660]   It enables us to speak to anyone in the world.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:49.300]   So this is a time of great opportunity for transparency.
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:52.460]   But at the same time, there are many fears about privacy.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.580]   They'll mind you, privacy is important.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:56.060]   It needs to be protected.
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:57.940]   I've found in my research for public parts
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:02.380]   that fears about privacy often come with new technologies.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.300]   When Gutenberg invented the press,
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:06.420]   authors were scared of putting their thoughts down
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:09.140]   on paper permanently spread widely under their name.
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:11.300]   And now the internet, perhaps the greatest technology
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:14.940]   we've ever had, is causing lots of fears about privacy.
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:17.020]   We have these magnificent new tools
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:18.940]   that enable us to do so much.
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:21.100]   If all we do is pay attention to privacy,
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:25.940]   we may lose the opportunities and the benefits of publicness.
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.180]   Now this works on a--
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.020]   You can editing.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.780]   --scale of society, but it won't be worth it for--
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:30.660]   It's only two minutes.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:31.260]   Come on.
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:32.620]   I've been very public about my public--
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:33.460]   So impatient.
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:35.820]   We can't get much more public than that.
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:37.700]   You wonder, why the hell would I do that?
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.660]   Because I got great benefit back.
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.420]   I've had friends who had this operation,
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.180]   and I didn't have any way to know that,
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.860]   except that I told the world about it.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.380]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:47.980]   Friends of mine have gone and gotten their pro states checked
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:49.460]   because of what I went through.
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:50.460]   And it's fun.
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:53.540]   That means that there's a bit that's sure you can't keep in mind
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.540]   that sometimes when you hold something back,
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.860]   you have to ask yourself, would that be selfish?
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:01.940]   Being public enables you to build relationships.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.940]   You can stay in your home all day long,
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.820]   but then you don't know what relationships you didn't build.
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.780]   If you're a company, you can operate
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:10.460]   with your customers and your suppliers
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:11.740]   in all kinds of new ways.
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.460]   If your government, you bloody well
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:15.580]   should be out having new kinds of relationships
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:16.260]   with the public.
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.900]   Publicness is also about organizing.
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.340]   We can organize movements.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.980]   We can organize clubs.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.380]   We can organize all kinds of things.
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:24.700]   All these things become possible
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.620]   because we open up to the world
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:28.780]   and have the faith to do so.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.740]   So I think this is the beginning of an age
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.380]   of sharing and publicness.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:35.380]   Love it.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:36.900]   Take that one.

[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.940]   Kevin, we're talking right now with Salesforce
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:51.660]   about being part of the Dreamforce conference.
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.980]   They want me to do a social media panel.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:55.780]   Oh, perfect.
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:58.060]   So I hope maybe I can get all three of you to be on that.
[01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:58.820]   That'd be kind of fun.
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:18:59.620]   That'd be great.
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:01.260]   I've gone to Salesforce events
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:04.580]   and they bring in smart people and they're good events.
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:06.100]   Yeah, it'd be a lot of fun.
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:09.580]   Well, Dreamforce is August 31st in San Francisco.
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.700]   And I think you can still get tickets.
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:12.420]   Is it that soon?
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:13.420]   Wow.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:15.460]   Have we made the arrangements yet?
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.860]   I thought it was September that we were talking about.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:19.540]   It's the end of all the spin of September.
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:20.060]   OK.

[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:21.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:22.580]   It would be September 1st would be the day of the panel,
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:22.940]   actually.
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.660]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:25.140]   Great.
