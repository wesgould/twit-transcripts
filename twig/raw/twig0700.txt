[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   It's time for tweet this week in Google Stacey's here Jeff's here and here
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.580]   We're gonna start the show by talking to a Google employee who was just laid off and kind of a
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.980]   Unpleasant manner. What's it like to get laid off? What are his plans for the future?
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.720]   And why does he think these cuts are happening?
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.220]   I wanted to get a personal look at all these layoffs and so many people as many as 200,000 people have been laid off in tech this month
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.400]   We'll also take a look at a very big lawsuit against Google from the Department of Justice
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.160]   This one might have some merit and of course section 230 under attack
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.520]   I think I've changed my tune on this. It's all coming up next on twig

[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.920]   Hello, sir
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.920]   You brought a friend
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.480]   Yeah, I brought a friend, but I don't know if it's in the best of news the best of times
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.560]   So we talked sort of feel bad
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.300]   Well, no actually I'm really glad because we talk a lot of we've been talking for the last couple of weeks about
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.940]   big layoffs in tech, you know 12,000 people at Google 11,000 at Microsoft Facebook, right?
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.960]   But there's no face to it and I always try to say you know
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.840]   I lay offs always terrible and then we always talk about why and the companies and so forth
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.720]   Let's bring a face to it one of the things I noted
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.440]   I've been noticing over the last couple of weeks on Twitter is as Google lays off
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.280]   people I've seen farewells on Twitter and
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:40.000]   I've asked it on from Google engineers many of whom have been there for years and this kind of it's not a
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:55.440]   No, I'm so sorry I had cough drops and I just had to I was putting away. I'm so sorry
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.520]   The movie theater who takes 10 minutes to open the package are you that first cow?
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.360]   Would you know I was I was like I need to put the cough drops away so I can do my job
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.560]   But I'm also like the cough drops make me feel better. You like a junior man. They're curiously refreshing
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.320]   Just don't just don't drop it into the open corpse of Richard. Hey, okay
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.600]   I'm sorry Richard. Hey is here. He is the face of all of those layoffs Google cutting
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   thousand jobs and
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.360]   I first of all, I don't want to say condolences, but I'm sorry that happened. How long were you at Google Richard?
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:47.500]   Well, I was at Google from July of 2007 to Friday. Well, and technically we're still employed until March 31st
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.240]   You know you learned this in a very
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.960]   unpleasant way
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.200]   Yeah, they they did send a you know a company script
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.800]   You know form letter type of you try to log in and it redirects you to I'm sorry to inform you that boom your dog died
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.720]   But yeah, so that was but actually I heard about it before that email
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.060]   I saw because one of the software developers in Belgium
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.680]   Sent me a message on LinkedIn and said that he saw that I was impacted and was I okay?
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.680]   And I didn't even know there was a layoff yet. Oh
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.720]   Well, but see right here from a friend
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.960]   Okay, then then the script that you get and I later asked him how did he even know?
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.040]   That I was impacted and he said they had created a group
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.840]   Inside of Google of all the people that were impacted and he was just looking throughout usernames and he saw
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.120]   So that's how you knew so there was a spreadsheet somewhere or something
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.560]   So I guess throughout the course of the day
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.040]   They actually blocked access because they didn't want people doing that
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.320]   But he got it. He got it before they watched it time zone Richard
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.920]   I had a breakfast with a friend at Google's by happen since yesterday and
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.760]   He said that his boss has hundreds of employees and didn't know that it was my box. I
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.680]   That it was done your boss. Yeah, it was it was yeah, my boss
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.480]   I mean I called and I said did you and I just had a meeting with him on Tuesday?
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.080]   I mean, you know and there was no
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.360]   Inquing anything like this on the horizon, right? So it was the decision was made on a whole nother level
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.740]   Than us, right? So layoffs are always unpleasant Google like a lot of tech companies had done a lot of hiring
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.280]   during the pandemic and in my mind I
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.080]   thought a lot of this was just kind of
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.640]   retrenching after
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.420]   excessive hiring in Wall Street Journal said something that Google had increased its
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:46.940]   Headcount by like 47 percent. I mean, so I was very surprised to see how many senior people were let go as well
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.900]   What were you working on Richard before before the end?
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.600]   So like most recently I was working on some internet
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.260]   edge operation
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:05.840]   troubleshooting for cloud customers, but probably more interestingly right before that I was working for about 18 months on
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.400]   scaling and deploying
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.720]   The back end infrastructure for Starlink a space X Starlink the space internet thing. Oh cool
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.400]   Right now they've actually figured out how to do what we were doing for them without us
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.520]   So they moved off of Google's back end, but but but that was pretty cool to work on that, right?
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.920]   nice, so
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.400]   For fiscal year, this is from the Wall Street Journal ending in September 2019
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.840]   I'm sorry beginning September 2019 to September 2022 that one year period
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.320]   Amazon doubled employee account. This is because of pandemic. I think Microsoft went up 53 percent
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.700]   Alphabet up went 57 percent. That's a huge growth met a
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.360]   94 percent
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.040]   So and my initial reaction as I said to this was well
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.960]   Yeah, the pandemic's over and there was a big boom and now there's some retrenching
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.160]   Did they explain to you why you were cut as opposed to somebody would have been hired in the last year?
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.820]   So that I was that is very
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.480]   unclear. I don't know what rubric they use to
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:19.680]   Cururistic to determine who it was and and I got to admit I had seen the same news that everyone else had been seeing about
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:26.640]   Amazon laying off people and Microsoft laying off people and and all these articles saying oh well Google is you know
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.200]   People are worried about layoffs at Google
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.880]   But I I wasn't worried about it, but apparently I should have been
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:41.240]   Well, they'd go to your boss and do some stack ranking or something as brutal as that sounds and say well
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.760]   Who can you lose but your boss didn't even know about this?
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.840]   Right doesn't Google do a lot not via algorithm, but I imagine and then
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.840]   My hunch is they tend to get rid of people who
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.180]   Not are replicable. I'm not trying to say that you are
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:05.120]   Replicable but who have who have roles that are replicated across the company and then the written
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.680]   Yeah, and you might just be the more senior and paid the most whereas someone
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.280]   Does come I mean
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.000]   the longer you've been in a job unless you're like in charge of things
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.440]   You're at a risk because you're expensive
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.840]   Right, and they probably can find someone else that does what I do for less money, right?
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.400]   I know that happened to me is the stuff you were working on
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.480]   deprecated maybe that
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.800]   Had something to do with it too
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.960]   I mean, maybe they didn't want to pursue that line and I know at Microsoft all the HoloLens people are gone and the
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.720]   Reality people are gone
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.560]   Yeah, no, I you know I by the beginning of my career
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:51.360]   I worked on like building and deploying and developing all of the data center switching equipment that's in every data center in the world
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.200]   So I worked on that for about eight years and so
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.960]   But then I left that team so lately when I did go to the Starlink thing
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:09.440]   That was more operations and not as much engineering and then it's it's possible that you know that I had even been looking around for other
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.720]   Opportunities to go back into engineering
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.520]   So it's possible. I just wasn't a good fit for that
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.960]   And that they just something in that made them decide well
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.520]   We can do the ops stuff with you know other people and not we don't need him
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.400]   I don't know how hard was it to switch roles like that in Google?
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.080]   I was it about I switched out different roles about six times
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.720]   So I mean I worked on the platforms team for about eight years
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.920]   but then I decided I wanted to live in Texas because
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:45.040]   My wife she said my friends are in Texas my mom's in Texas. My sisters are in Texas and we're going to Texas
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.440]   Well because I was in Texas when I was recruited in 2007 and they forced me to go to California
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.480]   So then you know I and so I did switch to Google fiber for a couple years
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.160]   Because they said hey do you want to live with your kids, which is a strong pitch
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.480]   Because that's when I met you is when you're with fiber
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.200]   Right, I was with fiber at that time and then and then I went and
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:15.920]   Once I decided to go and work in a team that was doing private LTE stuff and deployment of sensors to detect aircraft carriers
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.720]   On the east of the west coast. So that was so that's a pretty fun thing
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.680]   You're in Mountain View and a promo committee deciding who lives and who dies and you run into one of your old buddies
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.320]   And he's like hey
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.000]   You want to help me detect aircraft carriers and I'm like well can I live in Austin?
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   They're like I don't care where you live and then it's click click click and you're on that team
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.360]   So it's not that hard to switch teams and that's one of the other reasons why I had no real
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.200]   Concern that this sort of because they've never done anything like this
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.280]   It's the largest layoff in Google history
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:53.160]   Richard you before we got on and Leo likes to keep things live so that we can everybody can see what's going on back
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.120]   And then back behind the scenes you were telling me
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.120]   You were talking about the difference in culture at Google over the time you've been there
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.320]   We really interested to describe
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.840]   Life at Google over the time that you've watched it. Oh
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.720]   Yeah, well when I started there were seven thousand employees cheese
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:18.960]   You know, so it was it was a few years a couple years after the IPO and and I think every resume was personally approved by Larry Page and
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.500]   You know that you know you would get into the company and it was just and it wasn't all you know jumping on trampolines
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:31.280]   It was you know, it was it was actual real work and in 2010 there was an incredible meeting where Eric Schmidt
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:39.120]   stood up and said that because the company was doing so well financially they wanted to share that large S and that benefit with the
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:46.000]   Employees so he said everyone was gonna get a 10% race. Wow. So it wasn't it wasn't like, you know
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.980]   Like we're gonna do a spin-in or like give these people bonuses, but just them this was across the board, right?
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.400]   And that and and so there that was and I was in the room
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.000]   When he said that
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.480]   So that and that was in Mountain View and and it was just an amazing and he even said he thought he'd never been able to say
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.640]   Anything like that at any when he was the CEO at Sun or any of the other places said no bell I think
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.200]   So that was an amazing opportunity for him
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.120]   But now part of the reason was because there were only 27,000 employees at that time
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:23.320]   That that's why they were able now he couldn't say anything, you know, they're not gonna say anything like that, you know now
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:30.880]   So it then just contrasting that with what happened on Friday, right? You know, that's kind of like what all the other companies do. Yeah
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.880]   Yeah, yeah
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.640]   front of mind said that who used to work at Google he left a couple years ago
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.920]   He said people don't understand that Google it's highly hierarchical and like the Marines
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:48.360]   Would you agree with that there's the structure started coming in and Schmidt?
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.920]   Oh, we said our biggest challenge is gonna be we get too big which I think is part of the problem here
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:58.200]   I think that is part of like so one of the senior vice presidents is a Swiss fellow named Urs Holzig
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.680]   and
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:07.520]   Urs used to run the platforms team that I was on and I actually he was kind of brutal
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:14.840]   But you would you you would have these meetings every six months where you had to justify your products existence
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:20.800]   From a business case or he would kill it. What's wrong with that? Well, that I'm not saying that's bad
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.400]   I'm just well, you know, I mean you have a hard hard at hand
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.960]   Well, you're right. We're out. We've said at least I've said a gazillion times on here Google needs to be more focused and just
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.320]   Being all ADD with this product and that product. That's why stuff is dying off because there's no focus
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:43.200]   That sounds like he was focused. Urs is on the infrastructure team. So yeah, this was not an infrastructure
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.560]   So I'm just saying in general in general just the approach of all right. This isn't helping us
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.240]   Let's trim the fat and no
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.200]   I'm just saying that you would kind of go in the micro kitchen of the guy that just you know spent two years of his life
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.760]   That'll never get back
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:03.560]   You know, so I mean, you know, so there were some casualties of this sort of thing, but but yes, I do agree
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:09.640]   I missed I missed that whenever they whenever he got promoted to a level where he wasn't involved in the day-to-day
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.680]   management anymore and
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.080]   They backfill with a bunch of like academics were fake until you make it guys
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.120]   Oh
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.320]   And then and then you basically get things that should have died but didn't die because they're like oh well
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.320]   We have the money to do this. Let's see
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.520]   And then and then Ruth
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.280]   Talking about Diane green. Are you I?
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.240]   I'm not gonna say anybody in particular that I might be talking about whatever
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.040]   I miss Google plus Richard. Jeez
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.800]   Yes, no, I had 12,000 followers on Google
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.480]   Bring it back. Yes, I miss it. It was a nice platform
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.840]   But what what was what's your sense of how they went about this? Do you have any idea or was it a black box?
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.600]   You know, I'll be honest
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.720]   I have no idea because obviously I did not expect this you know to
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:04.720]   To happen. I mean like I have like about a thousand of these little tip notes that I write to myself about how to do things
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.560]   That were tied to Google keep on my corporate account. I'll never be able to access
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.120]   Right, so I mean, you know if I didn't know this was gonna happen
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.680]   I would have liked because that's there's no company secrets in there
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:24.760]   It's just me telling myself. Oh, well now me tell two years from now me how you type in the thing to do the thing
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:30.960]   It is my mother-in-law's birthday. Oh, no, that's good. No, I understand that
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.800]   I have a note somewhere that says how to set up an SSH public private key set lock-ins
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:43.160]   Kind of like a get at it. I can never remember so I can't get in a note and then I just pull up that note and
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.760]   So I understand that that's a they gave you no time to do anything
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.640]   I guess they don't want you writing nasty farewell in that
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.040]   Well, I mean, you know
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:59.980]   I think that Sundar even said that from the reason that they did it like this was because obviously Google is protecting a lot of very
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.120]   private information yeah
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:08.760]   Billions of consumers and they didn't want any you know, whatever they think of you as an individual
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.760]   They don't even want the risk of someone
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.040]   Yeah, we do that we do the same. We do that
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:13.840]   I mean I hate to say it
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.240]   But if we've had to fire people we've done the same thing you cut you cut their account access off
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.560]   Pretty standard operating procedures for least places you can
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.440]   And you know, I mean
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.480]   This has got to hurt what it you said you have some severance time
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.940]   Do they did they make you sigh apparently they make you sign an agreement not to talk to the media?
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.440]   Oh, I well, I haven't seen that agreement yet
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:49.960]   So since I'm technically an employee still I mean I think there's like a thing they ask you like when they do this
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.960]   What are they gonna do fire? Yeah
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:59.480]   They could take away as could they take away your cobra or something. I mean they might be able to do something
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.520]   I mean obviously I don't want to be and just as a legal disclaimer. I am not trying to give away any
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:10.320]   Secrets to world thing. Yeah, no no no in fact. We're not trying to get those out of you at all
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.440]   We're just trying to put a human face on something is so inhuman
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.920]   And so easy to report on but when you say 12,000 people lost their jobs
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.440]   it's
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:28.000]   That's a lot of people going through a lot of hell and I think it's I really wanted to have you on so that people could understand
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.440]   What it was so what's your plan now? What are you gonna do?
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:37.360]   Well, I will say I've been incredibly humbled by the response of so many of my friends that when they found out
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.120]   That they've reached out to me to offer me other opportunities
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.880]   I do new things. That's awesome
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:48.280]   So that does dull this thing whenever you know you're being reached out by other people to say hey, you know
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.520]   Do what you do just do it for this other outfit, right?
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.680]   But and there are a couple of really interesting opportunities there
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:01.120]   You know, I'm not saying I'm gonna go work for the Saudis, but you know, you know, whatever you're not on air
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.320]   They got some money and if they called and
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.920]   What what it sounds like your skills particularly in networking yes
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:18.560]   Yes, so I have worked on so and one of the things there is really no substitute for experience, right?
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.480]   So essentially I've seen many many many things fail
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.760]   So that that that allowed and I don't know if you're familiar with this
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:33.120]   But like all the technology companies have what I and I just you know, perverbially called the WTF meeting
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.000]   Yeah, where whenever you have 500 switches crash and
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.760]   70,000 servers go offline instantly and without warning
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:52.920]   You have you have this meeting where the service owners that are negatively impacted by this event are they come in and they look at you
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:58.240]   And the way I like to describe it is like it's like in this the original Superman with the guys on the wall
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:05.040]   You know where they're like you'll see you'll see you'll see and then and then you know
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.200]   It has to be unanimous Jarrell and then he likes to stick and they're in the Phantom Zone
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.720]   You know anyway
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:17.800]   So it's like that, you know in the meeting and then they say dude and then most Google services are actually dual-homed
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:24.280]   So that you know your Gmail is in two clusters and your calendars in two clusters. So if a cluster dies
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:30.000]   You can still access your email. So most users don't notice that even something bad happened
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.720]   So you can have this postmortem and something horrible happened
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:38.080]   But since nobody noticed then you get to play the a if a tree fell in the woods do the other trees laugh at it
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:44.520]   You know, you know, it's you know, it's Google down isn't trending on Twitter. So this is a nothing burger, you know that kind of thing, right? Yeah
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.800]   If Elon calls would you I think he might need some networking help would you would you consider going over there?
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.600]   Well since I did work on Starlink, which is one of his little base, right?
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:04.120]   The only way you can sustain by the way a 10,000 satellite constellation in low-Earth orbits where they degrade and fall back into the
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.360]   Atmospheric and they die within five years
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:11.400]   Is if you can dramatically reduce the cost of putting things in space which they have done
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.000]   Like it used to cost a million dollars a pound to put something in space and now it's ten
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.720]   So ten dollars ten dollars from from a million to ten dollars
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:29.680]   So whatever you want to say about Elon and you know his crazy antics
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.720]   You can say that the Falcon 9 is a is a is a machine
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.240]   Yeah
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   No, kid. Oh, wow. That's that's an amazing multiple
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.920]   right so
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.120]   How much how much severance did you say you got?
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.840]   Well, I didn't say but they're gonna pay me for the better part of a year. Oh
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:55.760]   Sundar's
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:01.940]   Statement on that right and so it basically they pay you 16 weeks plus a couple of weeks for every year you worked at the company
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.640]   And I worked there so long. Yeah, right and we should say you know
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.800]   According to the Wall Street Journal layoffs reaches high as the vice president level
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:19.520]   They completely laid off the entire area 120 team their blue sky R&D team. Oh, oh, I thought it was just a viscerated
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   It's all I think they laid everybody off. I'll have to verify that. What does that say about their R&D?
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.480]   well
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:32.200]   The people they ain't lay off were people who'd created a product that had then been incorporated into alphabet
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.600]   Yeah, but where's the next one the next one the next one. Yeah, so I mean this they're cutting
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:44.160]   It's not cutting to the bone when you're cutting only six percent, but it's cutting a lot of and this was my real surprise was because
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.800]   because the the statement for Sundar Pichai is you know, we really grew and
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.760]   and
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.440]   But the economy has changed so
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.840]   We're gonna we have to shrink a little bit and it implied that it was gonna be the people that we that grew
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:04.880]   But it isn't it's it's across the board and
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.800]   A lot of different levels and I'm so sorry that you Richard that you were one of the people hit by that
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.560]   It sounds like you're gonna be okay
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.840]   Well the way I look at this is there are two billion people in the world that make a dollar a day, right?
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:25.000]   So this is a first world problem. Yeah, right, but it's still a personal
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.320]   Thing and when you do live in the first world. Yeah, and when you work for a company for that many years
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.160]   You know, I saw one person tweet after 20 years
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.000]   When you're with a company for 20 years or in your case, what was it 17?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.160]   15 16 16 15 years. That's your that's a that's a mat
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:48.680]   Especially a young guy like you. That's like a big part of your life a huge chunk of your life
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.040]   You probably started there before your kids were born
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:58.600]   So I did start there when they were to to so they don't have any memories of me not
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.280]   Yeah, right. Yeah, so that and I think that I
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.160]   Don't know for me. It was always the case that a lot of who I
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.360]   Who I was and how I value myself in the world was my work
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:19.120]   So it hits hard regardless of the you know the financial impact or it's very philosophical view to say
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:25.240]   You know, I'm doing better than those other two billion, but it's still I don't think we should ignore how hard that must be
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.320]   To suddenly without any warning be told. Yeah, you don't work here anymore
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   Yeah, that is that is very difficult. I I will say I mean I am if I'm sad
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.680]   It's mostly I'm sad for the fact. I'm more than the company that Google is no longer that company
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:47.280]   So that's the thing that that I'm sad about I mean that well characterize that what what is what is the old
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.960]   Yeah, I'm here to the new Google
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:56.720]   That's what I was gonna ask is I picture Google is the the folks running around with bicycles and in in lollipops and ice cream
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:02.720]   Coams and just fun time and why they digging into the code and so on and so forth has it become a little bit more I
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.360]   Know
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.880]   Structured and squared off if you will
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.760]   Well, and I kind of feel like
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:16.480]   To some degree at you know the unicorns and magic rainbows was not gonna last forever
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.040]   I mean, okay that every company goes through phases
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.400]   So it was almost and I mean and you know Google had expanded from you know
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.760]   The 7000 when I was there to like almost 200,000 in or whatever it is now
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:36.880]   So you know that so that whenever they cut 12,000 people that's 6% of everybody, but that's still
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:43.600]   A lot of actual real people that that got impacted right so and and of course the way they did it
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.960]   Even though I don't even know if there's an easy way to do this
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.560]   right
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.680]   Yeah
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:56.800]   And you know so having been let go suddenly from a company very publicly being part of something like that is
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.160]   It's probably better than just being fired randomly one day all on your own, but
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.240]   Having everybody realize like being able to say it very
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.120]   publicly actually allows a lot of cool
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.760]   Opportunities to come your way where people never would have talked to you beforehand because they thought you were happily employed
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.760]   so I really hope that that comes and
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.840]   happens for you because it is kind of cool to be like
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.800]   Guys, I'm free anybody like me and then a bunch of people be like
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:32.920]   And you know because you were there you you were a giga-olm when it dissolved so you've kind of been through this
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:42.360]   Richard have you seen in communities like what's been happening with the Twitter engineers where they leave and they've
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:51.680]   Yeah, I think there was a discord or some other things that they were talking about you know where you can go and I guess you know
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.360]   commissory
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.160]   About well, yeah, this sucks and yeah, it sucks and now you get whatever, but
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:02.560]   But I admit I wasn't really I mean I was in the cork at Etc
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.400]   It's exes a and M and it was always a suck it up and drive on kind of place where you can cry
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.520]   Cry about spilled milk, but what's the point so yeah?
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.800]   Anyway, so that's kind of the way I'm approaching it is
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.160]   That this is actually you know like now I can write that book
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.000]   How are you are you gonna write a book?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.160]   Well, I mean I figured that you know some of these things like the WTF meeting maybe not everybody knows that those things happen right
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:32.000]   No, I think that'd be very interesting. Yeah, so you you screen play kind of a little
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.240]   You know like you change the names and the incidents and then you kind of make it not you know
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:42.040]   Like a based on true events, but not actual true and then you can you could even make a movie out of it
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.280]   Yeah, you know like cuz these are companies that everyone interacts with every single day
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.160]   But they never really see what happens behind me on the side of what you know
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.480]   How do you keep the wheels on the wagon right?
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.080]   I have I don't know if you've gotten to this point yet in your
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:05.600]   Your stages of grief, but but can you look back now on your 16 years at Google and kind of?
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.000]   Summarize
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   what it meant to you and and
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.280]   If there was a lesson to be learned except don't keep everything in Google keep account
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.160]   Yeah, well other than that for sure
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.600]   Because I never thought I was gonna get cut off abruptly like this right now
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:30.440]   So if I had I would have done things differently, right? Yeah, but you know the backup early and often in more than one place
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.480]   And you know I you know it's the cloud. It's it's all it's dual-homed. It's all good. I'm never it
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.480]   But unless they cut me off
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.800]   You know I think a lot of people
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.720]   Think well goog. I will always have my Google Docs. It's a good lesson
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.120]   Right. Yes, there's a lesson to be learned. Yeah, yeah
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:53.160]   Maybe not that other account where you just make a dummy account and you just copy everything into that account
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.360]   Yeah, so if this account ever gets blocked you still have that one right?
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.920]   Yeah
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.440]   Ask our very own Jason Howell
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:10.520]   Yeah, I was gonna say any any like even if you're a normal person we're seeing people get chopped out of their Google accounts for
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.840]   others Jason's thing. There's the
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:19.800]   There's the whole anti pornography thing where people yeah talked about on the show with parents taking pictures of their kids
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:29.160]   Yeah, I think a lot of things can happen including, you know mistaken item any any other lessons learned any other thoughts you have about
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:38.440]   Well, so I was that I actually was asked to go speak at a funeral last week for a friend of mine's father who passed away unexpectedly
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.320]   Yeah, and he he had worked at NASA
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:47.720]   You know where he worked on Apollo 11 and he developed like the camera system for Apollo 11
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:52.040]   And he worked there for several years, but then he decided he wanted to impact people's lives
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:57.480]   So he left that after about three years and he went and became a high school physics teacher
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.600]   uh for the for the rest of his career with his wife and she was also a teacher
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.160]   but my my takeaway from that was
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:11.960]   Working at nasa and working on Apollo 11 was amazingly impressive and it was just an amazing thing that he had done
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.360]   But it wasn't his life. Yeah
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:19.080]   And and so I kind of feel that way about my time at google. It was a good run
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.880]   Obviously, i'm disappointed in the way it ended
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:27.080]   But you know, it's it's it was an amazing thing that will always be part of my life
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   But it is not my life. Yeah
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:33.160]   Well, it sounds like you got a great attitude, Richard. I'm sorry that happened to you
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:39.320]   Uh, i'm glad you could kind of be with us and and and people can hear what it what it's like, you know
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:45.160]   And what the experience is and uh, and it's probably good good warning to all of us not to tire
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.720]   Uh, our personality is up with our job that they probably should be too different
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.520]   At least not our self-worth anyway
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.920]   Uh, Richard good. Good luck to you indeed. We appreciate it. Thank you. Have a great
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.800]   Great day. Stay in touch. Let us know what happens
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:05.640]   Yeah, thanks, bro. Yeah, I will let you know whatever I land whatever I land. I'll I'll let you know appreciate it
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.280]   I'll give you a ring later on, brother
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.760]   Okay, Richard. Hey, take it easy. Yeah, see you
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:16.440]   And then uh, Richard worked together at uh, jina smithsonu domain.com where Richard was a science editor
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:21.080]   And uh, that's how you know him and actually now I realize that's how I know I didn't realize
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.120]   Uh, remember reading his stuff
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.840]   Uh, yeah, I mean, it's a real shock for a lot
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.400]   of people, uh, I think at uh, google there was a
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.360]   uh, according to business insider a contentious town hall meeting on monday
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.680]   Uh, with sundar pachai and uh, remaining staff
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:44.280]   in uh, ch- google's chief people officer fiona chichoney was there, uh as well
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:50.360]   They uh, they were at great pains to say that it was not a random layoff
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:56.680]   That the layoff was based on factors like the company's highest priorities the employee's skill set experience
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.000]   productivity performance history, um, not every
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.720]   leader was told about this
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:09.160]   Uh, chichoney said in an ideal world we would have given managers like richards boss a heads up
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.640]   But we have over 30,000 managers at google. We just didn't have time
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.240]   To do it do that. Um
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.760]   People were a little upset apparently according to business insider
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.960]   Uh
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.840]   One employee asked about the communication strategy saying many employees didn't know who else was impacted
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:35.800]   Google did not share a list of people based on a principle of respect for people's privacy. This is rick osterlo
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:40.760]   Speaking who's uh, had of uh vice president of uh devices and services
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.120]   He said the company wanted to let people share their information on their own terms
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.480]   Which is why i guess i saw so many twitter posts from people saying
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.080]   Uh, it's a shock i'm not at google anymore after all this
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.680]   One thing i heard is that is that not everybody in the company knows
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.840]   Because in europe you've got to go through a whole different process, right?
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.320]   A place like france and germany
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   The people are still waiting for
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.640]   Access to fall. Yeah, this is elan musk learned
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:13.560]   Into his to his own uh chagrin that it's a lot harder to fire people in europe than it is in the us
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:19.480]   Um, so i mentioned uh jeff and i'll i here's the uh follow-up google
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.280]   uh lays off
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:29.480]   Most employees in the area 120 incubator tech crunch says there are less than a hundred employees left
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.120]   um
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:38.200]   But my sense is those hundred people are people who are who produced a product that google is now
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.000]   uh selling
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   so um
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.880]   This is the tech crunch headline google's in house incubator severely impacted by alphabet layoffs
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.320]   You people may not know an area 120 is it was kind of their rnd right they did
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.720]   A lot of interest some a lot of the interesting weird things that we talk about labs of google
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.880]   Yeah, right. Yeah
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.120]   A spokesperson told tech crunch via email the majority of the area 120 team has been
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.920]   winded down
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:15.400]   Or maybe they mean winded down. I don't know only three projects from the division will graduate later this year
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.880]   Into google product areas
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.840]   uh, the spokesperson would not say what projects are being
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.800]   Shuddered in which we're being graduated
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:30.760]   I should get figure out by going and looking and seeing who was left without me. Yeah a lot of people on linked in
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.560]   Uh, you know, that's another place you could go as search for the x for the they call them x-ugglers
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.640]   They got nugglers when you start zugglers zugglers
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.920]   former uglers
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.240]   Um
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.320]   Yeah, it's just it's hard. It's really hard and uh our sympathy to all of the
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.080]   It's now more than a hundred thousand people who've been laid off in tech
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.400]   uh over the last two weeks
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.800]   Yes for the part when was it?
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.920]   like early 2021
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.440]   When there was news of big tech going on a
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:11.880]   Hiring spree right have you or was it early 20 because of the pandemic? Yeah, right? Yeah, and remember that these companies
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:19.640]   Collectively made more than a million dollars in increased value during the pandemic pandemic was very good to some of these companies
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:29.000]   Right, and they were very necessary to us and good us. That's right. That's why yeah, do that. Yeah. Yeah among people getting laid off at google
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.920]   27 in house massage therapists
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.800]   Yes
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.640]   Uh
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.680]   24
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.680]   I mean because that's not a job you couldn't like
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.480]   Oh, I think you could find another job but you start your own practice or whatever we have
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:52.680]   Yeah, but that's a little alone has thousands of massage therapists. Okay, but in in a rough economy right now
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:58.440]   People are gonna skimp on that. I mean, it's probably rare to be an in-house massage therapist
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:03.080]   But it's probably a pretty good job. I bet it is. Yeah, I wonder what other freebies they're gonna get rid of
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:07.480]   I was thinking the other day they can't get rid of of meals because it's just too ingrained
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.640]   Boy, that's the first thing he loved it though. Those free gourmet lunches at twitter
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.680]   Gone and all those coffee machines sold
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:19.080]   Baloney sandwiches for everyone. Yeah, and bring your own toilet paper. Yeah
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:28.760]   Uh, all right anyway, uh, it says here are some breaking news. Yeah breaking news now this in from the professor of journalism
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.760]   Facebook and instagram are reinstating Donald Trump
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.840]   Well, we knew that was gonna happen. Okay. Yeah, we knew that was gonna happen
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.480]   So he's been reinstated now on all the main social platforms
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:44.920]   The issue for mr. Trump for so is he has an agreement with his own company truth social
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.800]   Not to post on these other places
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.320]   He's apparently trying to get them to let him out of that
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.760]   For part of this john betel said on on mastodon
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:59.080]   He said this is really about the ads trump needs to raise money and facebook wants the ad money
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:05.400]   And that's he s and so what so his ads can now reappear on these platforms, which couldn't before well and also if you're running for president
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.760]   uh
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.320]   Much better to be on a platform like facebook or twitter
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:17.240]   Then truth social which I mean frankly anybody who's on truth social is already voting for you. So um, yeah, you're a curse into the choir
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.560]   Yeah
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.120]   Uh, yeah, well, that's I mean i'm not surprised
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:26.280]   Uh, I mean I think they're actually far worse people that elan has brought back to twitter
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:32.360]   Well, he one came back and then got was gone a day later. Well conny for one
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:39.640]   No, that's one but also dick dick went us came back. Oh is nick fwent has already banned. He didn't take long already banned again. Wow
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:45.560]   Amazing story. I tell you he was the holocaust denier the anti-semite
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:50.520]   And worse, yeah, uh, and uh, so what did he get banned for he just was up to it again?
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.160]   No, the story is down there. What do you think? What do you think if you invite somebody like that back?
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.880]   You invited patsy back
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.880]   What do you think is gonna happen?
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.600]   twitter suspended the account of white supremacist and holocaust denier nick fwent has listened
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.120]   24 hours after his reinstatement on the platform according to the hill
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:14.920]   He posted a picture of his suspended account on telegram on wednesday morning with the caption. Well, it was fun while it lasted
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:20.120]   The 24-year-old leader of the american first movement had his account reinstated tuesday
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:25.000]   In one of his first tweets he posted a short video of yee
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Oh god
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.600]   Doesn't let me see if it says if the hill this is from the hill. Let's see if they say why he was abooted
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:41.240]   Billy b says uh shared a yee 2024 logo morphed into the message duffcon three on jewish
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:45.080]   reference to the disgrace wrappers tweets. Oh, yeah, yeah
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:51.800]   You know I actually have mixed feelings. I mean honestly, uh, we know how horrible nick fwent is is because
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.600]   He's doing it in public, right?
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.400]   So to some degree we talked about this uh on on twitter on sunday
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:05.080]   And I know I think jeff you probably also had this opinion as I did that well
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   This will be good because we'll lift the rocks and the sunlight disinfects and we'll know you know who these people are
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.400]   We just didn't expect that they'd find so many followers
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:19.400]   It's the old northern wendler brawler versus southern big argument that you least you know
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.640]   This is the argument when I was growing up you least you know what george wallace is and you don't know the norther
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.960]   Mm-hmm
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:32.840]   It's true. There's a lot of covert racism in uh in northern towns like boston
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.840]   And uh, you know boston is not covert racism
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:42.200]   Okay, never mind
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:50.360]   Uh never mind amazon is closing amazon smile
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:57.560]   Uh, this was the go ahead. I wish I wish they had just said look
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.040]   tough times
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.960]   Let's we're closing this down. We've given a lot to a bunch of places
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.280]   It's time to stop this. I mean, that's not a terrible message
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:14.440]   They made up some mealy thing like well, there's they were like too many people and too little money and
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:21.480]   And they were like these charities couldn't we couldn't raise enough to make an impact on everyone and i'm like
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.800]   you know what because like
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:32.440]   I had amazon smile for like our my kids school. Yeah, and they got like three thousand dollars a year
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.680]   Which i'm sure it was like
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.680]   That's nothing but the school
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.920]   $3,000 a year is great. Yes
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:47.880]   Exactly. How do you define um, uh, like what's it what's impactful? Yeah, a spokesperson amazon smile was launched in 2013
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:54.040]   Uh, 0.5 percent of the purchase price would go to the charitable organization of your choice
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.120]   I choose doctors without borders. Uh, I have to point out
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:05.080]   Though the real reason why smile exists and now I can't guarantee this is the real reason
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:13.400]   But there was a thread on reddit by a former smile executive, which was then later confirmed by another smile executive who chimed in
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.760]   that really the reason smile was created
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.000]   was because
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.800]   A great many people were searching for products on google
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:28.280]   Seeing the amazon ad clicking that and buying it which man amazon had to pay affiliate fees to google
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.920]   Of several percentage points, right?
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.960]   so amazon's
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.600]   Profit there's a whole group of people that these executives are part of whose job is
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:45.800]   To maximize profit. They said well, this is a problem because we're paying google millions and millions of dollars every year
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.960]   Because people go to google first. How do we get people to go to amazon first?
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.520]   They came up with this amazon smile only works as you know stacey if you go to smile
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:59.240]   Dot amazon.com in other words if you begin your search on amazon
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.640]   Your how it works
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:07.640]   So by giving a far point five percent a far smaller amount of money to these charities
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.480]   Amazon saved a much larger amount that it was giving to google
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.000]   So this is the reason amazon's smile existed. Hey, that's fine. It worked
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.040]   You know everybody wins the charities win
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:24.040]   Amazon saves a lot of money actually google doesn't win, but you know google's got other
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.680]   Other ways to make money
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.880]   I don't know though. I wish these executives had explained
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:36.120]   Why they were killing it because presumably maybe people aren't doing you know what maybe they're not doing that search
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:40.520]   Through google although I notice I do yeah, they've solved the problem. Maybe they solved yeah
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.800]   But don't you still do I certainly do when I'm looking for a product I google it and then
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.600]   And then it goes to amazon how old a smile
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   How old was it? 2013 9 10 years old. So yeah, I think you got a point today's here at that point was different now since people are in the habit of going to amazon
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.040]   So mr. Laport if it's something that you assume
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:06.920]   Is already going to be on amazon. You don't just search inside of amazon. That's what I do. I do there's something is odd
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.960]   I don't expect to be on amazon. So then yeah, I'll go to google but
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:15.160]   I remember to go straight to amazon. I remember going to google the google lobby
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.240]   Uh many years ago and they used to in the old days they'd have
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:25.320]   An a board in the lobby that said what the top google searches was or remember? I don't know do you remember to ever see that?
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:29.320]   Yeah, oh yeah, well there were there were kind of more random going by it wasn't oh no when I went there
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.280]   It was like the top 10 searches on google and number one was yahoo
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:37.720]   And i'm thinking what and then i'm and then I realized how normal people
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.200]   Use their browser. They don't type yahoo.com
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.240]   They type yahoo
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.240]   and then google
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:53.880]   Initially google would give you the result yahoo, but after a while google realized oh, yeah, you mean yahoo.com and we just pushed yahoo.com
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:45:02.280]   I think still plenty of people if i'm looking for i want to get a 300 count bottle of
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.960]   advil
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.960]   type it into their google
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:12.200]   And then oh, you know, it's interesting i'm getting walmart first maybe that's maybe that's the problem
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:18.440]   Maybe that's the problem. Yeah, then there's amazon after that
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.560]   uh amazon does beat walmart's price by
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:27.720]   20 cents no 25, but we all know you're not normal sir. So that's how people do it
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.200]   Isn't that how people are asking you dude?
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:34.600]   You just you just googled it into an eva search engine
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.600]   So
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:44.200]   Google but it's the same effect right actually that's a good question. Let me see if i go to google what what i get
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.680]   300 count
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:54.120]   Advil that's a really interesting question you think i'm gonna get oh i still get walmart and amazon
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.520]   Walmart's first all right
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.480]   Um, but again, do you get different pricing shopping?
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:06.200]   Same prices ramazon stuff. Okay, you don't go straight to amazon a search you i know i go to google
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.360]   I think normal people go to google for everything because they're not really going to google
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:15.720]   They're typing in or they just type it into their browser. Yeah, that i get and i'm most browsers
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:19.960]   And you that's why google pays 11 billion dollars last year to to apple
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:26.200]   Because on most browsers including apple's browsers typing in the browser bars the same thing as googling it
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:33.000]   And google makes so much money on that that they pay apple 11 billion dollars last year
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.240]   Whoever the traffic to google.com home page go there for that search box has to be small now
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.240]   Yeah, nobody goes to google.com
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.840]   But i'm like my wife is i'm researching the show every week
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.360]   Yeah, i am because google if i go to google news and type in google
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.360]   It's not so good
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:55.720]   I go in to the search bar and i type google and google thinks i'm stupid like you can't find google on google
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.320]   But when i do that and then hit the news button, it's far better
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.040]   Version of news interesting
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.720]   So you go to search bar and you type in google
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:08.680]   in google
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.880]   Wow see not everybody's like you smart. No, they're they're weird
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:20.760]   I'm not that smart but they're just habit they form habits and they stay with them. I mean, that's
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.760]   My father to you know, he hasn't been on he's 97 years old next one day
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:32.600]   So he hasn't been on his computer a few years, but he never got past understanding what a web browser was it was a oil
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.400]   right right
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:39.720]   Rines me gotta cancel that jesus still have it doesn't you have an aol account still
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.920]   I've been here is this
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.720]   You jeaned massed on at one point with money
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.800]   ladies and gentlemen i give you
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.800]   Interview with the founder of massed on you want to stay to the end
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.040]   i'm going to stay to the end
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.040]   He this is uh on the nightcap which is on cnn business
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.600]   And the interviewer calls him Eugene
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:04.920]   So I guess he's approved that use of his name which you call yoygan
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:09.320]   And I avoid the whole thing by calling him gargron which is his master don handle
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:14.280]   But here is here is a quick all the way that's like he just turned 30 years old
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   He's a young guy by the way
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.480]   Massed on now has made enough money through their patreon that they're hiring
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.080]   Uh actual developers. Yeah, isn't that great
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.800]   So here is a
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   Point was adding 130
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.200]   Should I just skip to the end here because I don't want to see it in the
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.400]   Yeah, yeah, i'm so free to twitter
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.560]   Has he been doing a lot of interviews i've never seen him before?
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.640]   No, he's not
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.400]   You're the only full-time employee and how many active users are there?
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.320]   Uh
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.320]   1.6 million
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.840]   Oh no more active
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.240]   You know as you said you're the one full-time employee right now
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:55.000]   And as of now you're the big competitor to a company run by one of the world's richest people
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.880]   Do you ever think you find yourself in that situation?
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.840]   No, it's kind of funny
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:03.880]   Uh, I make very little compared to that man
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:07.160]   If you had a message to elan musk, what would it be?
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.640]   Get off the internet
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.760]   I agree get off the internet
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:19.000]   Says yoigin the creator of masted on just get off our
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.840]   internet elan ill your account mr. musk
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.400]   Um
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.920]   elan may
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.840]   Really we we're not gonna talk a lot about elan is not that much news to report
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.360]   We did mention did we talk last week about the killing of the third party?
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.960]   Yes, yes, we did third party clients. That's official now
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.680]   twitter made it official at first by saying uh you broke our rules
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.440]   Uh to which twitterific and tap bot said wait a minute. What are you talking about?
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:53.000]   We've been doing this for 15 years and then they said uh and they changed their rules so that there are no third parties anymore
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.560]   I understand that you know he wants his advertising
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:00.120]   Money, but I do wonder what the endgame is now twitter's being sued
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:05.080]   By everybody this the landlord in san francisco the king of england
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:11.640]   Is is well the not not the king personally, but the the crown
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.960]   Properties are suing elan for the rent in london
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:22.680]   Uh the crown estate they call it. He's not paying his rent anymore millions and millions of dollars
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.600]   Yeah
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.120]   so uh
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:29.240]   You know you do that and you get kicked out after a while
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.880]   What's the what's the endgame?
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.280]   Is elan trying to go bankrupt?
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.640]   That's I've seen that increasingly this seems to be managed as though
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:43.240]   Well, they don't they fired the entire accounting department. So one theory is that nobody knows those bills exist
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.800]   Right
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:52.520]   Why are we expecting him to pay rent? He doesn't know anything by now. I think twitter knows that it owes rent by now
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.200]   It's a headline
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.560]   everywhere
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.840]   king chao
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.840]   sus twitter
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:03.880]   Advertising was down. They were admitted was down 40 40 per cent. It was down 70 percent
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.080]   Yeah
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:09.720]   So he's talking about having an ad free version charging, but if there's no ads anyway, you know why i put that on
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.040]   Uh, he owes 300 million. I think uh at the end of the months
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:19.160]   Immediately at the end of the month, but he's got he's got a 500 million dollar credit line. He'll make that payment
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:25.400]   But the way i was thinking about it is the is the creditors the the who will get the company if it goes bankrupt
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.120]   Will have bought it for 13 billion
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:31.240]   Which is not a bad price for twitter or the right price for twitter
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.920]   See how much you say 13 billion is what they loaned
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.480]   They lent to um
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:43.640]   There is still a consequence. So if he goes bankrupt most of that value is the other, you know, whatever that is
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.200]   Well, the equity is gone. Yeah, the 30
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:51.560]   But the 30 remaining 31 billion is is elons money or borrowed against test all gone
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.880]   But does that not first does that not just kill tesla?
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.920]   I
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:04.280]   He's trying to know the new report is he's trying to sell three billion dollars in in twitter stock
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:10.280]   It gonna bridge even if he got that but even if he got that that's a fraction
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:16.440]   Yeah, so the latest is trying to reduce the his intent. He just wants out right he's always wanted out
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.520]   He didn't want to buy it in the first place
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:23.480]   So his the latest you could theory is he just wants to go bankrupt
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.280]   And just kind of get out of it
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:30.840]   But there's gonna be a cost I would think you know what I don't understand high finance
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.040]   This guy's operating
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.080]   You know anybody that rich is operating at a completely different level
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:42.120]   Than you or I so I don't get it. I don't know but uh, I'm just wondering if anybody has any ideas of what's going on
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.920]   Stacey. What's your theory?
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:49.640]   Oh lord. I don't I don't I don't want to go into that person's head
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.680]   intentional bankruptcy sure, I mean
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:58.280]   I really don't know. I don't pay attention. Yeah, but you're still on twitter
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:02.920]   Inertia is a very powerful thing
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.040]   Do you um
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.440]   Has your twitter feed degraded in any way?
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:14.920]   I don't go to it like i'm only on to like I go to twitter once a day just to it's kind of like how I treat linked in
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.520]   it's no longer like
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:19.160]   and I I haven't gotten a mastodon because
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.200]   I've actually enjoyed not
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:27.240]   Having okay y'all here's Stacy's confession for the january month
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.440]   I I uninstalled tiktok
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:37.400]   I go to twitter once a day. Yeah, I haven't gotten on mastodon. Yeah, I have not a facebook or person
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:42.040]   I think this is healthy. What have you yeah anti-social. I've been saying this for a while
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:47.800]   I'm the I do go to read it still. I mean part of my job is to follow the news. So I
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:56.120]   To keep up on the news. I'll check twitter probably like you a daily check. I check reddit a couple of times a day
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.320]   But I also check places like hacker news
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:07.880]   Uh, I check pinboard for the most popular bookmarked things. I mean i'm looking for news besides tech meme
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:11.800]   I'm looking for other sources of news. So I but that's my job
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:17.320]   I don't really participate, you know, even on mastodon. I don't toot very often
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:23.800]   David carp for the same today. Yeah that he said that uh, it's a ghost town to him as he looked at the at the
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.960]   um
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:30.360]   Engagement he gets versus versus his twitter. Yeah, and I'm curious with you
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:37.400]   Mm-hmm is you be the one who's defended musk's intelligence. You know, there's got to be something smarter here. What do you think?
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:44.600]   Um, I still think if the bills do dad gummy he needs to pay his bills. That's
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:49.480]   I think that's his been his biggest problems. He's been able to get away with stuff in general
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:53.480]   Um even all the way up to the what is it the sec?
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.520]   um
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.520]   With all of the the tweets that he did
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.400]   Yeah, he's on trial right now for the for the uh
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.080]   acquisition
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:08.200]   tweet that funding was secured for uh taking tesla private. He's on trial for that right now
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.520]   It's not looking good for him on that either. I don't think
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:16.760]   It's it's it's a big one. I see it. I believe it when I see it because it doesn't seems like
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.680]   um, he's paid any type of price or penalty for any of his
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:24.760]   actions like that that caused um some tumultuous stuff
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:32.440]   But again from an operational standpoint if he feels like he can get some other folks in there to run that company and make it more profitable
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:38.280]   More power to him. That's just what CEOs do they put people in place and take credit
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.640]   Yeah, it's just um, mo isn't it so he's done all along it
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.440]   uh spacex and tesla
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:51.800]   I know and i'm still in broadcast mode with my twitter use. I don't necessarily check twitter anymore either
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:56.120]   It's literally stuff just being broadcasted out. Uh if I do
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:56:01.960]   Check it. I'm usually looking for something along the lines with my my son or whatever
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.160]   That's that's about it now because I don't want to go in there
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:11.800]   Just sort of scroll through and just see what the suggestions are because I've learned in the last couple of weeks that it's just a bunch of
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:17.960]   Mass that's depressing and unibother anymore as a matter of fact I had to tell a couple folks. I'm sorry
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:24.280]   Um, y'all got my phone number or i'll check in here and there, but just don't expect a lot from me
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.840]   on twitter from a um
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.840]   From responding, you know
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.520]   He seems have gone off his head lately in the last 12 hours
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.640]   He has changed his name to mr. Tweet
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:41.080]   And then tweeted I can't wait I can't change it back
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:45.240]   Hey, he's not supposed to be able to do that because he has a blue check beside his name
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.080]   And mr. Tweet
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.280]   Well, he could do anything he wants and then he tweeted the b emoji
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:55.400]   All you can be emoji be all you can be so and then he tweeted
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:01.560]   A poem half a bee philosophically must ipso facto have not be
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:05.480]   This is either somebody smoking a lot of weed
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:12.520]   Trippin balls or as long as my this is my company and I could do what I want today
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:23.480]   Yeah, he's just I mean he's he's troubling everyone. He's having fun. It's like a 10 year old boy. Yeah, you know, I agree
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.960]   The world. Yeah, and you know what?
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.080]   Awesome 44 billion dollars worth of fun. He can afford it
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:34.120]   You know, this is the thing people say. Oh my god. He spent so much money. He still has 132 billion dollars
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:38.360]   He could find he could not spend it. He can't spend the interest
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:41.720]   He's if there's any type of crimes. He's done
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:47.720]   I would hope that he would have to pay the price if he will he could pay all the prices he wants
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:53.320]   He's whatever those crimes are just like any other regular person would do the problem is he seems to just
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:57.560]   Keep living life and doing whatever the hell he wants to do because he's got that
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:01.240]   I hate saying it this way. F you money. He's got the jack man
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:04.680]   And the f you money is saying f you to him right now
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:09.800]   I'm just like mine. But again big deal, you know, none of this will have any personal consequence
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:14.680]   At the end of the day he keeps two billion dollars after it's all over. What a log that was that I can live fine
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.600]   Any floor I want give me two million. I'll be happy i'm being
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:24.600]   Let me be clear. I don't I don't have a problem with him being rich in a billionaire. I have a problem with
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:31.240]   Someone being rich in a billionaire and allowing them to not have to deal with consequences of their actions
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:34.040]   That's that's all except that he I mean
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:40.200]   I think he's in it. He knows he doesn't have to so that's why he can do whatever he wants. There's a certain freedom
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.160]   He's not hurting anybody is he?
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:50.200]   Maybe hurting some folks financially when it comes to dealing with share. They knew it
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:55.960]   Yeah, I'll screw them. They they thought they were gonna get rich of them. Yeah, they're the suckers, right? But that doesn't
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.280]   Well
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:04.920]   Okay, yeah, they they placed a bet. They were nice the bet. He would turn out to be a nag not a not secretary
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.960]   Life goes on
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.080]   Uh, it's been good. It's been good and bad for those third party
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:15.800]   Twitter clients tap bots, which made a very popular client called tweetbot
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:22.600]   Fortunately kind of saw the writing on the wall and they've been working over the last few months on a mastodon client called ivory
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:28.520]   They pushed it out this week into public. It's still they say early edition, but it's available now
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:35.880]   Uh, they do offer a free version, but most people will subscribe. I ended up subscribing to support them for 25 bucks a year
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.960]   It's a very nice app and it's interesting
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:43.640]   We're seeing a spike on mastodon since it came out like the biggest spike in a long time
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:48.520]   Uh, a lot of people were waiting for tap bots to put out ivory
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:56.280]   And are now joining mastodon so many people people like our friend christina warren saying now I can use mastodon full time
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:59.560]   That's all the ios though
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.680]   Uh, it's only ios. No, they'll do it. You know, they'll do
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:12.600]   I'm well, maybe not i don't know it. I think they'll I think it will maybe not maybe there won't be the thing is there's millions of mastodon
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.640]   Not millions, but there's dozens of mastodon. What do you like about real?
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.560]   Uh, you know, like it's moved. Yeah, it's nice. It's very slick
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.080]   Uh, it's missing a few features, but it has a lot of nice features
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:28.120]   There are other good apps too out there like ice cubes just came out on ios is very good
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:33.160]   Uh, mostly I think it's familiarity for people like christina who use tap bots for twitter
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:41.640]   Use tweetbot and uh ivory is tweetbot basically for mastodon and they go, oh, I love i'm home. Gotcha. That makes sense. Yeah
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:45.800]   Yeah, again inertia where we change is hard. Yeah in
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:52.360]   Spending brain cells. I mean it takes brain cells to change anything and spending brain cells on something
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.400]   Like figuring out mastodon
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:03.240]   It can be when you know if it's not a crucial part of your job, but I can see why you would wait the financial times
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.400]   Which to great fanfare launched and mastodon instance
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.360]   I patted them on the back and I said how forward they can have you how smart of you
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:18.280]   They shut it down already? Yes, you're brilliant financial time. We tried to run a social media site and it was awful
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.840]   Uh here goes
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.280]   It was awful
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.040]   Everybody must start
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.640]   Taking a crap on activity. What's fascinating about this? No actually aunt. What's fascinating about this
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.800]   They're not complaining about mastodon activity pub at all
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.200]   What they're complaining about is
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:42.200]   Regulation and interbial very liability compliance security and reputational risks are substantial
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.680]   And ever growing in unpredictable ways. I I kind of understand this I I was
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:50.360]   I was a little surprised when big brands started there on mastodon
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.080]   I don't know if there's an advantage to doing that
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.920]   I'm as big as you could be and still get away with murder on mastodon
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.240]   You know, I don't think it's
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:08.440]   Those though largely hypothetical these risks were judged serious enough to exercise management at the highest levels
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:14.040]   Those people are loyal at the highest levels. I can I hear this in a poncy british accent
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.240]   There's people I better things to do than clean up our mess
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:21.640]   Legal side is all again all that again times a thousand
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.960]   Thanks to some pretty draconian uk
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.840]   Laws
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.560]   Which really are terrible. Um, and I understand I probably maybe if I were in the uk, I wouldn't
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.400]   Be running it the guardian when the guardian started
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.200]   Comment is free, which was which was there very
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:46.120]   Open and pioneering effort to have comment their lawyers were scared to death
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.520]   Yeah, because of the libel laws of the uk and so on
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.160]   And alan ripper took a brave move to do it
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:55.320]   This is a really good example of why section 230 in the u.s
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.920]   Is so valuable for those who want to run these things
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.760]   The reason the ft doesn't want to do this and the guardian doesn't want to do this
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:07.400]   Is because they don't have section 230 so while they perhaps could defend themselves in court
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.480]   They still would have to go to court
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:15.240]   Uh, I have to tell you if there were if there were no section 230 protection and we're going to get to that there may not be in
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.880]   in months to come
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:23.960]   Then I wouldn't be running a mastodon or of forums are are twitter would literally ill would you literally?
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.200]   um, shut it down
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.200]   I think I'd have to our irc
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:36.200]   I think I'd have to because without section 230 if something somebody poses post something defamatory on mastodon
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.760]   Uh, I could get sued for it
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:45.400]   But more importantly if I pull down something defamatory and mastodon you said this again and again, jeff
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:50.280]   You know section 230 protects our right to moderate as well. Yes if I moderate
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.120]   I could get sued by the person who got pulled down. I routinely
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:59.560]   Suspend accounts. I suspend two or three accounts every week on mastodon
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.640]   Uh some of them
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.640]   Nice. That's that's nice
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.200]   Stay active. No, well, that's that's the job of a moderator
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.560]   And I love it that I'm master and I have we have very clear rules
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.480]   And it's some of the majority accounts are not on our server
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.760]   So I just simply suspend our access to it, but occasionally they are there was some guy recently on our server
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:24.280]   Who was it was interesting. I mean I shared his political beliefs
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:29.880]   But he's very anti-religious and he was posting, uh, I think very inflammatory
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:34.120]   Things I happen to agree with weirdly, but very inflammatory things
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.800]   And I thought this is inflammatory. This is not something I want on our server
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.280]   Carton party not what you want in your community
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:45.960]   So I suspended it, but he could without without section 230 he could easily come back
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.880]   And sue us and then I would have to defend it. Maybe I'd win
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.960]   But it would cost me something and and it would be a burdensome and if there were many of these it would be too much
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.360]   So maybe i would google argued last week and there and their brief to the supreme court
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.280]   Yeah, so we're waiting to see what the outcome of of this and i've changed my tune a little bit
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:09.000]   Uh, this is the case the supreme court is hearing called gonzales versus google
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:15.160]   Uh family of a young woman who was shot in 2015 during an ices attack on a paris club
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.640]   Are suing google saying
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.800]   their algorithms
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.160]   promoted
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.160]   terrorist ices terrorist videos
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:29.960]   And and and so they should be held liable to it. Of course they're protected right now by section 230 last week. I
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:33.080]   tried to contend
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.400]   That an algorithm
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.400]   Especially an algorithm designed
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:44.760]   To make more profit. Maybe should be something they'd be responsible for but I have been convinced otherwise
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:48.840]   Over the over the week partly by you jeff, but also just in general
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.400]   Because it's impossible to say what what the intent of an algorithm is
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:57.960]   And an algorithm is an editorial function editorial functions are protected right jeff
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.240]   Well, yes, but it's not
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:06.600]   It's it's i'm always cautious about trying to define it as media and editorial but basically
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:11.240]   Short answer. Yes, but mr. Laport you're not naive to think that
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:16.680]   That algorithm isn't in place because they're oh, let's figure out how we can blow more money
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.760]   Is more like no, they're there to make money is the place that we can make money and that
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.960]   Boddle you can have an algorithm recommending the best stuff on twit
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.680]   It doesn't have money behind it that makes all of his users just happy
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:33.880]   Well, and this was one of the there was an amicus brief from anonymous redditors that this room court actually said
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.440]   Uh in this case an anonymous
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:43.320]   Comment can be taken because these reddit moderators want to preserve their anonymity for good reason and the court agreed
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.840]   Which I thought was quite
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.840]   Open-minded of it
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.760]   they
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.160]   Basically said we use algorithms to moderate
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:56.200]   And we need those algorithms to moderate effectively and I think that that was
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:01.400]   That that was persuasive to me that that just because something's an algorithm
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:07.800]   In my heart that wasn't and to get add money that we're still trying to make a better experience in my heart
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.640]   I I feel like google has some moral culpability because their algorithm which is designed to monetize
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:21.800]   Promotes and radicalize seems to radicalize people or seems to make their videos more extreme because that's more engaging
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.400]   And in my heart, I think they have a moral issue there, but I think
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:31.640]   They're protected and they as they should be because they're so it's so hard to define
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:36.280]   What's a bad algorithm versus a good algorithm or what's a useful algorithm versus a profit
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.400]   Focused algorithm that we that that's a foolish
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.320]   Task
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:46.840]   Courts shouldn't be expected to have to decide that or a jury. It's impossible. So to protect section 230
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.840]   I think we have to protect algorithms
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:53.720]   It is very important. We all agree that section. I think that section 230 be protected
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.400]   Stacey stay safe 231 way. How about it affect your business?
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:03.480]   Um, well, we don't get that many comments. We don't have
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:06.760]   It wouldn't affect it very much because we don't
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:11.640]   I mean, I could always just shut down or moderate the comments we get on our website because we're mostly
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.520]   A newsletter and podcast. It's mostly
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:21.000]   Not user community although I would miss the comments because we have some lovely commenters. Yeah, so you just turn them off
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.400]   Um, big
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:26.200]   Sad. Yeah a big part of what you know
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:30.360]   So I from day one as a podcast or even before that as a just pure broadcaster
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:34.600]   I always thought that the real job was to build community not to build audience
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.600]   Yeah, but to build a community you have a community around what you do. We have a community around what we do
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.600]   And I thought that to facilitate it
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.840]   having a mastodon having
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.280]   Uh
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.160]   forums having a chat room having all of that
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:53.000]   Was a service that not only supported the community but helped build the community and so it was very valuable to us
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.920]   But if it's a risky thing, uh, I don't think lisa will let me do it
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:01.320]   Maybe we'd wait till we got the first time we got sued and then we then we'd take it all down
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:05.400]   I don't know but then the community strategy you have now as a financial strategy
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:08.040]   And that would hurt you
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.640]   Uh
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.160]   Well, that's an interesting point because yes, we have the one thing that makes money's club twit
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:18.760]   That's that's designed to uh support us and as part of club twit
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.680]   We have a discourse
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:26.280]   I guess we could turn the discourse off and still offer ad-free versions of the shows and the twit plus feed and all that stuff
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.720]   The discourse is what we would get in trouble for because of the comments
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:35.160]   There I feel a little say I mean I always have felt safer in the discord because if you have to pay seven bucks to be in there
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.560]   You're not going to be a jerk. Yeah
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.280]   And that's so far held true by the way
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:42.040]   Um, right
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.440]   There will be jerks who are willing about low seven bucks, but leo the the the
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.080]   Reddit thing you raised is that
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.320]   You know scooter wrecks
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.320]   Is he's liable?
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.320]   Yeah, he works there for free rax
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.640]   All of our it's not just scooter wrecks. We have
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.520]   Yeah, I don't believe ten mods in there
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:07.560]   Uh, and those mods also would be liable. Although if you're gonna sue you don't go after impocunious mods
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:12.280]   You go after the deep pocket. Oh, you know scooter wrecks isn't really rich
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.400]   I don't know what to say
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.960]   That's why he has the time to do this because
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.760]   You know
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:24.040]   Millions for good unlike elon musk. He's like, you know what i'll do
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.160]   I'll give back to the tech community that has given me so much
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:31.880]   I just I imagine him saying how dare you call me impocunious
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:37.320]   I say good day. So I say good day. This job
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.640]   Have you met scooter wrecks face to face? Oh, yeah many times. I love him. Okay, all right
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.240]   Um, we i love our hearts. You wear a top hat and a monocle? Yes, he does
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.160]   He's a gesture cat and a monocle away from being an evil
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.080]   um
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.080]   genius
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.440]   uh
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.440]   He uh
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:01.240]   I've met many of our mods they the time time will stop by and sit in the laughing
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.040]   And ask for president
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.640]   No, that see now that is just defamation right there
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.920]   Except I have pictures of them sitting in my lap. So i'm not
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.920]   No, they're you know, I am I am ever so grateful to our mods
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:27.480]   And you know there are people who just kind of step up and do it for instance in our forums our discourse
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.720]   forums
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.360]   Paul holder has just kind of taken over under his wing
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:38.440]   And I'm very grateful paul to you for doing that and you know he he keeps the thing nice and clean and running
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.960]   And I never even asked him to do it. He just does it which is wonderful
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:48.600]   So uh there are people I think what happens is people love these things and they want to keep them going and keep them gardening
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.000]   Yes, part of their is their community. That's the key thing is that is that you don't it's not mine
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.520]   It's theirs right right in fact. I uh, I keep an arms length from the irc
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:05.320]   I say, uh, that's not us. That's not us in fact that might be what we end up doing
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.560]   We would cut them free maybe
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.440]   And uh and see if if section 230 were to go away see like just say well
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:16.280]   You know where it's not us. It's just some but some fans run a place
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.160]   So you sue them
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.040]   Okay, so you're right there you go
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.720]   That's how I show my gratitude for all you've done
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.040]   All these years
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.800]   So, uh, I don't think you just signed off though. No, I'm just we wouldn't do that
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:37.240]   But I I don't know what would happen. That's why we we're we can't let section 230
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:40.360]   Uh go away. I what do you think is uh
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.880]   Is gonna happen here
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.680]   Supreme Court interestingly was also going to
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:53.000]   Review the two anti social media cases in florida and tex there laws in florida and texas
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.960]   Which are blatantly unconstitutional totally, uh in in contrary to the first amendment and they've deferred it
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:05.400]   They've probably taken it off this year's docket by saying well, we're gonna we want to comment from the uh white house
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.960]   What is what is the biden minestracious think?
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:13.800]   Which they I know I don't care. They don't care, but it's a way of them saying yeah, we're not going to do that
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.040]   One this year well with the biden administration is also shooting for 230 the left of the writer both shooting
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:23.320]   One goes after the shield one goes after the sword and yeah texas and florida they're not but it's gonna put them
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.640]   It puts them in a difficult position
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.960]   so
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:36.360]   The I think the reason the left and the right are so adamant about this is they think section 230 protects big tech
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:41.400]   And the most important thing I would like you to take away from this and everybody listening
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:50.680]   Is that it isn't big tech? I'm worried about now. I don't care if google has to struggle or facebook or youtube have to struggle
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:56.120]   It's going to kill the small people like us. Yes, we're the ones who can least afford
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:01.960]   All the lawsuits that would come if if section 230 didn't exist it isn't to protect big tech
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:08.440]   It's to protect the internet and particularly the grassroots nature of the internet. So that's really important
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.560]   I would sit in your lap right now. I see
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:18.040]   Because I well, I don't want to say this seriously is that god bless you last week you were going you were saying something
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:24.280]   Practically the opposite and and you you're open and you're flexible and you're changing well. I would respect
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.080]   in in my
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.320]   What's the opposite of defense?
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:33.000]   offense in my offense
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.600]   um
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:38.920]   I I was accused I hadn't changed my attitude about 230 but I did feel like
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.240]   google had some moral
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:46.680]   Response this is the problem is they have some sort of moral respect and this is also I see the problem is
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:52.360]   I understand why congress and the courts might say well, yeah, but this is reprehensible that google is promoting this content
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:57.800]   What can we do about it? Oh, let's get rid of this 230 thing and that's why I want to kind of decouple
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.800]   the two
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:05.400]   But you can't I think you can't decouple the two and that's really what I've come to the realization as much as I'd like to
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:11.240]   Because I feel also there's a moral responsibility that google has not to promote this stuff
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:19.320]   Right. It's like saying like you're in it's I mean, it's kind of like child porn and encryption. Yeah, it's it's that sort of
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   It's exactly like that. Yep. Very good
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:28.040]   Anyway, we'll uh, we'll watch with interest. I don't know what the timeline is on the supreme court in section 230
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:30.600]   They have they don't
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.760]   Have they heard oral arguments? No, they're just taking grief straight now. It's got briefs. Yep
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:41.080]   Uh, and these oral arguments are not going to be the ones from the do not pay chatbot. So
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:46.200]   Yes, right the do not pay chatbot. Oh my god
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:51.000]   Um, hey, I think it's a great use case
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.640]   It's an interesting test and the fact that the do not pay chatbot is now going to actually make legal arguments in front of a judge
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.280]   That we don't in a case. We don't know you about yet. I'm like
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.760]   Lawyers gonna protect lawyers
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:06.200]   And they're gonna say if you're not paying a lawyer for your defense
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:11.400]   Then you can't do it. I don't know that's interesting because constitution says you could defend yourself
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.360]   Constantly you don't have to have a lawyer
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:19.480]   You know what they say about that the person who has their own self as a client is a
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.600]   Buck full for an attorney
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.200]   Uh
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:27.080]   Yeah, there's currently no timeline as far as I know
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:33.400]   For these cases the amicus briefs had to be filed by january 12th. That's why they were all filed
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.160]   Um, but I don't know if the court said when they're gonna hear arguments
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:43.720]   So do we want to talk about the the government suing google which feels like a big google story
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:46.520]   But do we also want to have an ad yeah, let's do yeah. Thank you

[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:58.840]   so
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.960]   Yeah, it's interesting to watch the the
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:08.040]   Both the EU and the FTC and the states
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.840]   all going after big tech
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.880]   And uh, and really to some degree at least in the section 230 case
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:20.600]   We little tech guys are just collateral damage hot. Yeah
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:26.520]   Which particular anti google measure were you thinking about?
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:29.320]   Oh stasis is just getting back
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:37.000]   Sorry boiling water for tea. Oh, yeah, I had to get that caffeine incision hot water. Mm
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.480]   I know well this he said it was a long ad. Okay. Yeah, I was
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.000]   Did I say it was long? I did
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.400]   Yeah, you said it was gonna be getting in the show. I think it was a long
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:54.120]   Twit social ad my bad. Oh, that's coming later. I'll do that later. Um, yes
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.840]   um, this is
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.040]   So what is I'm sorry google seems to be I have to say
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.640]   On the one hand, I think we'd absolutely have to regulate
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:08.760]   Uh, any big company big companies forget tech big companies need to be regulated
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.600]   Otherwise you get an uneven playing field and for the fair market to work
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:16.280]   The playing field has to be equal everybody has to be able to innovate compete
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.800]   Fairly and equally and when companies get big they tend to take advantage of their size to
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:27.640]   Basically, unlevel the playing field. So this is part of antitrust is in my opinion
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:34.040]   Very important to having a free market society if you're going to have capitalism you also have to have this kind of regulation
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.440]   But at the same time
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.080]   Because it's not just the us. It's it's all these other
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:44.200]   Jurisdictions, I feel like it must be really hard these days to be a big company
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:49.960]   Yeah, well, this is the one I know I was talking about was the action on tuesday
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.200]   Which is the justice department and the eight states
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:57.400]   And this is what jeff and i talk about all the time with google which is where it actually does have
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:04.920]   A monopoly and it can abuse it which is an online advertising. Yes. In fact, they want they want google to
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.800]   sell off
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:15.080]   Uh, was it double click the ad double click. Yeah, the ad well the problem is that google
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:21.160]   Has i've always had stacie and i agree on this i've always said that google's vulnerable because where it holds a near monopoly is advertising
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:25.000]   And it runs both ends of the marketplace the buy in the sell side
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:28.440]   And that's what really it makes great efficiency
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:35.320]   But that's the problem. Yeah, this is the second soul one side or the other would that be enough? I don't know
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.400]   This is the second uh ongoing
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.960]   anti-trust suit against
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:47.240]   Google this is against uh google's online ad dominance and yeah, one of the things they want to do is have google sell off
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:50.600]   It's ad business remember google acquired double click
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.200]   Gosh, it was a 2015 it was a long time ago
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:22:01.400]   Uh that gave it really a complete dominance in the online ad market both as a buyer and a seller
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:05.480]   Um, of course the senate tried to pass
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:09.640]   And failed the american innovation and choice online act
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:12.440]   Uh google was fine in france
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:17.640]   Agreed to a 391 million dollar settlement with states attorney general for location tracking
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:23.560]   I mean, this is this is going on and on double click was in 20 or 2007 seven
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:30.680]   Wow, yeah, that's when that's when uh, Richard was hired by google. So we're talking to what 16 years
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:38.280]   Yeah, and yet they they I mean I guess even if something's been part of your company since 2007 you could spin it off
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.600]   I'm actually kind of sympathetic to this
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:45.560]   I think google is self-dealing because they're both selling the ads and buying the ads
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.440]   And not transparent and and complete yeah
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:54.280]   The justice department says google punishes websites that dare to use competing ad tech products
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:58.440]   And uses its dominance in ad technology to funnel more transactions
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:06.760]   To its own ad tech products where it extracts inflated fees in law to line its own pockets at the expensive advertisers and publishers
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.080]   So they're screwing every every
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.960]   Both the buyers the sellers everybody
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:15.720]   I think I think there's there's some merit to this
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.680]   Oh, there's there's a there's app. Next is actually started this business, right?
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:25.640]   But then google buying um what it said you want to say is tasty just doesn't seven they bought that look like
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:30.280]   Yes for 3.1 billion dollars. Oh what a buy. Yeah, what a deal
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.600]   So uh
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:39.560]   The government also uh alleges that google has quote corrupted legitimate competition in the ad tech industry
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:45.640]   By seizing control of online advertising systems and inserting itself into all aspects
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:51.640]   Of the digital advertising marketplace by eliminating composite competition through acquisitions
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:56.760]   And exploiting its dominance to push advertisers to use its products over those of others
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.720]   Um
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.360]   Google is the defendant not any individuals. It also calls for google to sell part of its ad tech
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:10.440]   Business, which i'm perhaps part of i think part of is right right to do that. I actually think that's that's correct
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.480]   Yeah
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:14.520]   Listen to me. I'm saying this about google and about regulation
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.560]   So this is the u.s. This whole shopping thing in europe made no sense about antitrust
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.640]   Right. This is the antitrust cases. This is the strongest one. I think yeah
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:29.880]   This is the d.oj along with the states of virginia california, colorado, canada get nirsey in new york
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:34.040]   And road island and tennessee so that's that pretty much covers
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:39.960]   Covers 90 percent of the uh of the states uh the big the big the big population states
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.800]   uh
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.920]   And I guess the concern is because there can't show harm to consumers
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:52.520]   Which has has been our standard of antitrust action that this will have a hard time
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:25:00.200]   But it's also the ftc and the doj have been really forward about being like we must rethink how we deal with antitrust
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.960]   So stacy i think it's different in this case. Sorry. I interrupted
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:06.520]   Oh, no, I was going to say so it's really important
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.120]   I think this will be a really important case to talk about like that whole strategy
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.880]   Do you think that harms consumers? Oh, well, no, that's that's where I think it's different in this case. Yes
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:18.280]   I think there's there's a there's I saw something today and maybe he's casey newton. I can't remember who said it
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.960]   Is that the consumer in this case is not you and me?
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.120]   jane and jeff
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.360]   uh shopper the consumer is
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.240]   The advertiser the media company the customer
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:36.120]   So if the yes, tamer gets hurt and I think that that's why they have a decent case here to say that in this marketplace
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:41.800]   There is insufficient competition. That's the essence of anti-trust and the customer is hurt
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.640]   So I think it actually holds to the old doctor
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:49.720]   it may I I think the argument that I've seen some lawyers take is that
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:58.680]   Over time we have focused on the consumer as the consumer as opposed to the customer
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.120]   So
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:05.640]   I I think it's I mean, I don't I don't disagree with you. It's totally true that the customer here gets hurt
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:10.040]   Um, but yeah, we have it which is different from as much about that
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.400]   Too big which is more europe. It's just too big
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:20.200]   We don't like big and then it's that it's impossible to define in this case if you can define a harm to a party
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:23.080]   Then you got something
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:26.120]   Yeah, I there's they're asking for a jury trial
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:32.120]   So I think this is going to go up against a bunch of normal people
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:38.520]   Uh, here's the thing. What here's the I think the clearest statement of of the problem from the actual
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:41.800]   pleading google DOJ versus google
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:46.920]   Google a single company with pervasive conflicts of interest now controls one
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:53.720]   The technology used by nearly every major website publisher to offer advertising space for sale correct
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:27:00.040]   Yes, right. There are competitors as you said jeff but google's totally dominant in that two
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:06.920]   The leading tools used by advertisers the buyers to buy that advertising space
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.840]   and
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:15.960]   Three the largest ad exchange that matches publishers with advertisers each time ad space is sold
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:22.280]   Google's pervasive power over the entire ad tech industry. It owns the whole thing
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:29.880]   Has been questioned by its own digital advertising executives. We we've read this email. It was a smoking gun email from within google
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:34.680]   Quote is there a deeper issue with us? This is back when they were thinking by buying double click
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:39.880]   I think is there a deeper issue with us owning the platform the exchange and a huge network
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:44.600]   The analogy would be if goldman or city bank owned the new york stock exchange
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.120]   Uh and robin hood
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:52.520]   So devil's advocate here for a second. Yeah, just devil's advocate to put to play leo for a moment
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:55.560]   Please the I think one of google's arguments might be
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:03.320]   That because that auction is going on from the moment you open up the browser page until the ad is served in those milliseconds
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.080]   that
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.680]   um, the
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:13.720]   Inefficiency of a of a truly distributed marketplace and and and trading florida essence
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:16.360]   Uh might itself hurt
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:22.520]   Media because it would lower the price for the advertising or would lower the value of the advertising because fewer would be able to make it through
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:26.440]   I don't know that I believe that I think I think you can create a network that works
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:35.320]   But they're going to argue probably that they by bringing this efficiency to that exchange. They created more value. Okay, but as the d oj points out
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.800]   Uh
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:42.600]   They create this friction-free wonderful system and keep 30 cents on the dollar
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:45.800]   Google this is from the d oj pleading again
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:52.760]   They keep 30 cents and sometimes far more of every advertising dollar flowing from advertisers to website publishers
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.760]   through their ad tech tools
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:29:00.120]   Google's own internal documents can see google word far less in a competitive market
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:02.920]   30 cents on the dollar
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.800]   That's a nice little business magic number. Yeah. Yeah 30 percent. Mm
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:15.000]   So they that's just like the app store. I think honestly the d oj wins this hands down
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.360]   The only question is
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.400]   Uh, how long is it gonna take? What's the remedy?
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:23.800]   Yeah
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:27.640]   Uh, you know they apparently want them to sell off
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:30.440]   at double click
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:34.600]   I think I should sell off one aside or the other there you go. That's what I think too
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.880]   They have to pick a side. They can't hold on the whole
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:45.880]   That's what I think is the issue here. Yeah, the other issue here is and I because when back when they bought double click
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:48.360]   I think their ad revenue
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:51.000]   Was 98 percent of revenue from the company
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.440]   That's now down to 80 percent. They have diversified a lot
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:57.880]   Well, it's not because the ad revenues gone down is because they have diversified
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:04.200]   Through hosting and other things which is really interesting to see how google has changed as a company too
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.960]   I'm not a lawyer, but if you read this complaint
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:11.160]   It is I think pretty compelling
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:15.800]   Uh and there and the d oj has lots of evidence including, you know emails
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:20.360]   That uh, it just listened to stacy and me they would have gone this years ago. Right? Yeah
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:22.840]   Yeah
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.840]   We're totally qualified right? Yeah
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:28.760]   This to me is exactly how anti-trust should work frankly
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:34.840]   Uh, this is where a government should step in and say yeah, no you can't you got it. You got a diva diva
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.120]   Divest
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.520]   Say yeah, no, that is exactly what cover
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.520]   No, yeah, no
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.760]   In a colloquial fashion. Yeah, no
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:45.800]   But but eight years ago
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:52.920]   The tech companies were a lot more popular now. It's a perfect time to do it politically because everybody's going after the big companies because they're too big
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:55.080]   right
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.440]   Um
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:02.200]   There's still going to be stupidity in this business journal says the feds are saying google has to be broken up
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:04.200]   I don't I think that's not quite
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:07.240]   What they're saying
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:12.440]   They're saying we have you have you have to not a stubble deal like the best. Yeah, I don't think that's
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:15.080]   That's breaking breaking them up
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:20.200]   But but they just think you know, I think this is completely legit. I I have to say
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:24.120]   You're gonna have to talk me out of the merits of this case cause
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.920]   Yeah, it seems completely legit
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.920]   We've talked about those layers
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:33.080]   We've talked about this for years about this kind of double dealing
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.560]   situation
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.560]   Well and two it's a case where
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:43.720]   If you're gonna talk about monopoly situations again monopolies are not illegal if you if you earn your monopoly you can have it right
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:47.160]   But in this case
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:51.480]   They're vulnerable because their control percentage of the ad market is so tremendous
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.920]   Everybody concentrated on how much they control the search who cares, right?
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:32:01.080]   It didn't matter and they don't you know, they're rightly very worried about chat GPT. I will get to this a little later on
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:04.520]   Ben Thompson excellent piece in
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:10.520]   Statecria, I think it's subscriber only, but I have it is surprisingly. Yeah, uh on ai
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.600]   And the big five he calls it. We'll talk about this in just a little bit
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.360]   This came out a few weeks ago
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:21.400]   But his he thinks Microsoft is best positioned to take advantage of things like chat GPT
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:24.920]   We learned this week that the 10 the
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:30.120]   10 billion investment that was rumored that microsoft it was going to put into open ai
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:35.640]   Is actually in fact the amount that microsoft had started to open ai with a billion dollar investment
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.840]   They're going to now add another 10 billion and in return for that
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:42.120]   They're going to put open ai and microsoft products like microsoft office
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:46.280]   But but Ben thinks the real strength will be in bing the microsoft search
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:51.080]   And that's why google is calling you know saying red alert red alert
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.640]   Uh, just disagree
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.640]   Just disagree, but we'll see
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:33:01.720]   We'll see I had I had breakfast with somebody as I say from google this week and and and he was
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:07.960]   Saying and this is he's not involved in this. It's just you know, so yeah, I was part guy over the google
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.440]   And still works there uh
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:15.720]   Who was saying that well well chat GPT and such cannot be involved in science unless they give sources
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:17.880]   I said chat GPT doesn't give any sources
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:21.560]   And and so there's there's two questions there right there's the kind of where did you get it?
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:25.480]   Which is a discussion we had last week was this inspired by this artist or that artist?
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:27.960]   But then the second is
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.960]   If you present a fact
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:36.280]   Does the engine give you back up for that fact? That's a whole other process which I think can be created
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.680]   Reportedly google's doing that but chat GPT as it is is worthless
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:44.680]   Yeah, worthless, but nobody's
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:49.000]   No, but he's saying that's what's gonna in fact I showed you nieva, which does do sources
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.960]   Nobody's saying that that's how bing is gonna do this
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.640]   uh
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:54.200]   I
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:01.400]   I and really I think the only real question is does google have a comparable product is lambda or whatever it is google's gonna be using
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:03.960]   can they meet the
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.880]   effectiveness of chat GPT like
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.480]   AI
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:11.480]   If bing starts using it, I don't think bing is just gonna put chat GPT on the front page
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:13.080]   Jesus
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.360]   but but uh
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:18.600]   Look chat GPT just passed the worton mba exam
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:21.240]   An exam
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:25.000]   Well, it passed in exam given by a business professor
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:25.720]   Yeah, yeah
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:30.600]   Business professor says these new research conducted by a professor of university of pennsylvania's worton school
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.840]   Which is donald jay trump's alma mater
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.160]   I had found that the artificial intelligence driven chat bot gpt
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.560]   Was able to pass the final exam
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:43.320]   for the school's master of business administration program
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.600]   dang
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.920]   I don't know business business is not like the critical thinking is not important there
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:57.400]   You sound like lust is gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. No, I'm not saying it's gonna be fine
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:00.520]   It's not gonna take over. No worry. It's gonna be fine
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.960]   Okay, I don't think the AI is going to take over
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:09.320]   I think we will have to learn new ways much like we've learned new ways to collaborate on search. I mean
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:15.160]   We we constantly have to adapt that is what you have to do in life
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.960]   And so adapting to gpt makes sense
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:20.120]   and recognizing
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.080]   how to
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.560]   Restructure a business exam so kids can't
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:25.560]   so
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:27.960]   Business students who are not necessarily kids
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:32.840]   Don't just use it without learning whatever you're trying to teach them unless that is
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:36.680]   Maybe the fall maybe the fluzzy exam. It's a productivity boost. Yeah, maybe the fluzzy
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:40.920]   Yeah, the whole point of the exam is is is uploaded. Yeah, there was so clay shirky
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:44.040]   Who's at NYU was interviewed on NBC today
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:49.000]   And it was asked you should teachers panic and he said it's a word calculator
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.640]   Which I loved right I think it's a great way to put it
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:01.080]   But also interesting these tasty to your point. I saw there's this wonderful woman. I have it in the rundown
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:07.320]   Young woman who talks about AI all the time and she's just found a job listing for
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.200]   prompt engineer
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.640]   Nice
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.640]   Good pay by the way nice
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:20.360]   We said that was gonna happen right that's where it heads. That's where the educators here's the uh, here's the lead
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:26.680]   From a New York Times article of a couple of days ago while grading essays for his world religions course last month
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:34.520]   Anthony almond professor philosophy at northern michigan university read what he said was easily quote the best paper in the class
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:38.680]   It explored the morality of burka bands with clean paragraphs
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:43.480]   Fitting examples and rigorous arguments a red flag instantly went up
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:51.320]   Mr. Almond confronted a student over whether he'd written the essay himself the student confessed to using chat
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:54.600]   GPT and in this case it has written the entire
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.200]   paper
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:01.800]   Alarm by his discovery mr. Armin decided to transform essay writing for his courses this semester
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:09.560]   He plans to require students to write first drafts in front of him in the classroom using browsers that monitor and restrict computer activity
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:14.920]   In later drafts students have to they can take it home home them, but they have to explain each revision
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:19.400]   Mr. Almond says he also may forget forgo essays and subsequent seminars
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:25.400]   And plans to weave chat gpt into lessons by asking students to evaluate the chat bots or services
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:31.880]   Yeah, that's the spark that and I also think as we encounter this more often
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.800]   We will start to recognize a little bit like I feel like
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:40.280]   I now twig to win something
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.000]   Looks like it's um
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000]   Oh, god. What's the the ai um the vision one like stable diffusion or midjourney or
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:53.960]   Molly midjourney or any of those I feel you know like a little like a little antenna goes up
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:38:00.360]   I'm like wait a second is this real and I think we'll get that when we start seeing more and more chat gpt
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.800]   And if you'll start recognizing it for what it is
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:10.200]   I hope maybe I hope so here's Ben Thompson's piece ai and the big five
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:13.320]   His contention is that ai
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:16.200]   Is introducing a new
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:19.720]   epic epoch how do you say it epoch epic epoch?
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:22.440]   I say epic, but I feel like it's a
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:27.160]   Always thought it was epic. Yeah, let's find out. It was epoch. Okay. Hold on
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.640]   Let's see what chat gpt says happy gpt has us
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:39.400]   I can't spell this book. Oh you haven't uh mariam webster says epic epic epic epic epic epic epic
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:43.560]   Oh, I say that do the British too. I say epic but only because um
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:50.200]   If I if I say epic it sounds like epi see and I want to say epoch epoch
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:54.280]   Which is also accepted sounds like it's a because then you know what it is
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:39:00.360]   Dp och anyway a new epoch a new era. Let's wait. Let's use the word era in computers
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:03.080]   He says the first one was the pc. That was a disruptor
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:06.760]   Then the internet he says cloud computing
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:12.120]   And then mobile clearly mobile disrupted everything starting with the apple iphone in 2007
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.320]   Disruptive innovations
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:21.640]   Do consistently come from new entrance in a market rights ben but those new entrants aren't necessarily startups
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:25.960]   Sometimes their companies leveraging their current business to move into a new space
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:30.200]   So this is the question is uh is chat gbt
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.680]   Gonna transform
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:38.600]   Uh, I think it is then a new epoch or era in computing, but who's gonna be the winner in this?
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:42.120]   Uh, he talks about apple amazon
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.000]   Uh google and meta, but he says really he thinks microsoft is going to be the big winner
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.840]   Uh, oh
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:55.160]   Do you think the $40 a month bill that they were proposing?
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:57.960]   Uh chat gpt was proposing is is
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:05.800]   Okay, seems like that's a little low based on previous discussions about how much compute power and cost of that
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.600]   It was to them seems like that's a little number
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:12.920]   It's gonna be a real license. I think I think we over focus on chat gpt
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:19.400]   There are plenty of other things that do this. There's there's tons of stuff. Let's not let's not say chat gpt
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.640]   But in general, yeah, they just didn't build brilliant PR by releasing it the way they did
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:28.360]   Well, and it's and it's opened our eyes as a president stable diffusion, right? They opened our eyes
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:31.000]   All right, right, what a I could do, but there's gonna be others
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.640]   And there's probably gonna be better
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:38.200]   Right one of the things chat gpt relax is it it it's frozen in time
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:44.680]   But it's completely possible to write one that's constantly just like google spidering the internet for new content
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:50.280]   Yeah, so that it's always up to date that would be another thing and yes, that should cost more because that's a that's an expensive process
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.920]   the reason Ben thinks microsoft he says
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:41:00.920]   Uh is going to be the winner here. Well, I'll read the whole paragraph microsoft meanwhile seems the best place to vall compared to the other four
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:04.920]   like AWS it has a cloud service that sells gpu
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:07.240]   that's a big deal because
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:11.000]   Current models require lots of storage and fast processors
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.640]   Most people don't want to invest in those fast processors for something they're only going to do once in a while
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:19.160]   So they rent it from Amazon or google as a service right?
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:25.080]   And and microsoft's one of the in fact microsoft is the exclusive cloud provider for open AI
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:29.320]   He says yeah, that caused microsoft a lot of money. It's incredibly expensive to your point
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:37.000]   And but given that open AI appears to have the inside track to being the AI epochs addition to this list of top tech companies
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:42.920]   That means microsoft is invents investing in the key infrastructure of this new epoch
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:48.600]   Bing and this is an interesting one. I thought is meanwhile like the mac on the eve of the iphone
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:54.600]   Like the mac which was a driver for apple until the iphone came out
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:42:00.120]   Yes, bing contributes a fair bit of revenue, but it's a fraction of the dominant player google
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:04.200]   And it doesn't really mount too much in the context of microsoft as a whole but
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:08.600]   If incorporating chat gpt like results and let's not say chat gpt
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:16.920]   But something like that into being risks a business model for the opportunity to gain massive market share. That's a bet well worth making
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:19.560]   We know
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:23.720]   Microsoft has admitted that gpt is coming to microsoft productivity apps
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:32.360]   They're already using gpt and co-pilot on github and despite the controversies. It's it's been pretty successful. I think
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:36.440]   Um, what's important is that adding on new functionality
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:41.960]   Perhaps for a fee fits perfectly with microsoft's current subscription business model
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.760]   And it's notable the company once thought of as a poster child for victims of disruption
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:53.560]   Will in the full recounting not just be born of disruption but be well placed to reach greater heights because of it
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:56.520]   uh, still okay
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:02.840]   Well, I think we're gonna wait and see but if I think just the threat to b to google from bing by itself
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:07.400]   Is a is a big story he compares google house is going to become more valuable than
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.360]   There why the atle real estate. Oh, I should move up there quick
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:15.960]   Uh, he talks about eastman kodak
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:23.560]   They see he's coming he says he says, you know kodak is often the poster child for the innovators dilemma, right for
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:29.080]   uh being disrupted, but he said in fact kodak did it right
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:36.440]   It took over 25 years in the time of the digital cameras invention for digital camera sales to surpass film camera sales
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:41.960]   It took still longer for digital cameras to be using professional applications kodak made a lot of money in the meantime
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:47.000]   Paid out billions of dollars in dividends. Yeah, sure they went bankrupt in 2012, but
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.680]   That was because customers had better access to better products
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:56.440]   And uh, they didn't need them, but they could have done something different. They could have been netflix and been in the red
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:59.560]   Business and the streaming. He says not really he says
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:02.040]   uh kodak's
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:07.160]   Kodak even if had kodak kodak in fact had digital cameras at the very earliest. Yeah
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:12.520]   But but they would have been foregoing all of that 25 years of profit
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:16.520]   To uh, so you're just saying get out as much money as you can
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.840]   Because they weren't guaranteed to win that race the digital camera race, right?
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:25.480]   Yeah, so they would basically saying i'm gonna bet on this race and put all my money in digital
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:27.800]   This is what met is doing by the way with vr
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:32.200]   Put all my money and meanwhile forego all the profits of 25 years
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.160]   For this kind of weak bet
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:40.200]   That's a pretty big gamble. He says kodak actually shouldn't be the poster child for failure
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:43.480]   This is this this is the best you can get when you're when you're well
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:46.040]   That's a very shareholder perspective
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:50.280]   If you are the CEO of kodak and working for shareholders sure
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:56.520]   Give it but if you were thinking about the employees or somebody who's trying to create and operate a business
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:00.360]   Well, you had a fire all of those people doing film
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:03.800]   Developing processing you have to bring them through
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.640]   Okay, I mean you wouldn't have to fire
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:13.400]   Everybody in 25 years is a long time. You could you could ease people out the point is I mean
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:22.040]   Under that rubric. Yes kodak is a success. I would say a better look at like the innovators dilemma would be something like verizon
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:25.640]   Or actually, you know what a better example is
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:31.480]   Cast in cable in verizon like the de like the broadband companies
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:37.720]   and the encroachment of broadband on their wire line business which used to be their cash cow
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:42.600]   In profit center because they had put all this stuff in and they could just keep making money off of it
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:48.040]   And what you saw was them push as far as they could making money from
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:54.360]   Both and then gradually expanding the market like the pocket share that they had of your revenue
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:57.320]   From broadband as people cut their landlines
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:58.840]   So
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:05.960]   If you notice you used to spend about 150 bucks a month for your landline and your cable and your broadband
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.840]   Maybe 200 now you still spend about
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:12.840]   150 bucks or 200 you just only have broadband
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:17.720]   That's good point. They've done it. They've done it right
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:23.880]   Uh dwindle asked by the way chat gbt to write a story uh about us
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.520]   I see it
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:31.480]   Once upon a time leo loport jeff jarvis ant prout and stacey higginboth and we're all hosting a
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:38.680]   Technology podcast together. They were discussing the latest advancements in the industry when suddenly the studio's power went out
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:45.320]   The four hosts quickly went into problem solving mode using their extensive knowledge of technology to find a solution
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:50.360]   They managed to fix the issue and continue the podcast without missing a beat the ad
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:56.840]   And q to pgne cut now it wouldn't be us it'd be jammer be
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:00.280]   And it'd be bonito
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:07.800]   It would be a rustle rustle tarmony wouldn't be us you have a generator there no
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:11.080]   We so
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:13.080]   Of course when I worked at tech tv
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:17.160]   Uh, there was a lot of redundancy that we put in a building
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.120]   Capable generator that would keep us on the air
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:23.080]   Setra etc. Etc
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:28.120]   Then the power went on diesel running on diesel then the power went out
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:30.600]   I remember vively because i'm standing on the set
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:35.400]   We're in the middle of a show live show lights go out first thing first sign of trouble
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:42.760]   And then we had cameras on gybs that were you know on on crane arms. They were powered and then camera went
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:47.240]   Just just drooped
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:49.160]   And I thought oh
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:54.840]   This is bad. I heard the generator in the back this thing was a big diesel like a Cummins diesel engine go
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:59.320]   Yep and nothing
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:03.720]   Oh
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:04.840]   Anyway
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:09.720]   Having learned that lesson you spent a lot of money for complete redundancy and you know
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:15.640]   But I decided when long ago john that this the twit was not mission critical
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:20.600]   Then if the power went out we just go our cease is otherwise sir
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:23.480]   Wow
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:25.720]   If the power goes out
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:29.720]   No harm no foul. We go home now at least it doesn't like this at all
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:34.680]   She says yeah, but we got ads and blah blah and but the cost of being fully redundant is insane
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:40.360]   We just spent and I against my better judgment 23 000
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:43.480]   to have
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:49.160]   We had a power outage. I don't know if you remember it wasn't on the air, but the we have a thing for our audio
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:50.920]   Uh
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:56.520]   Our audio is based on a system called teles axia and this the power thing that powered it went died
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:58.520]   Well berg was here
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:03.800]   Yep, john was late last year. Yeah one sunday overnight something like that. Were you here john? Okay
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:09.960]   It went out. Anyway john runs in everybody runs in always here. We cycle it. It's back, but they scared everybody
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.600]   so
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:14.600]   My position was so what?
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:17.400]   Just
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:20.440]   You know
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:25.400]   We send for another one that they fed exit the next day. We're back on big deal
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:26.840]   Oh, no
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:31.160]   So we just spent 23 000 to replace it with the latest and greatest
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:36.920]   Which we now have to wire up and stuff and and I said after that, you know, I was told what we're doing it
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:42.600]   I said, but what about all the other systems for which we have no backup including power
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:47.720]   And I mean how many systems what if the tricaster dies? What do we do?
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:50.600]   Do we put the second tricaster online?
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:54.200]   Yeah
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:56.520]   We have the all call it
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:58.680]   Well, you know what we do leo you know, i'll tell you what we do
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:49:59.560]   but
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:03.560]   You go you use your laptop. You go find one and we all call into a zoom call
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.080]   and
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:06.040]   and
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:08.040]   You we brought that
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:15.880]   Yeah, yeah, I'd go to my hat. No, we actually we do have the different one time. Yeah, I did it. Well for the wildfires
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:18.760]   um
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:24.280]   When we thought they were approaching us we we made a plan that I would go home and do the show and I even did a twit
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:29.480]   I don't know something actually was that when the power that was when the axia went out. That's when the power went out
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.480]   Yeah
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:44.120]   All right, anyway, this is not mission critical. No one's it's not a hospital. No one's it is to us leo
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:50.040]   Well, i'm with leo. I'm like, oh, yeah, if it is waffles like power out
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:52.040]   Waffles, okay
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:54.200]   Hey, this is breaking news just came in
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:51:01.960]   Oh, this is a tweet from a divergence erin earlier this evening kevin rose who of course is a good friend of the network
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:04.440]   one of the founders of
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:13.720]   What are the early guys at tech tv boy was fished into signing a malicious signature that allowed the hacker to transfer a large number of high value tokens
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:17.880]   Here's a breakdown of what happened our immediate response our ongoing efforts
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:21.560]   He was socially engineered into a false sense of
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:26.600]   Security kevin has tweeted since I was just hacked
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:30.520]   This was at 1102 this morning stay tuned for details
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:38.680]   Please and this is really important everybody. Please avoid buying any squigglers squiggles squiggles until we get them flagged
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:42.280]   I don't that means yeah, sure. Yeah, sure don't buy okay
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:45.800]   Don't buy any squiggles until we get them flagged
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:49.960]   He lost 25 and a few other nft's including an auto glyph
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.280]   So there i'm sorry. I don't want to laugh at kevin's oh, you know what I will say in line with this
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:52:02.760]   We saw one of the I was looking at I get a bunch of annual reports and predictions from cyber security firms
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:11.880]   Um one of their big predictions that they are starting to see and will continue to see they think is people using chat gpt to socially engineer people more effectively
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:19.480]   Which is an agent? I got a good one. Yes. We covered this yesterday in security now people writing malware working
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.120]   malware
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:28.280]   On chat gpt with chat dpt people with no coding experience and it works. Oh, wow. Dang
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:36.200]   Well, I guess if it works for that patch that he and he found the other week for a lot was it for last past the
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:42.520]   That just did the the ue the gooey coding and stuff, but yeah, I mean it can code it can go. I know well
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:49.480]   Uh anyway, uh, I'm sorry kevin that you lost according to his friend pregger as much as a million dollars kevin made
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:53.080]   50 million dollars sending selling digital moon owls
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:53:00.520]   So he's I don't think he's gonna be hurting. I'm sorry, but you know what I feel like live by the crypto
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:07.560]   Uh, die about crypto. I this is not this happens. This is an unregulated
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:10.120]   financial instrument
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.120]   uh, which is a
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:14.200]   non-stop hack fest
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:19.960]   Uh, I'm sorry. He was on the cover of what was it was a business week that was for a dig the 30
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:21.480]   What did they say he was gonna be worth?
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:26.760]   Well, kevin always laughed at that because he said he was worth 30 million with dig dig end up
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:30.360]   I don't think he made a lot of money on dig it ended up, but now he is
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:34.280]   He made a lot of money investing early in twitter and other
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:37.080]   Early companies. He was a
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:42.280]   Yeah, no, he was an angel. He wasn't he ducked it fine. He was at google ventures for a while as a vc
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:49.480]   Uh, I think he's at true ventures now as a vc, but of ladies really gotten into defi crypto nft's made
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:52.200]   He is he didn't make it, but his
[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:55.880]   Solana his group made uh, 50 million dollars
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:00.280]   Uh, the group include beeple who's probably the number one nft artist
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:05.080]   They made 50 million dollars selling their digital owls nft collection
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:07.720]   And uh, yeah
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:10.920]   He made so much he made so much money that he had to make a video
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.400]   Saying look, I'm not gonna
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.560]   We're gonna put the we're not
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:20.120]   We're gonna spend we're gonna do this. We're gonna do I don't know he made some justification video
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.760]   I feel bad for kevin. I love kevin as a person
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:29.560]   Oh, but I don't love nft's crypto and I do feel like this is this is the way of the world with this stuff
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:37.000]   You know, I still don't have a problem with nft's allow an artist to get paid my problem is to scam behind it all
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:42.920]   It feels like the whole thing is a house of card scam and I just uh, it's better
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:46.360]   You better off if look at if kevin could get scammed
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:51.000]   Anybody can get scammed. He's a sophisticated user
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.640]   The other thing too is you get gary vader chuck will make up you know in 30 seconds make up a
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:59.160]   A mouse and say this mouse is gonna be huge
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:02.120]   Not imagining
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:06.680]   The actual creativity that goes into building a character and building stories and building everything else
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:11.800]   I have a character is gonna be huge. It's kind of offensive to all creativity. I find a little offensive
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:17.160]   It's a little bit about stuff offended me. I never really got down with the board. Hey, well, it's it's
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:19.800]   How can we take somebody's
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:25.320]   Art and monetize it's folk the whole focus is well, how can we create a scarcity? Yeah?
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:30.040]   It's creating an artificial scarcity or it's
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:33.720]   to to hype up something that inherently
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:40.200]   Can't it that doesn't have value. Well, I won't say because you know, who's to say a board a it doesn't have value
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.600]   It has value to someone
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:45.320]   Yeah, but not at that level in
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:51.080]   Yeah, anyway, I think it's it's kind of the end of the copyright arc
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:56.600]   this whole notion of of creativity as as a property versus an act
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:01.640]   And that you can put a fence around it and make it into a tradable asset
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:06.840]   And so what the the end of key people say the web three people say is we're gonna be everybody's gonna own everything
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:09.160]   I think I think the world's going a different way
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:12.760]   And I think it's the last gasp of that worldview
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:16.040]   Uh
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.160]   Yeah
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:19.000]   I think we're yeah
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.840]   There's a lot wrong in the world today. That's all I can say. I say I feel like I know
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:26.600]   Uh, this is what happens when you get past a certain age you start saying hey
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:29.240]   The way it is is not the way it used to be and it's not good
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:36.600]   I'm sorry come on. I say that no reflection on kevin. I'm sorry that that happened to you. That's terrible. Yes
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.080]   Yeah
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:42.040]   But I think it's a cautionary tale for all of us
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:45.880]   So I hope that he's reveals how he
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:52.520]   Uh, was socially engineered. Yes to help us all to cut off that tactic
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:54.680]   Whoever's doing it
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:59.960]   Well, it may be just like truly good social engineering. So we just don't know. Yeah, like
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:03.320]   I'm sure we'll hear more more about it
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:05.960]   Um
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:08.920]   Team obel says for the second time hackers have stolen
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:15.160]   A bunch of data. They promised it wouldn't happen again, but you know how those things are 37 million customers
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:18.120]   Name address and account number they say
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:23.560]   And of course I trust them credit card data and networks weren't affected nor were passwords
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:29.640]   Um, they discovered the hack january 5th. We're able to trace the source and stop it within a day
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:35.720]   Well, but 37 million accounts were exfiltrated in 2021. The same thing happened
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:41.240]   Uh, they got personal information including social security numbers drivers license information of 13 million
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:44.680]   Active and 40 million perspective t mobile customers
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:50.840]   They settled a half billion dollar class action lawsuit and said, oh, we're gonna make sure that doesn't ever happen again
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:54.680]   Enough said
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:58.280]   No, I see a question. Yes on the story
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:00.360]   Uh
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:02.120]   line 87
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:04.120]   out of um
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:05.720]   Las vegas
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:10.280]   the active cooling chip to get rid of fans is this
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:13.000]   real
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000]   You see this oh, I saw this
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:18.760]   Um, let me look at it again because I haven't seen this
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:21.720]   Is this the the jet blowing thing?
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:26.360]   No, I don't think it takes any air. It just it just better just to to take the
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:29.560]   Um, seem like that's off the discord
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:33.160]   from someone
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:39.400]   What did you say it seems like I saw this in our discord from someone too. Yeah
[01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:43.240]   Yeah, I have been ignoring this story for a week
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:45.400]   Uh, but that's why I was right about jeff
[01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:49.240]   Well, I was having a gaming. Is it bs? Yeah?
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:52.760]   Okay, uh, I mean, maybe not. Yeah, who knows
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:57.960]   I just I would love to have no threat of fans of the future. That's why I'm asking
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.840]   Uh, I have to watch a video to see
[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:07.880]   Yeah, this is a story. All this crap. Okay. Nevermind. Nevermind. Okay. I have for a systems
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:11.960]   Asana's a california based company has been working on a project
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:15.640]   Oh, this is the air jet stuff filled a saw state. Oh, it is
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:22.920]   Paizo electric based cooling solution which works through the use of ultrasonic membranes that run across the surface of a heat spreader
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:27.080]   Pulsing out the heat from a process. Oh, that was supposed to replace my and quiet
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:32.200]   Nose thing too. That was supposed to replace there was supposed to be a little tiny thing. I put my nose that we get rid of my
[01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:33.400]   um
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:37.560]   I'll tell you in general that never happened. Yeah in general just you know
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:41.160]   My my way of doing this things when they make a product. I'll talk about it
[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:43.400]   Okay
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:49.400]   Oh, I I talk about things ahead of the making of product. Of course. I am a former chip reporter. So that's part of what I do
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:51.720]   um
[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:55.480]   Yeah, I haven't talked to these people. So I would have to look a lot of to me
[01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:58.920]   Having done this for 40 freaking years
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:02.040]   Uh, I note only half as long
[02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:06.120]   I note that there's always a lot of excitement about new technologies and people say
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:12.120]   It's gonna change the world. I'm gonna change everything and 90% of the time you never see another story about it
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:17.800]   For whatever reason. So my general rule is if when it's a product
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:23.240]   When they're actually, you know close to shi- maybe they're not shipping yet, but they're uh, they're in the
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:30.040]   Well, uh, uh, CES is full of stuff is never gonna ship too. So no when it's a product. I'll talk about it until then it's a novelty
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:34.760]   It's perhaps interesting. I've been bitten a few times. We talked a lot steve gifts
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:42.120]   And was so excited about super capacitive charging that was you know, and I actually have a screwdriver
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:44.840]   That works that way
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:47.240]   But it hasn't really done anything else so
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:50.600]   It's crude
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:54.840]   Screwdriver charges very fast and discharge is almost as fast
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:02.040]   So this company does have a hundred million dollars from intel and from qualcom
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:09.480]   Which again if you're going to invest in I mean there would be the people who'd invest in it doesn't so I think the technology
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:11.720]   Is viable?
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:13.960]   Will it become commercial?
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:19.560]   That's still to be the tbd Jeff. How's that? That's the answer I wanted to hear thank you. Stay say I wanted a context
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:23.480]   You know, not an old man whiny my my general
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:26.840]   My general point of view is okay
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:29.640]   We can only cover about 50 to 100 stories a week
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:34.920]   And most of these are never gonna become important. I just have an idle curious
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:44.280]   See this looks like it has to be built into the chip at some level not if not the CPU itself then this like module like
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:50.520]   So see the whole kit and kaboodle. It looks like a physical solution that is built on top of our into the thing
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:57.560]   Which means that it would be harder to implement because it would change the way these things are packaged and or manufactured
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:02.120]   This is what I wanted was Stacy's perspective. Thank you. That's exactly what I was curious to hear
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:09.160]   So so so that is that is what I will give you now based on the 30 seconds
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:12.120]   I have I have read
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:16.760]   I'm that sold. Sorry again. You don't have to we've now wasted five minutes
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:22.760]   Okay. All right. Oh, like you don't waste time. This is not why it's not an democracy. I carefully
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:26.360]   stories that we use
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:30.840]   I've been I was excited to use my expertise to help Jeff
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:38.440]   Glad you that part was great. Yeah, that part was great. But look watch this. I'm gonna type the last of
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:40.920]   us into google search
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:47.000]   Why could I figure out why this was oh there's a red mushroom? What do you think that means?
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.960]   Oh, no
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:50.920]   Oh
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:52.360]   Oh really?
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:56.360]   This is more exciting than a whole at least it's real technology
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:00.120]   It's real. It's just not commercial
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:03.240]   It is about google
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:08.200]   It's real. Yeah, it's happening right now on my desktop. Oh
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:15.720]   Okay, I don't I don't know. I think this has to be one. No, it has to do with some HBO show. I'm not watching
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:19.320]   It's the last of us. It's the call. How do you say call us up?
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:26.200]   It was it was it was the one that makes ants yeah takes over their brains and it was it's the base
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:28.440]   Look at all freaking zombies, right?
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:33.000]   Um, it's another zombie show was a game. It was a pretty good game. I like it was a game
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.240]   That's why people are interested is because they've turned a game into a tv show
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:41.560]   Again in my opinion another piece of evidence that the world's going to hell
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:44.360]   Uh, but you know, okay
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:49.240]   Uh, isn't is there not a William Faulkner short story you could use?
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:52.840]   Uh, no, I'm just kidding
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:58.920]   Hey, everybody leo report here. I am the founder and one of the hosts at the twit podcast
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:04.200]   Network i want to talk to you a little bit about what we do here at twit because I think it's unique
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:06.840]   and I think for anybody who is
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:12.040]   uh, bringing a product or a service to a tech audience
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:15.400]   You need to know about what we do here at twit
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:19.080]   We've built an amazing audience of engaged intelligent
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.480]   affluent listeners
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:30.440]   Who listened to us and trust us when we recommend a product our mission statement is twit is to build a highly engaged community of tech enthusiasts
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:37.000]   But already you should be your ears should be perking up at that because highly engaged is good for you
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:40.360]   Tech enthusiasts if that's who you're looking for. This is the place
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:45.960]   We do it by offering them the knowledge they need to understand and use technology in today's world

[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:02.680]   Uh 80 percent he said he was gonna fire 75
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:07.800]   He's fired 80 percent of employees headcount around 1300 and of that all
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:13.240]   About half little little more than half little less than half rather our full-time engineers
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:19.320]   So how's he making up the difference? He's brought in people from Tesla SpaceX and the boring company
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:23.880]   130 people share their companies say boy. I'd be pissed if I were it
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:29.080]   It's like one more like what were they not doing anything over there? Why don't you find them?
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:32.840]   Yeah, who's are they are they still being paid by Tesla? Yeah, what do you think?
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:39.960]   What do you think? Well, Twitter panel doesn't have an accounting apartment. So right? They ain't paying them
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:47.080]   Hey pan, uh, all right. Let's see. Let's see we did jack did two companies
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:50.440]   He had a pretty firm wall, right?
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:55.960]   Well people were pretty pissed that jack was kind of barely but in a time. Yeah, and twitter
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:58.600]   Uh, and uh, he wasn't using a staff
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:06.280]   That's why by the way twitter was available and and could be snagged by elon is that people were very unhappy with the way it was being run
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:10.120]   Uh and more than happy with the board and you know, it was just not a good
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:16.040]   Twitter's been I guess it's important to understand twitter's been in trouble long before elon came along
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:19.000]   Yes
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.200]   What who boy?
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:21.880]   Yeah, boy
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:24.680]   So, uh, the academy award nominations came out
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:27.480]   Uh on monday
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:34.280]   And there was one kind of big surprise where a number of snubs viola davis who probably should have been nominated
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:37.560]   She was snub. Do you you serious? Yeah
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:41.320]   You didn't you didn't hear about this?
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:43.080]   That's day
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:45.080]   Are you being facetious or real?
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:47.400]   No, i'm serious
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:51.480]   What was the goddess? What was the name of the woman king the woman king?
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:54.840]   And apparently it was an amazing performance, right?
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:57.480]   Yes, just um
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:01.160]   That sucks. Uh, yeah, hollywood sucks man
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:05.720]   So, well the reason there's a reason i bring it up because instead of
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:10.120]   A her getting a nomination a woman named andrea risbro
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:13.720]   Got a name nomination for a movie called too leslie
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:17.880]   That made 27 000 at the box office but
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:22.120]   Now normally the way this works in hollywood and you know this jeff is
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:24.120]   during this
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:26.920]   period of a few months between november and january, uh
[02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:32.680]   There are ads everywhere bill board's everywhere f yc for your consideration
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:40.360]   To the on the movie companies trying to gin up interest in their movies so they get nominated because that's that makes a difference in box office
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:42.120]   Uh
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:47.640]   This movie was so small and the company that made it was so small they obviously couldn't afford it, but somehow
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:50.760]   twitter put him over the top
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:57.880]   kate blanchette steven spielberg oprah winfrey maryll streep daniel day lewis martin score sazy
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:00.520]   all tweeted
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:04.600]   Saying andrea risbro's performance in too leslie was quote
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:09.800]   They all said this the greatest screen performance in the history of the cinematic medium end quote
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:16.760]   It worked she got a nomination for best actress beating out. You damn viola davis
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:18.760]   Wow
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:23.400]   Uh, it's so there's some question about what was going on here
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:29.000]   Uh, there was some kind of ground swell for maybe was maybe was organic
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:33.160]   For uh for this woman everybody says it was a great performance
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:39.000]   I brought up only because it shows what promotion twitter still has a lot of power
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.360]   Yeah, right. I have no problem with you using that that
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:45.800]   Platform for promotion purposes because it clearly works
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:54.840]   But i'm still a little pismus davis didn't get denied damn she was good in that every year there's uh, who the woman who was until was also uh snubbed
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:59.560]   I yeah, I don't forgot the name. Yeah, I can't either
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:04.280]   But every year this happens that there are some snubs. I haven't seen a movie in three years
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:10.760]   Actually, if if you look if you look at the nominees, I'm not impressed avatar
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:13.640]   Top gun
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:19.560]   Normally that was legit good though. It was a good movie, but not the kind of picture that normally gets nominated for best picture
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:26.680]   A germ a small german, uh anti war film. I guess a remake of the classic all quiet in the western front
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:29.800]   Got best picture nominee got a bunch of nominations
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:35.800]   Um, uh, so did oh, what was it called? Well everything
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:39.000]   ever were she oh the yeah, yeah, the
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:44.440]   Yeah, but the the number one nominee was uh, and I think justly was everything everywhere all at once
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:50.200]   Shell go and would it would an interesting different movie? I'm glad it got all the 11 nominations
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:54.120]   That could be like I got all of them. Um, that's a lot. Yeah, that's a lot
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:14:01.160]   Uh, risebrow is uh, the an addict trying to break free from her demons in michael morse's debut film
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:03.800]   She wins the lottery then burns through the money

[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:05.000]   Uh, hi everyone. I am this is kate winslet. Hi
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:11.560]   And I mean that's support. I maybe it must have been the greatest performance in all of all time for that
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:14.840]   Well, that's what i'm like. I'm like, these are not people who like yeah
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:18.200]   Like it's enough of a wide variety of people i'm like, well
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:26.040]   Shoot, maybe they do there was a little office. There was a little upset by all the Davis and danielle deadwiler is the other
[02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:31.240]   Actors from till who many thought were front runners for best actress
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:33.880]   Didn't get a nomination
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:38.200]   To the credit this doesn't sound cooked to me
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:42.920]   Yeah, it just sounds like people like you know when someone loves a book and they're like, oh my god
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:47.640]   You have to read it you give it to everybody it kind of sounds like that. Yeah, so I don't think you could
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:53.080]   I don't think there's enough money in the world to get you know jennifer aston courtney cox demi more jamey lekurtis brad
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:56.360]   We would feel all these people really you don't think so we got a guy
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:16:59.320]   I think there's enough money in the world but kate winslet on the other
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:03.480]   No, these people they're not gonna even for a they don't need a you know
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:09.560]   Here's five million dollars. Would you plug our friend? No, it ain't they must have all thought this was amazing, right?
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:12.600]   No, I agree. It doesn't sound cooked
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:15.720]   But it could be cooked but it just doesn't say it's a
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:23.080]   Fascinating but it does show and again, that's the only reason i bring it up that social media including very much twitter
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:30.920]   But also instagram and youtube and others can really have some power well within that small circle. I mean here i'm gonna argue
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:33.640]   um
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:35.560]   It's not any more
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:40.680]   The mass numbers it didn't make a difference with the public it made a difference with a very small circle of people
[02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:44.920]   It's just like jennifer's talking to each other. Right. This was their you know little echo chamber. Yeah
[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:50.120]   Yeah, but that leads to stories and things that get it to mass and that's all that matters
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:57.960]   We'll see how much more than $27,000 of as a making what's it called again because I got to make a note
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:01.880]   I'm trying to do better about watching atch for movies. Yeah, I'll watch this
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:04.760]   This is not a blockbuster by any means too lessly
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:09.400]   Um, here's Edward Norton's tweet. Let's check the uh
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:14.360]   What's the rotten tomatoes? Yeah, oh 98% well, that's pretty but you know what lately
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:17.240]   There's a lot of 98% that I might not agree with
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:24.120]   I will say though. I watch pattington because it had a perfect rotten tomatoes. Yeah, it was a great decision. Was it perfect?
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:27.320]   Paddington yes, it was a free movie
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:31.480]   I realized and this I realized this actually back with the zagat guides
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:34.440]   uh, which were uh
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:39.400]   Until google bottom and kind of destroyed it was a great little slim red
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.720]   Guidebook to restaurants that you could buy and it was very reliable
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:47.560]   Lisa and I used to do our own zagat. If we go to a restaurant was that a 27?
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:49.400]   Uh, there's more like a 23
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:55.240]   But it was usually pretty reliable, but then I realized it really depended because it was all done by the public on what public
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:19:00.200]   Right. So there's the gat restaurant guides in peoria, Illinois for instance
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:04.200]   We're less all of garden is a great place
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:08.760]   Well, the number the number one
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:17.240]   According to foodies food week in peoria, Illinois the number one appetizer was the salsa and chips at chipotle
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:19.880]   so
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:22.760]   That's why I used uh peoria in this case
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:27.240]   But but I realized that if if you're in san francisco for instance
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:33.000]   And in a restaurant's 27 that's a different thing than if you're in another city and it's a 27
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:38.520]   But yes, and I think it's the same with rotten tomatoes because it's selective the people who go see pad
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:42.520]   I would never see pattington, but i'm also probably the guy who gave it a 43
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:48.600]   Right, right. Oh no, no, it's really an engaging movie. I mean as long as you just
[02:19:48.600 --> 02:19:56.680]   I'm looking at the tomato score and the audience scores just as high as the the credit score for this too
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:20:03.240]   That says a lot too. I think we have to see we have to see very excuse. I see we've got a C2 Leslie and
[02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:05.880]   You now have to see patting
[02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:06.840]   Oh
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:12.440]   She may be doing stacey. Maybe what I have I have a rule ever since the kids got up past 13
[02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:18.040]   I don't see animated crap at all. It's not animated pattington is
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:22.440]   Okay, the bear. Okay fine the bear
[02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:26.040]   Sace Stacy saffside
[02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:28.520]   Yeah, we've discovered
[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:32.040]   romantic space really a real problem with pattington
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:49.600]   For me is the fact that when we showed pattington having tea with g
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:56.640]   Not aware of that but studio canal like full movie. I will never see 30. He'd be sued for calling them bastards
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:21:00.800]   No, wait a minute bastards is oh no bastards as a matter of fact, isn't it
[02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:03.920]   jerks I could say
[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:09.600]   You can you can you can't liable somebody with something that's an opinion only with a matter of fact if I if we're ever to say
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:15.040]   Studio canal those guys are extortionists. I could get in trouble because they're not
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:21.440]   Right, but if I say they're but a bastard has a literal meaning and that exactly so I'm realizing
[02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:26.720]   I can't call them bastards. I can only say they're bad bad people
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:30.480]   They are
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:34.080]   I have no I have no I actually I don't really go threats
[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:38.560]   Uh, it was pattington to should we see patting dinner patting to do
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:43.680]   No, you should see the first pattington. Okay pattington to was just yeah
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:49.920]   That was just a cheap attempt to capitalize on the joy exactly excellence of the original
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:54.480]   You know and I loved this book when I when when I kids were little I read the book to them. I loved it
[02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:59.200]   Andrew even liked the movie and he's kind of a cranky person like you
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:04.000]   He thought it was delightful as well. So
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:08.080]   Nice to you. He was hearing you Stacy. Did you ever think of that?
[02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:09.840]   No
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:10.640]   All right
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:15.840]   Jeff, I'm gonna let this be a democracy for one brief shining moment and give you a chance to pick some of these
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:18.480]   Jeff put more stories in here than I did
[02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:22.560]   This is very we're not surprised any of us. Yeah
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:26.640]   We've done a we've done a lot of them. We've done a lot of them
[02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:30.240]   A lot of actually this week at last week you did a lot of them. I was very happy
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:32.720]   Yeah, I didn't want to point it out for the fear that you'd notice
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:39.200]   In fact, I'm looking and I think I've done them almost all of them you've done a girl
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:44.560]   There's a weird story. You want a weird story? Yeah, the man is sued chick fillet. Yes, and I know
[02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:53.920]   It's a wacky story. He is a Virginia man is suing chick fillet in san francisco
[02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:57.200]   over sharing data with facebook
[02:22:57.200 --> 02:23:03.040]   He coming from a press that a law that was passed because of get to that part
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:12.160]   Fantastic a virginia man making the company the sixth to be sued in the last 35 days for alleged violations of an obscure federal statute
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:19.120]   Uh, this includes daven buster's lazy boy matel smucker's proctor and gamble
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:23.440]   Uh all six of the cases filed by the same guy kyth carol
[02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:28.400]   Who said each other fenancy legally shared his personally identifiable information with
[02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:33.200]   Facebook he wants $25 for each member of the six classes
[02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:36.240]   Uh, oh he wants me to be a class action. Okay
[02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:39.840]   This is the video privacy protection act
[02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:44.480]   of largely forgotten federal statute passed in 1988
[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:52.880]   In response to the public outing of the video cassette viewing records of supreme court nominee robert bork. Oh, isn't that fascinating?
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:57.680]   You may remember that actually is way back when that uh
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:02.400]   46 videotapes that bork rented bork by the way did not
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:11.520]   Ascent of the supreme court. He got borked. He was a reagan nominee. I think right or was it bush bush bork revealed nothing salacious
[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:14.000]   judge bork favored
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:17.360]   Alfred hitchcock films spy thrillers and british costume dramas
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:22.240]   bipartisan concern over the privacy issues resulted in the passage of
[02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:25.120]   The video privacy protection act
[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:30.320]   Which no one has paid any attention to because nobody rents movies from blockbuster anymore, right
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:33.360]   the statute says
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:42.320]   Any videotape service provider who knowingly discloses personally identifiable information concerning any customer
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:45.600]   uh
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:51.360]   Can be liable for up to for at least $2,500 plus punitive damages and tournies fees
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:57.680]   So the theory is defendants have shared information about their customers video viewing preferences
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:00.400]   with facebook
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:02.400]   Though the videos at issue are not
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:09.040]   Obviously the full-length movies you'd get at a blockbuster in the smucker's suit for instance the videos
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:11.600]   Are how to brew coffee?
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:15.520]   lazy boy said as a customer on video recounting her design story
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:20.800]   The kapleta ledges that chick fillet owns or controls a website at evergreenhills.com
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:27.200]   And whenever someone watches a video on the website defendant secretly reported all the details to facebook
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:30.480]   Sending them pii
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:33.040]   What's at evergreenhills.com?
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:36.320]   Yes, well, oh, it's a chick fillet
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:38.960]   Click on so it evergreen
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:43.280]   Wait a minute. We are investigating suspicious activity on some customer accounts
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:45.440]   Sure enough
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:49.280]   So you're barely admitted to protect there's a chick fillet breach
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:56.000]   So where's the videos if I watch a video on here? Oh, here it is. I'm gonna watch a video of a guy in a cow suit
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:02.240]   I hate these ads by the way these chick fillets. They're just terrible. I should normally know about this company
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:03.120]   Yeah
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:08.320]   Oh, the chick fillets so nice that when customers come in our poor underpaid employees
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:12.640]   Give them stuff. We try to pay in food. Right not money. Yeah
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:18.720]   So I would just watch that video and now chick fillet is sending that information to facebook according to this guy
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:21.440]   because
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:24.800]   Because of a like button or something or a pixel
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:31.040]   So let's see here. This is using a tool the facebook calls the facebook tracking pixel
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:34.480]   Once the tracking pixel is embedded and activated
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:39.440]   By the way, people are always asking us always advertisers say
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:41.760]   Uh, can you embed a tracking pixel?
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:44.080]   No
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:47.520]   You can't it's a podcast you cannot put a tracking pixel on a podcast
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:49.840]   Right, no
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:56.480]   Uh, we do not do that but apparently sites do it reports the data to facebook about the advertisers customers on the site visio
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:27:03.600]   Oh, yeah, so this is trying to do the same thing. We do try to do where they're matching people who saw a facebook
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:07.280]   ad for chick fillet with people who ended up on the chick fillet site
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:11.040]   And then facebook says see your ads work
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:15.120]   Right because we own half of the internet we can tell you that right?
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:18.800]   So it's and so the way we handle that and I hope I'm trusting it's going to work
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:23.840]   We use it a company that was bought by spotify so god knows but the idea is
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:27.360]   Uh, it's called pod sites. A lot of podcasters use this
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:31.600]   Pod sites gets the IP addresses of all the downloads from us
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:35.680]   They store those and keep them private and all that stuff and then they get
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:42.160]   They do put a tracking pixel on the advertiser's site and that tracking pixel sends them a list of IP addresses again
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:47.840]   Which they promise to keep private they do a match and they they all they say to the advertiser is
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:52.240]   30% of the people saw your ad on twit ended up on your website or whatever
[02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:57.280]   They don't give any information to either party. We don't get the information about the tracking pixel
[02:27:57.280 --> 02:28:00.000]   The advertiser doesn't get information about downloads
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:06.000]   And pod sites as an independent third party just gives them the one thing they really care about is did the ad work
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:11.280]   So we try we do so i bet you that's what's going on here is that same kind of thing. Yeah
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:13.760]   um
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:18.080]   Don't sue us because we really try hard we very very careful not to give up any
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:20.000]   I asked them again and again
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.080]   I we went over this again and again
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:26.000]   And they have covenants and agreements and contracts to say yeah, no, no that information stays
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.400]   This is somebody who just clearly wants to go after facebook
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:31.200]   At the internet
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:38.960]   No, we leave this flows information that is sufficient to permit an ordinary person to identify a specific individuals video viewing behavior
[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:42.160]   Interestingly facebook is not named it's the
[02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:45.200]   advertisers that's named
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:48.080]   but still
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:50.640]   That's the way to attack part of facebook's business. I think
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:55.360]   In order to have standing just you in federal court a plaintiff must have a concrete injury
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:58.240]   from the defendant's conduct
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:04.240]   So we'll see if he has standing even I don't know this will be interesting. We'll watch that
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:07.200]   We'll keep an eye on that story. Yeah, I put that in there
[02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:11.440]   Uh, all right other advantages. I didn't read the whole story
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:14.720]   You read the whole story and explained it to me a splina service
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:18.240]   You should just have the splain to me section leo splains this
[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:25.520]   Are you are you stacey stacey is splains piezo electric current? What is piezo electric?
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:27.120]   current
[02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:28.160]   uh
[02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:33.360]   Well piezo means to move or it piezos move and
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:39.520]   I use them in energy harvesting. So anything that's powered by pie pie azos
[02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:42.960]   Is harvesting energy from the difference in movement?
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:44.880]   so
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:49.200]   Uh, oh piezo is the american pronunciation. So it's like piezo
[02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:53.760]   So I know I get it in my my world. This is what happens when I wear quarter rate pants
[02:29:53.760 --> 02:29:55.760]   the
[02:29:55.760 --> 02:30:00.800]   The rubbing together of my thighs generates electricity in the corduroy
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:08.320]   If I happen to have a piezo electric device to capture that days is not happy
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:17.440]   Okay, here we go the the piezo electric effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress
[02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:22.160]   Yeah, that's actually what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. All right
[02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:26.400]   All right. All right. All right. Let's go back again to websters
[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:31.200]   I don't know. Oh, I got term. I said work though. I got term asanda
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000]   Yeah
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:38.720]   Pa. Oh, yeah, it's generating pa so electric
[02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:42.080]   Pa so electrically
[02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:45.280]   So it is pazo pa so electric
[02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:49.280]   Not pazo pa so there's two syllables interesting
[02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:51.360]   Something
[02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:56.800]   You were right in the first place. Yeah, I think I may have said pie azo. I said oh I see oh
[02:30:56.880 --> 02:31:02.800]   Was honest a good so what's the story with minichug regional high school and why did you put this story in the rundown Jeff?
[02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:06.160]   You explained to me. It's time for that. I thought it was a stacy story too
[02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:11.200]   Because it's what happens when internet of things goes completely bad
[02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:16.160]   For a year and a half of massages his high school has been lit up around the clock
[02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:20.800]   Because they can't turn off the lights. Oh, no
[02:31:20.800 --> 02:31:26.240]   It turns out the jokes are resonated. That's why it turns out the uh
[02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:31.920]   the uh the software the software that turns off the lights has failed
[02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:34.000]   and
[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:38.080]   And apparently there's no switch better with it all than off. Yeah. Well, that's true
[02:31:38.080 --> 02:31:41.120]   um
[02:31:41.120 --> 02:31:45.760]   It uses highly efficient fluorescent and led bulbs
[02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:50.080]   When possible teachers have manually removed bulbs from fixtures
[02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:54.160]   While staffers have shut off breakers not connected the main system
[02:31:54.880 --> 02:31:56.880]   but in you know
[02:31:56.880 --> 02:32:00.800]   It communicates an image of profligacy
[02:32:00.800 --> 02:32:09.120]   Uh boy and besides when you drive by the high school in the middle of the night and it's blazing bright
[02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:10.880]   You got to wonder what's going on in there
[02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:16.160]   There's hope on the horizon that lights at minichug will soon be dimmed
[02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:21.440]   Paul must own the president of the reflex lighting group said
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:27.120]   The parts we need to replace the system at the school have finally arrived from the factory in jiner
[02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:30.640]   And we expect to do the installation over the february break
[02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:36.640]   And this time there will be a remote override switch so this won't happen again
[02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:40.160]   And we'll make more money from this
[02:32:40.160 --> 02:32:46.320]   Another story that I wasn't going to do but jeff
[02:32:46.320 --> 02:32:48.000]   jeff you're right
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:52.240]   It's for your is for your option. All right. I put it in there. It's gone on to
[02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:54.800]   Oh, it's got on to it's got on to it's exposure. What?
[02:32:54.800 --> 02:32:59.680]   I gave someone a wrong information that do not pay robot lawyer apparently
[02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:05.200]   Is not they're postponing their actual court case because the state bar said no
[02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:10.320]   Yeah, judges are notorious about not liking this kind of oh, yeah
[02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:15.760]   Uh, yeah, it was kind of it was going to represent
[02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:21.360]   A client in court probably not on some big issue, you know some sort of small
[02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:22.400]   Yeah
[02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:27.920]   Thing but uh josho bradder who fatted do not pay says after threats from the state bar
[02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:30.640]   I'm declined
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:32.720]   To do this so
[02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:38.000]   All right, well postponing our court case. We did this when he started that company. We covered up the show. Oh, yeah
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:45.200]   Yeah, you know, he's he actually did quite well, right? They for a long time. That was like uh parking tickets, right?
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:47.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:51.280]   Uh, let's do a quick google change login and wrap this thing up because Stacy's so
[02:33:51.280 --> 02:34:00.000]   I think i'm just getting sick. I think that's my issue
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.240]   No
[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:06.800]   Google clock 7.4 updates timer ui and test buttons for ending alarms
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:10.480]   This just in the change log this week
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:17.200]   Yeah, android 13 qpr beta 2 1 rolling out with blue 2 and 5g fixes for pixel
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:21.360]   Google meet is making it easier to share files during calls
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:26.480]   And ways now supports android auto's cool walk dashboard
[02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:29.360]   Do you actually you want to see what it looks like?
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:32.880]   Yeah, that's the cool walk dashboard
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:35.440]   Why is it called who walking driving?
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:38.720]   This is the redesign of android auto actually i'm gonna try this because I have
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:42.320]   I'm gonna try it tonight. I'm I must i have android on all my musta
[02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:45.760]   Cool walk is just the name of the dashboard
[02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:52.000]   You get you get uh panels so you can see what music you're listening to while you're looking at the map and stuff like that
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.640]   Why is it called cool walk?
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:35:00.080]   That's its name, jeff
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:02.240]   Explain it to me leo
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:07.280]   They paid a very expensive branding company millions of dollars
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:11.040]   To test with consumers a variety of names
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:16.480]   Including the new map, but you're driving you're not walking you're driving
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:19.760]   It's true
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:22.880]   I don't know. I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:26.720]   But that's what they're calling it and that's the google change log
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:33.520]   Scooter x had nothing this week then he was he was baron. Oh wait a minute. He found one thing
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:36.080]   uh
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:40.800]   Nest hub's new security page makes it hard access live camera feeds
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:44.480]   Oh, yeah, we've talked about that on our show
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:47.680]   Is it a big deal?
[02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:50.640]   No, no, it is not and I won't stop the
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:55.040]   Forward motion of this show. I just want to remind everybody of two important
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:59.360]   Details first take the survey last chance. I'm not going to mention it again
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:05.200]   Uh, it runs through the end of the month, which means we're just about six days off from the final
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:11.920]   Chance that the survey helps us so we don't have to track you so we don't have to put tracking pixels in your podcast
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:18.320]   It's just the advertisers want in a little bit about you know the general audience male female education that kind of thing
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:22.000]   Answer a few questions. It's completely optional. We appreciate it if you do
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:25.520]   Twit.tv/survey23. We also use it
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:30.560]   To you know kind of learn more about you and make sure we're on the right track with the programming and so forth
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:36.800]   So it's it's really the once a year thing we do to kind of get to know you twit.tv/survey23
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:43.360]   Thank you in advance also a plug which I am told I should do more often and I really want to to join our club
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:48.480]   It is a very important way for us to monetize. We only had one ad on this show
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:55.520]   Uh, it means, you know generally one ad doesn't cover the costs of doing the show. Let's put it that way
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:37:00.880]   Uh, but how do we support this show? Thanks to you your generous club twit member
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:07.840]   What do you get ad-free versions of all the shows you get access to the club twit discord, which is a great community
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:09.680]   of really
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:11.680]   fun people we have lots of time
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:15.280]   Uh talking in there in fact I go in there not only during the shows but
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:18.320]   during the regular week because
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:26.880]   We talk about everything I go in the coding section a lot anime autos beer book club gaming hacking ham radio pets
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:34.480]   Software travel and more gifts and memes to make you happy all day long. It is it is the key to memeing
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:39.280]   Jason's getting involved
[02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:45.280]   Uh all you have to do is give us $7 a month. That's nothing
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:52.320]   You also get uh special events that we don't put out in public special shows that we don't make available public like hands on windows
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:53.600]   hands on mac
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:59.760]   Uh our untitled linux show the gizfiz we've got some events coming up wind to dow host of all about android february 9th
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:02.320]   We're gonna do that daniel sware's
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:06.480]   Interview for triangulation and ask the tech guys on february 10th
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:08.080]   11 a.m
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:12.400]   But club members will get to ask daniel questions directly. He's looking forward to that. I can't wait
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:15.120]   Sam will sam edel join us march second
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:19.120]   Lisa and I did an inside twit which is available on the twit plus feed
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:22.640]   There goes martin sergeant trying to catch us
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:25.440]   a bicycle
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:27.680]   That's a good one. Where'd you find that Patrick?
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:34.240]   Anyway, it isn't much we could I think we could and should charge a lot more but lisa's really good about saying no
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:39.680]   Seven bucks. That's fine. That's all we need if we could get right now. It's about
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:42.720]   I think it's about two percent of the total
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:47.120]   There's uh if we were we have about 700 000 unique listeners every month
[02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:52.240]   If we could get 5 35 000 members, we only have 6 000 now gets a 5
[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:56.960]   It would make such a difference. It our financial future would be assured
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:02.080]   The lights would stay on everybody'd stay employed. We'd have to do layoffs and we could launch new shows
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:05.440]   That's all we ask if we got to 10 percent. We wouldn't even have to do ads anymore
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:09.200]   I mean it's that that's a huge difference. So huh
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:14.480]   We wouldn't even have to do shows if we had 10 percent we'd all just go home and let give us money for nothing
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:17.200]   so
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:19.840]   This is john's dream. I'm jammer be
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:23.520]   Dear toys
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:26.000]   uh to it dot tv slash club trip. I'm in all seriousness

[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:35.440]   Now it's time for our
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:40.240]   Pics of the week will start with stacy if you have a thing i'd like to know
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:44.640]   I do have a thing but I thought I brought it in
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:46.880]   I didn't um
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:51.520]   I don't get it. Tell you about it. Tell us about it. I'll pull up a website if you give if you give me the
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:57.920]   It's the chobra 85 t over the ear bluetooth and wired headphones because you
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:39:59.520]   I'll do it on your head. Oh
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:02.000]   wired
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.400]   J is chobber still around i'm kind of amazed
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:07.440]   They've started doing that you know aids. I think right
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:10.880]   They have oh, you know what and this is another thing
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:12.720]   I'll just throw this out here because
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:16.320]   Kevin did a review this morning on the apple two earbuds
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:21.840]   Yeah, uh, pro. Yeah, uh, air pods pro two air pods pro two. Yes
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:25.600]   Which I have and I like a lot. They're very good
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:29.840]   He uses them as hearing aids and he says they're better than the new hearers
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:34.800]   Yeah, because apple has a feature uh where you can use your phone as a microphone
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:37.600]   And it goes in the earbuds you get ambient sound and stuff
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:41.920]   And so if you were at a dinner or something you put the phone in the middle and you yeah
[02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:44.480]   You hear quite well. It's quite good and they're comfortable
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:47.920]   It's he actually doesn't he doesn't use it that way. Oh, okay
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:51.840]   He doesn't do that what he did is he uploaded his audiographic
[02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:57.200]   Profile from a site called me me and he then went into the accessibility panel
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:59.920]   and he now like
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:04.160]   Custom tuned his headphones to his hearing. Oh, I'm gonna have to do this
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:10.400]   Yeah, go check out. Okay. So this will be my thing because it's actually I had it's on the podcast this week
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:14.800]   It's on stacey on iot the air pods pro two second gin
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:19.680]   As smart herables puts a smile on my face. Oh really cool
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:24.960]   Oh, i'm gonna. Okay, so I have the air pods too. I'm gonna have to try they have noise cancellation
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:28.640]   They also have the ability to mix ambient sound into the audio
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:34.320]   Uh, why is my font so ugly on your computer because i'm in linux
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:36.720]   Would you like it? Oh
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:40.560]   Would font would you like it? No, I just i'm like god. That's hideous. What font you
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:43.840]   Looks fine to me. What font would you like it to be?
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:49.760]   What's this supposed to be? I tell Andrew to use a website font if he's using a
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:53.520]   A font or not using a downloadable font. Yeah, i'm not gonna see it
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:57.360]   I'm using firefox on manjaro linux you could tell him that
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:03.280]   And it's just a plain old sancera if it looks like helvetica or something. Yeah, well ours is yeah
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:08.320]   It's probably no it's hideous god. Whatever I see you pull up my website. I'm like cringing really
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:11.920]   It's actually a little bolder. I that's I kind of like it better
[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:16.320]   Oh, maybe it that it is bolder. It's just ugly
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:22.960]   You don't know off the ask Andrew what font you use and i'll just make sure that that's the fun i use from now on
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:26.960]   Um, I mean i haven't installed if i install it it would then
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:31.200]   Do it probably here. I'll later i'll look in the developer
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:37.520]   Tools, okay. Well, I switched my thing apparently to kevin's kevin's review of the herables because we got sidetracked
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:39.600]   But yes, the other thing is the jabra
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:41.440]   85
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:48.080]   I'm just make it hold on. I got to tell you but it is really i'm looking at your uh site on uh on uh john's macbook
[02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:51.200]   Oh, yeah, that's nice. It's very thin
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:54.480]   Yeah, it is. I like mine better
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:57.440]   Okay, well there you go roll Stacy
[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:04.640]   Oh the jabbera, these are old the 85 t's i have these actually yeah, they're great. Yeah
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:10.880]   I just like I bought them. They're not new or anything like that, but not expensive 140 bucks
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:15.200]   They were even cheaper than that. I think no nice, but yeah
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:20.800]   They were like a hundred bucks. Oh wow. Well, one of them is an earbud. What was it? I was a headset
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:22.880]   What are you what are you pumping here?
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:24.880]   But basically well
[02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:31.360]   My husband is in this little tiff because I wander around listening to audiobooks when i'm doing things and he can't tell because this is
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:33.840]   Inside your ears. Yeah, so he gets so
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:40.160]   Pissy i might just like oh you talk about the age of age you stacy no comment. I'm talking about the 85 h
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:43.680]   Uh, I had the t. Yes. Okay. The age. Yeah
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:46.640]   Um interesting
[02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:51.360]   So so now this is a visible indicator that I am listening to my audio
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:55.760]   But I mean like i'm like look if I am running around the house doing laundry and like washing dishes
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:59.840]   You can just walk next to me and at least it does exactly the same thing
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:02.640]   And i'm talking to her
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:05.120]   And she doesn't know i'm talking
[02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:08.480]   And i think she's ignoring me, but no she's listening to a book
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:14.960]   I probably do it to her too. So these are read over the ear headphones that sound great probably
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:21.760]   Have better life amazing and I customize mine. I these are jobbers as well
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:27.040]   So I customize mine and to my hearing probe like my preferences rather
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:29.840]   That is the killing
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:35.600]   So android devices usually have that built in with within their sound settings, but uh
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:41.200]   He goes to me me to do this. Do you customize them with me or do you use a
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:46.960]   Job oh no, that's okay. So I use the job or app you can't I don't think I can bring in me
[02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:50.240]   Me me stuff. So yeah, these are two separate things that i'm apparently telling you
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:53.760]   No, but I didn't know about me. So this is a new but yeah new thing to me
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:59.760]   I use me to test my hearing too. It's I mean, it's free. So m I am I it's a what's an app
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:06.560]   Okay, yeah, it's just an app nice little hearing out. I used this long time ago. I remember this now
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:09.440]   Yeah, it's just like the audiologist test
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:15.040]   Yeah, you know that makes sounds in your left ear and your right ear and if if you can hear it. Yeah, okay
[02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:20.640]   You should do it with the with the device that you're using but I didn't know that it up it could upload the
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:29.120]   The profile to the profile. So that's that's what I thought was really cool is he could send he sends his audiogram to the iphone
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:34.720]   He hit the accessibility sitting settings and then there's a whole section that lets you
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:42.240]   Tune the sound to your audiogram or you can choose sounds nice. I'm gonna do this. That's great. So go check that out
[02:45:42.240 --> 02:45:47.840]   Yeah, and you all should check out the jobra 85 h
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:55.200]   Elites noise cancel. Are they noise canceling beach? Yeah, they're noise canceling. Um, I like the white ones
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:57.520]   I would get the white one those look pretty
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:05.600]   I got the titanium ones because they were 50 bucks less. Oh, because I'm cheap minor black and silver there. That's mine. Yeah. Yeah
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:08.240]   Because they were I think they were 150
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:11.440]   Nice
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:14.000]   Yeah, these are list for 250
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:19.360]   Nice. I think about mine for 150. I mean again. I'm I've got some
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:25.360]   Devices that are not that but I can't think it's so cool that you care so much about Andrew
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:31.840]   Thinking you're not paying attention to him that you wear these just so he will he just gets so crinky. He's just
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:37.680]   Just a little bit as irritable. I know I please say it's what I'm irritable to I understand
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:46.880]   Yeah, and uh and also go to stacey on iot.com and read this article about uh turning your air pod pro 2
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:51.680]   Into headfire herables nice hearing aids
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:55.280]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis number of the way
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:47:00.240]   Can I ask you a question first real quick? You have a pixel seven right right in front of me right here. Yes, sir
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:02.400]   Did you have you turned on clear calling?
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:08.720]   No, we were going to talk about this and i'm curious. Yeah, you had it in the list i'm curious because that might even make me buy one
[02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:13.360]   All right, i'll turn it on next week. I'll give you a report. But here's my thing
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:15.520]   Yeah, I a couple of things real quick
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:22.160]   So if you go to so so you see my office here 10 out of 10 beautiful i'm rate my skype room. It's well done
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:24.160]   Well, I have kind of a
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:31.040]   vaulted ceiling here. Yeah, which leads to i'm bringing in the carpenters next week. No don't do this. Jeff
[02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:34.480]   I'm doing it. I just can't wait don't do this Jeff
[02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:38.260]   Don't do it. Look what he wants to do. This is a story. It's out
[02:47:38.260 --> 02:47:44.400]   This uh mountain
[02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:46.080]   building engineer
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:47.600]   had a
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:54.560]   Collection of 70 hours in books likely the largest private collection in all of germany in a single family home and for those of you who are on audio
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:48:01.920]   He built um shell in a vaulted ceiling. It is completely filled with books
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:07.040]   There's there's there's wood slats to hold the bin and they are um
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:10.240]   obsessively sized
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:13.600]   And covers the entire ceiling every wall
[02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:17.200]   Plus one bookshelf 70,000 books in one house
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:20.560]   So i'm gonna guess he never
[02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:23.280]   Looks at the books in the ceiling. I
[02:48:23.280 --> 02:48:26.160]   Mean what does he have to do to get to that book? I don't know
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:32.240]   It's pretty well locked in and he doesn't live in earthquake country like we do
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:34.480]   because that
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:36.480]   That is a recipe for death
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:38.320]   problematic
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:40.320]   problematic that's the word
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:46.400]   I'm scared of my books my normal bookshelf right you know you don't have on the fixed with the little thing
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:48.400]   You guys strap him to the wall and everything yeah
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:51.120]   Uh, I can't remember if we did that or not
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:55.680]   There's always strapped in there's something in the host office there
[02:48:55.680 --> 02:48:58.320]   Um like a shelf and I remember mr
[02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:03.600]   Burke when I first got here going in and doing some type of reinforcement on that thing and i'm like i'm gonna
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:08.640]   As you do for kids too. Yeah, i'm gonna have to get uh berg to come to our house and do this
[02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:15.920]   LG recalls LG recalled 52,000 86 inch TVs because they fall over
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:22.320]   Whoops, uh
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:27.520]   So, you know you gotta pay attention that stuff we have our our hot water heater strapped
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:31.360]   Stuff like that in earthquake country. Yeah, you got to attach stuff to the wall
[02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:33.440]   So it also if you little kids
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:37.200]   You know the rest are over. Yeah, yeah, they pull them onto themselves
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:42.080]   This would be i'm gonna bump on my head from pulling a chair over onto my head when I was oh
[02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:45.280]   This oh
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:50.320]   That could explain a lot actually. Yeah, that's that's that's a joke. My family makes quite a bit
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:59.440]   This would you don't have to worry about toddlers pulling books off the ceiling. No, but I don't know how you get books off
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:06.000]   It's every inch right that's just amazing. I just like can you imagine the sound the sound quality in there must be great must be so dead
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:12.240]   That's yeah, that's the i was gonna say can you imagine the dust and the what if like little wormy's get in there?
[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:16.480]   Yeah, what word was literally well, he's german. He probably doesn't have any of those
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:21.600]   All right, that's uh jeff's pick of the week mr. Ant put
[02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:24.080]   your turn
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:30.480]   My pick I wanted to talk about this on my show, but then I did a bit of a I guess you can see
[02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:32.960]   unofficial survey and figured
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:39.280]   Probably wouldn't fit for my my particular audience, but maybe did this we can google audience with because there's more well see
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:45.120]   Yeah, oh look at that. Look at that. That just looks good. I like how that looks. What is this?
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:51.360]   Stella pro reflex s light. Uh, this is a constant light
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:59.360]   Um, but you can also use it as a strobe and have it connect to your camera to to be a flash instead of just a constant light
[02:50:59.360 --> 02:51:05.040]   The beauty of it that I enjoy is the fact that I can take this standard trigger here
[02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:11.600]   This is just an old go dots triggered that I could put on my camera cost maybe $60 with this
[02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:14.320]   And it will fire
[02:51:14.320 --> 02:51:17.600]   This this reflex s off and if I want to shoot
[02:51:18.320 --> 02:51:23.200]   10 frames a second it will do it click click click click you know really really fast
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:27.280]   Um instead of having to do what they call high speed sync
[02:51:27.280 --> 02:51:34.560]   Because only certain flashes allow you to have high speed sync where you can shoot at a certain shutter speed and be able to get the
[02:51:34.560 --> 02:51:39.360]   Maximum amount of power out of your strobe. All of this is just sort of built in you don't even have to think about it
[02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:43.360]   Just set it up either with blue with the bluetooth connection or use the
[02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:46.960]   Transmitter in such a channels and things like that
[02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:52.240]   It's super diagram cool, but yes, this is a little bit pricey for most people to listen to my show
[02:51:52.240 --> 02:51:55.200]   But this thing is pretty freaking badass
[02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:57.680]   About a hundred watts
[02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:02.640]   Our loaded is that is that the thinking that's pretty much what I said? Yeah
[02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:05.440]   All joined the club as a result
[02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:08.640]   Because of scooter act she's
[02:52:08.640 --> 02:52:12.320]   Right
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:16.400]   But it's bright. I mean again if you want to use it as a constant light you can use it for a video
[02:52:16.400 --> 02:52:22.240]   I said so hundred hundred watts in power if I wanted to use this for the show I could and it'll be a nice key light
[02:52:22.240 --> 02:52:24.640]   There's two reasons I like this
[02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:28.800]   It's the old school remember the photographers they put the hood over their head and they'd hold up
[02:52:28.800 --> 02:52:33.760]   Gunpowder strobe and they'd go watch the birdie
[02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:40.000]   You could do that you could what does this only weighs about a pound and a half two pounds max
[02:52:40.560 --> 02:52:42.560]   But other than that watch the bird
[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:45.920]   But then the other and of course off-camera flash is always better than on camera flash
[02:52:45.920 --> 02:52:47.920]   Oh camera is always better
[02:52:47.920 --> 02:52:50.080]   So even arms lengths would be better, right?
[02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:51.040]   Yep
[02:52:51.040 --> 02:52:53.040]   And this allows you to
[02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:57.120]   Connect like a bowens mount on the front of it because this is just an led light
[02:52:57.120 --> 02:53:02.640]   But it's modular and you can put a bowens mount on the front of it is powered by USB C
[02:53:02.640 --> 02:53:06.800]   So you can charge it up with USB oh neat USB C how long does it last or plug it in
[02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:11.360]   If you want to go full power constant light it's like six thousand lumens
[02:53:11.360 --> 02:53:16.880]   I believe wow stay on for half an hour, but you don't need that's not you don't need that much light
[02:53:16.880 --> 02:53:19.600]   Just turn it down in my imagination
[02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:27.600]   Hours, so was there like a jimmy stewart movie where earnest borgonines the bad guy and is trying to stab him and jimmy keeps flashing his
[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:31.600]   His strobe at him and he goes ah and he came oh man, I'd kill you
[02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:35.440]   Is that is that something I just you know dream?
[02:53:35.440 --> 02:53:39.360]   Do you're right right it was I feel like I don't know what the movie. I don't know the movie
[02:53:39.360 --> 02:53:41.440]   But it was too young to remember yeah
[02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:44.320]   I mean more old timers around here
[02:53:44.320 --> 02:53:48.560]   Oh, well, it was it was no. Yeah, I know it was it was um, uh,
[02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:52.560]   For rear window. It wasn't rear window. Yeah, he was a photographer rear window
[02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:54.560]   And he was in a big hip cast talking about
[02:53:54.560 --> 02:54:00.880]   Who is the bad guy? Oh, it's a oh aunt. Oh, it's a good movie. You really should watch it
[02:54:00.880 --> 02:54:05.440]   Oh aunt. It's about a photographer who is oh, you'd love it. He broke his leg
[02:54:05.440 --> 02:54:11.120]   He's got the best girlfriend ever. She was the princess of monoco grace kelly
[02:54:11.120 --> 02:54:14.000]   and uh, and uh
[02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:17.600]   He that's not part of the plot. No, no, but I it's it's
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:22.320]   It's she's really like he might be confused. She's she's really cute
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:28.240]   And uh, and uh, there's a cute scene at the beginning where she takes her jammies out of her purse
[02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:30.720]   But that's another thing that's stuck in my mind
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:33.520]   But it's really a bad
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:36.560]   It's really about a photographer who is kind of confined to his
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:40.400]   Apartment and he looks out the back window and he thinks he's seen a murder
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:47.520]   And don't get the one with christopher. Uh, that's not it. No, there was get the 1954
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:54.080]   Classic rear window rear window. Oh my god. Was this a great movie? I can't believe I'm jealous
[02:54:54.160 --> 02:55:00.480]   You haven't seen it, especially as a photographer. What should I get in 1954? Yeah, that's probably why it's an old movie
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:06.080]   But what a great movie it is and yeah, there is a scene isn't there is that is that correct?
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:09.760]   Yeah, it's at the uh, why don't raman burr raman burr was the bad guy
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:15.600]   He was the guy who he jimmy steward thinks committed murder kelly the alma ritter
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:18.720]   Yeah raman burr. Oh such a good movie
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:21.920]   And I love jimmy's i'll add that to the queue as well
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:26.160]   Do you watch old movie on ryan tene? Do you see old movies ever?
[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:28.080]   No, sir
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:32.240]   But again, i'm going to do my best to try to watch more more movies this year
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:36.400]   This would be a good one because the hero's a photographer war photographer
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:40.160]   Body double is the same idea. It is the same idea
[02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:45.280]   Uh, and a great movie in its own right, but I think rear window is the classic
[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:51.200]   And just because I think you like it because of the way the sets are constructed, you know, because you know, it's a
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:53.840]   Hollywood movie. It's not film bomb location
[02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:58.800]   Of course. So yeah, so it's very it's interesting. I think you will enjoy it
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:04.800]   And then watch for watch for the moment when he uh when he blinds raman burr with his strobe
[02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:07.520]   Which you could do with your reflex
[02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:12.480]   Yes, the reflex s now on sale for 767, but it's all
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:17.440]   Got a got a budget now. Oh, you're making my stuff look cheap. I like it
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:21.920]   You're pretty well equipped over there ant you got some
[02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:26.560]   I got a lot of gear. I do so yeah, I never shy away from a gig
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:34.640]   Do you do uh do you do weddings or uh things like that or i'm sticking i'm staying away from weddings because I don't want that pressure
[02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:41.360]   I'll just yeah, most people are crazy. I don't blame it. Yeah one person's one shot and yeah get any do over
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:47.440]   So I don't want that but I am uh going to pitch someone for some event stuff here. I got a feeler out
[02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:54.000]   here locally so lisa and my our our wedding anniversary is coming up on sunday
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:58.720]   And uh, yeah, and you have hair and I have hair this time
[02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:05.440]   And uh, I was thinking about this because I had shaved my head for an
[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:07.680]   For to raise money
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:14.960]   There wasn't a bet raise money for unisef and we did else have a tattoo i'm not proud of but that's another story
[02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:17.120]   uh
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:22.000]   but uh the sad thing to me is so we got married seven years ago in um
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:26.720]   A beautiful place in nappa that has since burned to the ground. It's gone
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:28.640]   Oh no
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:32.080]   I was thinking about the wedding photographer. He was wonderful. We had a great wedding photographer
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:35.440]   But all we have is a picture is that place is is ash
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:42.560]   That's the place you were also going to before the fire this don't come we got there
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:45.360]   Uh, it was smoky
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:49.920]   We started check in they said, you know, oh, yeah, I remember that two years. We might have to evacuate
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:56.640]   They did not can't they did not cancel our reservation, but thank god the desk clerk went, you know
[02:57:56.640 --> 02:58:03.200]   We think we might have to get evacuate. I probably wouldn't check in as we're driving back down the long road to it
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:06.320]   We get a text message saying go home. We're closed
[02:58:06.320 --> 02:58:12.640]   So we we got out of there, but that it did not get burned down that time it got burned down in a second
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:19.360]   Oh wow fire a couple years later. That's not you not there. It's god says california should be lived in a shaded
[02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:22.320]   We should not be here a bandon ca
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:29.360]   I like it here. I do too. I think you can your whole family move out from no no no humidity here man
[02:58:29.360 --> 02:58:32.080]   That's what i'm talking to climate here is superb
[02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:36.400]   And when it's cold it's superb even when it's pouring rain it's superb
[02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:41.200]   Even dare I say when there's an earthquake and you're sealing full of books hits you in the head
[02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:48.640]   It's super bamp, but it's not superb. You got to go over a bridge that might collapse because it's only in fair condition
[02:58:48.640 --> 02:58:52.640]   That's a good point fair condition. That's a good point
[02:58:52.640 --> 02:58:57.360]   mr. amp pro at hands-off photography twit.tv/hop what's coming up next

[03:01:31.120 --> 03:01:35.760]   No, no, you have to wear white socks. No black socks allowed because and that they implied like the
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:40.400]   The dye and the socks would seep into your bloodstream and kill you had to make a prediction
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:43.200]   That's a little bad
