[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.200]   This week in Google, it's really this week in 4G as we go around the world on this week
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   in Google.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.000]   Let's start with all the way over to the far left which is Kevin Marks.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.400]   Kevin Marks is in Seattle at a privacy conference right now.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   Kevin.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   That's right.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.520]   I'm at privacy identity innovation which is one of those conferences where different
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.200]   groups of people meet.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.360]   So there's tech people, there's lawyers and there's like legislative people as lawmakers
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.360]   as well.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360]   So it's interesting.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.360]   It's quite fun.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.160]   Kevin works of course at Salesforce, but he's an advocate of open standards.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.960]   Were you involved in OAuth?
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.200]   I was peripherally involved in OAuth.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.240]   I thought it to the internal security people at Google and they jumped away over it.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.400]   I was on the mailing list and listening, but I don't pretend to understand security
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.040]   well enough to comment, hopefully, on some of that stuff.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.200]   I just thought I listened to the even talk about it.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.120]   Authentication is a big part of not just identity, but security and privacy and all of that.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.520]   I was pretty as a breakthrough in this.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:55.760]   He also hosts a great show about Tummeling, which is the name that the old Yiddish comics
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.440]   and performers used in the Catskills.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.200]   The Tummler was kind of the social director, wasn't he, for those Catskills hotels?
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.240]   The one who got everyone to talk to each other and dance, yes.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.240]   Everyone needs a Tummler.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.400]   We'll make Kevin our honorary Tummler.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   Now look at this shot.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.600]   You're the Tummler earlier.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.160]   Look at this shot.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.120]   From Sydney Harbor at Jeff Jarvis at Buzzmachine.com.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.200]   If you're watching the video of this show, that is sunrise in Sydney.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.600]   Thank you for joining us so early in the morning, Jeff.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   My pleasure.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.440]   I'll get better light of myself soon, but I thought I'd give you a nice view of the bridge.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.360]   We were now looking at the opera house.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360]   We were looking at the opera house.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.360]   The harbor.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   Wow.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.960]   And I don't think we're going to see the opera house from here and not quite.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   Here's the good news.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.160]   For the first time ever, you don't look too pale.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.320]   What are you doing in Sydney?
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.640]   I'm at the Sydney Writers Conference Writers Festival.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.080]   I was speaking a couple of times.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.520]   Clearly, it's about privacy and publicness this year.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.160]   That's why I'm doing it.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.360]   And then I go on to Seoul next week.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.680]   This is so great.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   This is so fantastic.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.600]   Yes, we're missing you at PII, Jeff, because they were reminiscing about you coming over
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.040]   last year or the year before.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.760]   I wish I was sure that was a very good conference.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.760]   Good people.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   Really good people.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.240]   We will definitely get a synopsis of both of those conferences from you guys in just a
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   second.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.480]   I also want to introduce Gina Trapani, who, like me, is staying home this week.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.400]   My boring life.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.120]   We're sitting in my boring home office, but thrilled to be here as usual.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.680]   You should go to San Diego Harbor.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.320]   We can have an old harvest session.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.520]   Ah, we could.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.200]   We all harbor all the time.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.720]   I'll just go out by the Petaluma River, which is actually only posing as a river.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.240]   It's really a tidal slew.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.160]   It smells like one, I might add.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.560]   Top story today, Glee mentions Chipotle.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.560]   Huge.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.760]   I was so excited when that happened last night.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.120]   I was like, oh, now all we need is Gutenberg.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.120]   How about us in Google?
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.040]   If Glee ever mentions Gutenberg, then you know there's somebody in the screenwriting
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.040]   room who knows us.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.840]   That happens every once in a while.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.920]   There have been comic books, there have been TV shows that have had little inside mentions
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.320]   of stuff on Twitch.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.200]   This is kind of like a little wanker and nudge.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   So it could be.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   You don't know.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.560]   If they ever mention Twig on Glee, I will explode.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.200]   They won't do that.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.800]   But we'll know, Glee writer, anonymous Glee writer, we'll know if Gutenberg sneaks in.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   The will know.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   The harbor moss is a giver.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   I don't have a mask at all.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   I don't have a mask.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.040]   I still don't know who harbor moss is.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.680]   The only guy I've ever heard talk about it is this guy, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.880]   And I get in trouble for it every time.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.880]   Well, you shouldn't.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.200]   There was a fake how a must Twitter account at one point.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   What do you say?
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   He was a German philosopher.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   Is that who he is?
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   He is alive.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   He is alive.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   Chad.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.720]   We've got a new producer, by the way, Chad Johnson on the board today.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.880]   Eileen, as you know, has departed the building.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.760]   But we'll be back on Monday for all that, Android.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.760]   Chad, let's book harbor.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.760]   Let's book them.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.760]   Let's get them on the show.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.760]   Wow.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.480]   And if you do do.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.400]   It's a recluse in Germany.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   Recluse.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   We like them even better.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.680]   We'll make sure to send him a 4G card so he can remain reclusive.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.680]   Wow.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.880]   There goes a vote behind this.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.880]   He's the fake account.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880]   Look at that.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.880]   Look at this.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.640]   This is the best looking twig ever.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.720]   There's the Sydney Harbor comes to life behind Jeff Jarvis.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.600]   So I don't know where to start here.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.880]   There are a lot of stories.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.880]   Matt cuts.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.240]   I will just give you right at the top.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.440]   He's going to be joining us for triangulation.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.440]   This afternoon.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.440]   Great.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.440]   Great.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.440]   That's 4PM Pacific, 7PM Eastern time.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.280]   And he did a great little video.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.800]   Well, actually, he's done many great little videos.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.720]   And here is the mashup.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.160]   A fan mashup.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.000]   A fan mashup, not produced by Google of Matt cuts.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   How to rank.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.360]   Hey, this I think we can play this.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.920]   How to rank number one on Google with Matt cuts.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.920]   It's here.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   Hi, everybody.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.160]   Hello, you know, anybody's welcome to show up.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.560]   It's it's party in here.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.440]   So hi, everybody.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.440]   Matt cuts here.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   Wow.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.440]   So many questions.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.640]   We have a fun question today from a billion people in the Philippines.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.880]   Your master help videos are a big success.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.360]   And I think everybody loves them.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.360]   Yay.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.960]   It's a great help for webmasters.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.520]   But if one wanted to rank number one, how would you go about doing this?
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.400]   You know, on what basis are the results ranked?
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.400]   Wow.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   Really good question.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.440]   I don't think anybody's ever asked me that before.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:57.080]   Um, um, you know, um, um, so, um, so, oh, I know this answer.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.920]   Um, that's just poor guy.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.440]   Now, um, so very good question.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.920]   I'm glad you asked us.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   Um, rest.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   Oof.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.920]   That's a really interesting question.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.920]   Oh boy.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.920]   Okay.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.920]   Keyword density.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.920]   Let's talk about it a little bit.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.600]   There's one recipe and you can just follow that like, you know, baking cookies.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.080]   And if you follow it to the letter, you'll rank number one.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.680]   And that's just the way it works.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.760]   Um, that's pretty interesting.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.520]   It's about that word.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.800]   The next time you mention that word, oh, okay.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.320]   It's still about that word.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.280]   And once you start to mention it a whole lot, then that might help with your ranking.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.280]   Absolutely.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.920]   What is the ideal keyword density?
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.920]   The answer is 77%.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:43.560]   The same phrase on the page as many times as possible.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.800]   Um, there's lots of different factors that we're going to be ranked well.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:53.960]   But fundamentally, in addition to keyword stuffing, uh, we look at links to porn sites.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.280]   That makes me feel alone that much to sites within the porn industry.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.880]   That's the sort of thing that's, uh, going to be really rewarding for users.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.480]   So, yes, it could be annoying.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.400]   It could be annoying.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.200]   And that's perfectly fine.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.440]   Um, so now, so another thing is you will rank higher because you run AdSense.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.600]   Um, it's definitely the case that you get some boost because you run AdSense.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.520]   So I absolutely would recommend you run AdSense.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.840]   It's a really nice feature.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.960]   So yeah, uh, that would be an opportunity.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.800]   Um, so, you know, so that's just some very quick advice about how to rank number one.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   And, uh, you know, this made me feel really good.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.600]   I go to bed at night sleeping relatively well, knowing that I'm trying to change the world.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.000]   And I think that's fantastic.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.600]   But also, you know, I do think that Bing or Bleco or DuckDuckGo are potentially doing
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.280]   illegal things like hacking sites.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.280]   [laughter]
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.280]   I can stop hating on everybody for a second.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.280]   Peace out.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.280]   Spread the love.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   Don't worry about it that much.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.360]   And keep working on your making your own website as good as you can.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   Wow.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   Sam Applegate made that.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.360]   Thank you.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.360]   Bravo.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   Kudos, Sam.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.520]   Has nothing to do with Google and none of the advice is accurate.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   [laughter]
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.160]   As far as I know.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.840]   For those of you listening, you can see all that's different haircuts, different weight
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   loss stages.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.840]   There's one point he's completely shaving ball on it.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.720]   He's shaving during one of his 30 day deals.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.480]   So it's, you know what, I think that's adorable.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.080]   Matt is so, it's such a great, uh, frontman for Google and Google search.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.520]   As we, as you know, he's been on the show many times.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.680]   He's in charge of fighting spam on Google's web results, search results.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.680]   But he gives those great webmaster videos and I think that's, [laughter]
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.680]   it's a brain.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   No one does that for us.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.680]   That's all I can say.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.680]   [laughter]
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.680]   Right.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.680]   Other top stories.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.680]   Let's see.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.960]   Where to begin today?
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.800]   I don't, I don't have any, anything to hang my hat on.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.840]   Yeah, nothing screams this week.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.960]   I'm pretty excited that the, I finally got ICS on my big phone, like Alexi Note.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.400]   But you, wait a minute, you were an ICS hater before I thought.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.680]   Well, I don't like a couple of things I didn't like about ICS are fixed in, in the version
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   that Samsung pushed.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.160]   Remember this is Samsung's version.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.280]   So it has touch whiz and it has some new Samsung apps.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.880]   But the couple of things I didn't like, I don't like the Nexus because it doesn't have
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.880]   buttons.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.360]   And this of course, this phone has physical buttons.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   So yeah, I'll put it down here.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.360]   You can see it.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.960]   It means, you know, you don't lose the menu button.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.640]   So part of my complaint about ICS is that the buttons tend to, because they're all soft,
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.840]   they're all in software, they tend to be in different, the menu sometimes is here, sometimes
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.840]   is there.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.240]   I think that's bad design.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.160]   My other complaint about ICS was you were forced to have a Google on, on the Nexus anyway,
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.840]   a Google search box taking up considerable amount of space.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.200]   And on the bottom, the icon row.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:55.040]   So even on a big screen, you lost a lot of real estate to forced Google content.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.760]   That's not the case.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:03.520]   This, what's touch whiz is running is pretty much identical to the gingerbread version
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.320]   of this phone, except that it has now ICS running in the background.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.000]   So the user interface is nicer on some of the apps and things like that.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.240]   I think this is actually a good compromise for instance.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:19.120]   If I press and hold the home key, I now get the thing I think is completely useless, but
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.880]   some people like the task browser where you get the thumbnails of running applications,
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.240]   which aren't really running.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.640]   And so you still get that ICS feature, but it's not, it's not taking up a whole button
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.640]   really, right?
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.960]   I really don't like it that the home button does, or what is it?
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.640]   The recent button does that.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.000]   So you still have a back button, because that's a hardware back button.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.560]   You still have a menu button, because it's a hardware button.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   And those don't change even if you rotate.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.760]   So I think all in all this is good.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.200]   It feels a little sluggish in the note, to be honest with you.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.120]   I'm not sure if there's something I'm doing or if there's something that's going on with
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.240]   ICS on the note, but it did seem to slow it down a little bit.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.440]   So I don't know, there's nothing, that's not a story.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.920]   That's just, well, not to jump ahead, but Apple is rumored to be going to a larger
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.360]   screen, iPhone, right?
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.160]   Is there some magic moment coming some magic size?
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   No.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160]   No.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.160]   In fact, this is one of the reasons I like.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.440]   There was a great chart of Android fragmentation.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.760]   I'll pull it up and show it to you.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.440]   This is one of the reasons I like Android fragmentation.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   More choices.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.920]   So there is a sweet spot for every human.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.760]   Very few people like the Galaxy Notes.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.360]   Well, I shouldn't say that, because I think it's quite selling quite well.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.720]   But not everybody wants a 5.3 inch phone.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.000]   Some people want a 3.5 inch phone, like the iPhone.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.160]   Some people want a 4 inch phone.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.200]   And I think that's one of the nice things about Android is you have a choice.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   You don't have a choice right now in the iPhone.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.680]   You only have 3.5 inches, that's it.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.240]   Let me see.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.800]   This is kind of a wild.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:59.280]   This comes from the, there's some software that will let you, what is it, find, Wi-Fi
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.280]   access points.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.360]   I'm going to say I'm going to find this.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.960]   [SINGING]
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.040]   Open signal maps is an app on Android.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.400]   And it shows, and so when this is from that app, now this is going to be Android users
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.400]   who run open signal maps, which is a way to find open Wi-Fi access points.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.680]   So that's going to be kind of limited.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.760]   But I think that this is an interesting, if you look at, for instance, these are all
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.440]   the different, let's talk about fragmentation.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.440]   These are all the different Android models out there.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.600]   And if you look at, if I can find, I want to find the original article on OpenS.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.720]   This is from Boy Genius Report, but let me see if I can find the--
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.720]   I don't find, when I have a wardrobe, I don't find a single open network anymore.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.400]   You have Google managed to find if you want a street view, but that's pretty much it.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:55.280]   Open signal maps said there are 3,997 different Android devices running its app.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.000]   There's one iPhone, maybe no one to have it.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.080]   There's got to be more because there's for old ones.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:08.160]   So there's five iPhones or four iPhones, but there's 3,997 models of Android phones.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.720]   And each one has its own display resolution, its own screen size and all that, it seems.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.080]   So that's the negative, but I think it's also the positive that you have choice.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.080]   Right.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:26.840]   And you have an abstraction layer that actually works, which is the sort of the iOS you--
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.240]   everyone is now padding their apps with multiple different giant bitmaps to fit the multiple
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.960]   different screen sizes they've got there, because they've got four separate screen sizes
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   and two rotations.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.800]   So they end up with eight bitmaps, because they're doing everything with bitmaps, as
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.360]   opposed to doing it with layouts, which is a shame.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.360]   Right.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.360]   I mean, Gina, you're a developer.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.560]   You kind of know the pros and cons on both side, because you're-- to do text is on both
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.400]   Android and iPhones, right?
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.800]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.080]   I mean, you know, the nice thing about the way Android is structured is what Kevin said
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.900]   is that you design screens with relative layouts, similar to the way that you design
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.900]   what you do with it.
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.900]   Right.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:06.240]   Yeah, so if you expand the size of the screen, the screen can fill it, right, a certain way.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.720]   And that's why on Android, you know, apps that run on the small handset that don't have
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.480]   crazy graphics that aren't games that have, you know, extreme graphics can just expand
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:20.040]   to fill the screen, that's really nice, because I have one app on Android.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.040]   It runs on every--
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.040]   Right.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.040]   So, you know, you have a big, big screen on the small screen.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.840]   You know, on iPhone, like Kevin said, you design straight to the screen.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.320]   I mean, the small screen in the right of display and in the big screen in the right
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.800]   of display, and it's different resolutions and graphics.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.240]   So, you know, on one side, you get maybe design that's, you know, you're more sure that it's
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.080]   going to work everywhere, but at the same time, it's, you know, you get a lot of apps
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.640]   that you have to, you know, increase to two times size, or, you know, you have that problem
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.440]   that we've talked about before, where you're running iPhone apps on the small screen.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.040]   You know, the fragmentation, it's a double-edged sword, right?
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.680]   It's like consumer choice and apps that are relative layout, but at the same time, for
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.240]   a developer, you know, it's not clear, it's like, what should I develop to?
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.440]   You know, every month, you kind of have to check the charts, okay?
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.440]   What version should I develop to?
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.560]   You know, how many--how many emulators do I have to run?
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.840]   You know, I've got--you know, I've got--in my Android development setup, I've got, you
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.280]   know, a list of 10 different emulators and screen sizes that I want to launch my app
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.280]   and in testing, so it makes it more complicated.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.840]   And it's not just screen size, it's also API and OS version, right?
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.120]   Absolutely, and it's whether or not there's a keyboard, a hard keyboard or a soft keyboard.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.720]   I mean, there's a lot of different--there's a lot of different variables.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.740]   Now, let me temper that number 3,997.
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:39.560]   Part of that is because every custom ROM kind of identifies differently.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:47.080]   So there--of the 3,997 devices, 1,363 appear only once.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.960]   So you could probably take those--take those off the list.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.080]   But there are--somewhere, there are thousands.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.480]   The Samsung brand is a clear winner.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.520]   40% of the market.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.520]   Wow.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.960]   40% then HTC.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.280]   But this is where it gets challenging for the developer.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:09.720]   This is the API level, and it goes everywhere from Android 1.6 to Android 3.0.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.360]   Yeah, that's what gets--to 3.2.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.920]   It gets very difficult.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.360]   And then this is the resolution scatter chart, which is all over the place.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.600]   Yeah, these are some incredible charts.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.800]   I mean, as a developer, you pick out the biggest slices of the pie and you develop to those.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.800]   But that stinks because then you have users who write and say, "Hey, I've got this crazy
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.080]   model at this strange screen size that three other people have.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.040]   I can't run your app."
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   That gets--that's hard.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.680]   Here's a great one.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:48.160]   This is a graphic that shows the various variations in screen size on Android.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.760]   And then I'll scroll down and this is Apple.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.400]   And then Apple has four lines.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.240]   So--but I don't--you know, I hate to say fragmentation.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.400]   That's a loaded word.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.400]   I like to use the word choice.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   I agree.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   I don't think that developers--
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.400]   Diversity.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.400]   --they're first to do.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   Users matter, right?
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.640]   Like to me, it's like making life harder on developers for the sake of giving users more
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.640]   choice.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640]   Like, that's the right balance.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.840]   You know, as a developer, I'm not going to blame these companies for making my life harder.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.480]   My life, that's my job.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.480]   Right?
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.560]   If it's harder--you know, if it's a little bit harder for me to develop for more users
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.000]   than like, so be it.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.680]   I mean, of course, there are ways to get around this with better development tools and that
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.680]   kind of thing.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.080]   And Google, you know, has a long way to go with that.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.240]   But we should always err on the side of giving the users a better experience.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.400]   And, you know, it's arguable whether or not a lot of choice, the paradox of choice, is
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   a better experience.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.320]   I don't have that conversation, but definitely, you know, better for developers versus better
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.080]   for users, we should always err on the side of better for users.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.840]   Now, Fred Flintstone on our chatroom who is an iOS developer says, "No, no, there is
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.440]   screen layout support on iOS.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.560]   There is some way of handling a variety of orientations and resolutions.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.400]   I don't--I'm not familiar with it, so I don't know.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   I have to defer to those.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.040]   Well, there's interface builder springs and layouts, things, but it's not quite as
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.240]   flexible as the Android one.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.400]   In your face building, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.040]   Yeah, it's not definitely not as flexible as Android.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.640]   Android will just kind of flow it.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.800]   It's what we call--on the website, they call it--what did they call it?
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.160]   Adaptive, resizing, there's a word for it.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.160]   Because you don't know what--
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.160]   Responsive design is what you--
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   Responsive design.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.160]   Responsive design.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.240]   Because you don't know--not only do you not know what the resolution, but you don't
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.440]   know how big the window is or how wide it's going to be.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.200]   You don't know anything about it.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:40.360]   So I run my browser narrow with an echo font down the side, and too many sites don't cope
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.240]   with my browser being slightly narrower than 1.024 and give me horizontal scroll bars,
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.240]   which is really stupid.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:50.440]   Well, I want you to--when we get our new tech guy's site up, which is supposed to be responsive
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.880]   lullaby, it's really good.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.520]   I want--I'm going to say, "Hey, Kevin, how's it look on your browser?"
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.480]   Not that you'd ever listen to the radio show, but just--just--just--just--little feedback
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.600]   on that would be very valuable.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.880]   Yeah, so I thought that was kind of an interesting graphic.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.880]   I like that.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.480]   Now, get ready because here comes Android 5.0.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:17.120]   We're currently at 4, which is I, Scream Sandwich, and Jelly Bean is next, and according to a
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:23.960]   report in the Wall Street Journal, Jelly Bean will be deployed not on a single Nexus smartphone
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.800]   as they have done up to now, but on perhaps as many as 5 models this fall.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.160]   Welcome to diversity.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.280]   They're all named Nexus.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.360]   They're all named Nexus.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.960]   Last month, Google began selling an unlocked variation of the Galaxy Nexus, which runs
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.600]   Android 4 for $400 via Google Play.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   I didn't know that.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.680]   They went back to selling their own version.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.440]   That was something they did with the Nexus 1, and then pulled back.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.600]   So maybe they will start doing that again, doing their own channel.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.480]   I didn't even realize they had done that again.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.480]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.480]   You can buy it.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.360]   $400 for the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.920]   I don't think the Galaxy Nexus was at any point, maybe briefly, the best Android phone
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.080]   out there, but it's not close now.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.920]   There's the HTC One.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.880]   There's the Galaxy S2, which I thought was better.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:21.400]   There's the note, depending on what you need, but at least there's a vanilla experience
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.960]   for people who want it.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.360]   There's a great scene in one recent episode of Mad Men where they're, like, going in a
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.840]   picture client with two different ideas, and Don leaves one of the ideas in the cab and
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.360]   just pitches them one.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.760]   And later on, one of his people says to him, "Why did you drop off that other idea?
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.760]   Why didn't you pitch them both?"
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.720]   And he said, "I picked one idea and I went with one idea because when you go with more
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.680]   than one, it's weak."
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.480]   And that's very much the actual way.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   Like, we're going to give you what we think is the best for you, and you accept it or you
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.320]   don't, whereas this is the other way around, where it's like, let the customer choose.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.840]   Steve Jobs always said, "You have a choice.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.080]   Use Apple or not."
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.080]   That's your choice.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.560]   And if you choose Apple, we'll choose the rest.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.200]   We'll take care of the rest.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.360]   And then, you know what, it's interesting because I think you and I, Gina, fall in that other
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.640]   camp we want the choice.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.760]   We like the idea of having a more open platform, but they're obviously the market has told
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.760]   us.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.040]   It shows us that a lot of people want to have everything done for them.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.040]   This hand-in-hand of them.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.080]   I like thinking about your users and your customers as smart people who know what they
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.040]   want, and that it's not always the same.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.240]   I don't think that there's a one-size-fits-all.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.920]   I never believe that there's a one-true way.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.760]   I think that there are some people who feel very strongly.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.000]   They want a hard keyboard, and some people who want a bigger screen.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.520]   And for me, it's a matter of treating your customers like they're smart people.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.040]   The way that you treat your viewers, like they're smart audience.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.320]   I think saying, "I know better than you," is there's a level of arrogance there that
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   it's just not my way.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:58.560]   And yet, P.D. Barnum said you never went broke underestimating the American public.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.560]   Right?
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.560]   Yep.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.560]   Look at this.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   Sun's coming out in Sydney Harbor, and Jeff's still freezing.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.760]   No, it's not that bad.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.280]   It's just freezing, and I'm causing no worries.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.280]   I know.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.280]   No, we like it.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.280]   Just stay where you are.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.160]   The more you move, the worse your audio is, because it breaks up.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.080]   That's just a beautiful view.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.080]   Beautiful view.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.640]   Jeff's still an iPhone user.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.760]   We pick on him.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.760]   We tried.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.920]   Actually, I am too.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.920]   I carry both.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.920]   In fact, you know what?
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   Something happened.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.160]   I don't know if anybody in our audience has had this happen.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.840]   All of a sudden, Google Voice is going right through for some people who call me.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.120]   Some people can get through.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.080]   Others go right to voicemail.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.440]   And there's no apparent setting in Google Voice.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.320]   I mean, I know that that's a setting where you could say, "Go right through."
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.800]   I turned off the spam filter.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.760]   And so, unfortunately, it's my kids who can't call me.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.880]   So I have to carry an iPhone so they can continue to call me.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.880]   I know.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   No, that's not good.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.680]   I know.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.680]   Very frustrating.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.520]   At least it's all a blackberry, Leo.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.840]   And kids, call me on the blackberry.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.520]   I just can't figure-- don't show this, Jack, because it's got all my phone numbers on it.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:17.440]   But I just can't figure out why it's bouncing only calls from certain numbers.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:24.480]   I wonder if they've got interconnect problems, because they do explicitly block some exchanges
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.240]   with Google Voice, because they're the ones that--
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.240]   Are spammers?
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.240]   No.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:35.520]   They're the ones that offer free conference calls stuff, because they are raw exchanges
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.960]   that get a large amount of cross payments from other ones.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.960]   Well, yeah.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.000]   There's some weird interconnect rules in
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   that maybe that's it.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.400]   There's a nice spam filtering checkbox, which sends calls and text messages from numbers
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.200]   identified as spam by Google directly to the spam folder.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.640]   So that one I turned off, that didn't seem to make any difference.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.640]   I just wonder if there's a bug.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.920]   I think it feels like there's a bug.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.440]   It happened all of a sudden.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.400]   I bet it goes away.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.600]   MXX says his dad who's on sprint always gets forward to do voicemail.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.160]   So maybe there is something going on.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.720]   Maybe there's a little something, something.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.720]   And Lance's a side minute in the chatroom.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.240]   We love the folks who watch live.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.240]   Thank you.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.240]   Say, no, start--
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.240]   You're here.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.480]   It's not like he's got a link to a talk support note, but this isn't that.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.480]   This isn't that.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   Answer.py.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   It is.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   It's answer.py.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.480]   It is answer.py.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.480]   It is answer.py.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.480]   It's answer.py.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.480]   That means it's a Python script.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.480]   We love their Python script support.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.200]   We're going to take a break.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   Come back with more.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.880]   Jeff Jarvis is in Sydney Harbor.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.880]   Well, not in the harbor.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.880]   He's on the edge of Sydney.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.880]   That may come next.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.680]   Where the sun is coming up, Buzzmachine.com is his blog.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.400]   His new book is Public Parts.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:53.600]   He is, in fact, talking about privacy and publicness in Sydney for writers.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.600]   Is that right?
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   It's for writers.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   It's a writers festival.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.440]   We're just having so much fun we writers.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.120]   We get together and you don't know the fun we have, we writers.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.160]   Do you get to wear a tweed coat with patches and smoke a pipe?
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.160]   Because that's what I want.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.360]   Also with us Kevin Marks, who's at a privacy and identity conference in Seattle.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.720]   He would have a view of the harbor, but we told him to go inside.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.280]   I never got to see this.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.440]   If I go that way, I can see the space in the left.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.480]   We almost had a two harbor view.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.800]   That would have been something.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.600]   And Gina Trapani, who's indoors.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.160]   She's a blogger at smartaware.org.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.000]   We're brought to you today by stamps.com.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.360]   We love to talk about solutions and make your life easier.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.560]   Stamps.com is a really good example.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.160]   Never go to the post office again.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.120]   How do you like that?
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:50.360]   Because you can do it all from your computer, Mac or PC and stamps.com.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.840]   I love this solution.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.720]   Stamps without any, you don't need a postage meter.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.040]   You don't need a special ink or anything.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.040]   Just your regular everyday printer.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:03.800]   They even will give you a USB scale that you put into your computer and then you just
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.680]   throw what you want to mail on there and you always have exactly, precisely the right
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.680]   postage.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.680]   You don't waste a penny.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.440]   Now, see that $110 value now?
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.240]   If you won't see that special deal, if you just go to stamps.com, you've got to go to
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.360]   stamps.com and click the radio microphone in the upper right hand corner.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.440]   See that?
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:28.160]   And then you'll get the special deal when you use the offer code TWIG, TWIG.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:33.760]   You'll get $55 in postage coupons, the digital scale, the supply kit, and a four week trial
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.040]   all you have to do is use our offer code TWIG.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   This is a great way to find out if stamps.com is right for you.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.320]   I'll tell you, if you are an Amazon or eBay seller, you've got to use stamps.com.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:51.760]   It automatically fills out the forms, prints the postage directly from eBay or Amazon with
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.080]   all the information they know.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.080]   They give you discounts.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.080]   You cannot get it.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:03.080]   The post office up to 21% on an express mail shipping, priority mail up to 15% discounts.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.160]   I mean, these are good things.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.400]   It's a really great deal.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:13.600]   They even have no monthly fee, no service fee for high volume shippers.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:18.880]   So if you're in it, if you use a lot of US Postal Service, you really got to be doing
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   this.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.520]   You're crazy if you don't do this.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:29.560]   Stamps.com is the offer code TWIG to get started with that $110 no risk trial.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.760]   We use it here like crazy.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.600]   I think we got several accounts actually.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:44.400]   So Bing.com is going straight after Google and everybody else with their new social search.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.320]   The idea, here we go.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.560]   In fact, I could show you.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.960]   Do you want to go on the tour?
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   Because I got it.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.360]   It got turned on for me yesterday.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.440]   Yeah, let's look at the tour.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   What's the tour of the new Bing?
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.520]   So you'll see on the right hand side, because I'm logged in, friends who might know, I'm
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:06.680]   searching for movies, friends who might have something to say about movies, you could add
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.680]   your own comments here, ask friends what they think, choose the friends you want to ask,
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.680]   then write a comment to get their ideas.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.520]   I'm thinking about seeing the new Avengers movie.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:20.040]   But I just want to know, is Diana Rigg in it?
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.920]   And then you should take that.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   Just to see what people say.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.960]   Is that what it is actually what I thought when I saw that I'm?
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.200]   I was saving for just sweet and reboot of that.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.680]   Josh, come on.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.680]   Em appeal.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.600]   John Steed, together again.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.480]   Fighting crime in a cat jumpsuit.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.480]   Okay, so you can do that.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.400]   You can show friends what you found, add results you found from this and other searches.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.440]   There's a little button, a link button.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.280]   Let your friends see what you're thinking about.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.080]   Share your search on Facebook.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.320]   I just searched for herpes.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.520]   Would you like to join me?
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:06.840]   Okay, not all your searches are probably appropriate for sharing on Facebook.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:12.640]   So now this is of course better if you search for things like movies or music.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.520]   It'll give you more information.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.320]   If you search for Jeff Jarvis, let me see.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.320]   I just had a curious.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.320]   Uh oh.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.320]   And herpes.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.840]   Now, look at MG.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.600]   It's a particular posted, Ralph Needleman posted, but it doesn't seem to be related.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:31.720]   Ralph's looking for an Audi A3 with the sequential automatic transmission.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:36.520]   And Robert Scobull says, huh, this is one way to get me to try being Google has locked
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.520]   me out.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.520]   That's nice.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.680]   So these are all these detector analysts who are trying out.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.800]   Yeah, no one else is using it except my three friends who are tech journalists.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   Actually, I don't have any.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.360]   I don't have any normal friends.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.360]   That's why.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.280]   So this is interesting.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.080]   I mean, I think how is it different than search plus your world?
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.480]   You sign in a Facebook.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.880]   Because search plus your world uses uses just G plus.
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.880]   So that's the biggest difference.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.720]   You can sign into Windows live too if you want to.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.880]   Yeah, I have, I have both.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:14.040]   So it's just going to have a problem like the social news reader that people are going
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.400]   to get freaked on Facebook when they see their searches.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.960]   They forget they sign in for it.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.960]   Suddenly the herpes.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:25.600]   I think you have to explicitly say, I'm searching for genital warts.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.800]   Would you like to join me?
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.480]   And then it will.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.480]   I'm sorry, folks.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.240]   I didn't deserve that.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.600]   Now what's interesting is that there are three columns now in search and the ad column
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.920]   is front and center really because it's the middle column, which typically right is the
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.960]   is the content column.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.960]   Right.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.960]   So.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.960]   Oh, it is.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.960]   I'm not saying that one, man.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.960]   I am.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.960]   Look at this screen.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.400]   There's my search for Jeff Jarvis.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.400]   Yeah, you've got that narrow.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.880]   It's responsive.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.760]   So I have on the left, I have search results on the right.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.640]   I have social activity.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.120]   And by the way, I have added my Windows live account as well as my Facebook account.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:11.920]   You know what I haven't joined because it just seems so down market being rewards.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.080]   The more you search, the more you win.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.080]   It's like, yes, an agent.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.920]   What was that old search engine that gave away a million dollars supposedly?
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.960]   It was an ask.com that did that.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.960]   No.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.920]   There's another one.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.760]   The whole stick was that you searched there to have money.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.760]   Right.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.760]   Right.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.760]   Every click makes you money.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.920]   It was one of those things that was going to take over the web.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.600]   I'm kind of surprised that Microsoft would do that.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.480]   It feels like green stamps.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   Cheesy.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.760]   It's kind of cheesy.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.240]   It's kind of cheesy.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.440]   And by the way, we all have the same number of reward points.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.280]   I have 24.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.040]   Now, I chat with somebody who has 23.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.040]   And I'm not even signed in.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.960]   So I guess they just give you some default number.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.520]   But see, right in the middle there is the search.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.960]   Now the ads for Jeff Jarvis are, you'll like this.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.640]   Discountbooksale.com offering what Google do.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.640]   Well, I was sure of the buy-up grad.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.480]   At a low, low price.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.760]   Low prices on Jeff Jarvis, qualified orders over $25 ship free.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.480]   We found Jeff Jarvis at PeopleSmart.com.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   These are the junk ads that you get whenever you search for a person named.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.760]   See, the problem is Google would know me better.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.560]   And there would be buy-ups there.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.600]   Shall we compare it?
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.640]   I'm just curious.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.720]   I don't think there are ads on your Jeff Jarvis.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.000]   I don't know why nobody buys Jeff Jarvis.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.760]   Right.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.360]   Well, nobody but-- I guess somebody
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.480]   buys just personal names, right?
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.680]   Yeah, there's no ads on Jeff Jarvis on Google.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.080]   You're ad-free.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.040]   Oh, whoo-hoo.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.800]   I hate it when you search for a person's name
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.720]   and you get those ads from my life in USA people's search
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.920]   and all that crap.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.520]   I think that's really bad.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.520]   Yeah, full of crap.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:49.800]   So it's interesting.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.680]   I searched for you, Leo, and it points out that you tweet,
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.920]   and it gave me a link to your Twitter account.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.960]   That's good.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.880]   And I searched for myself, and it said,
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.840]   "Geniz on Google+" and gave information.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.920]   That's very interesting.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.600]   I think that's the key difference between this and Search
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   Plus Your World is that you can not only--
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.400]   Yeah, it's agnostic.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.280]   Not only can you sign in with both Facebook or Windows Live,
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.280]   but it's returning results from Twitter, Google+,
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.400]   I mean, it's returning results from competitors.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.320]   Of course, the underdog is kind of going to do this.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:20.840]   It's got to.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.320]   So this is interesting.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.160]   I searched for myself.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.240]   Paul Therat has photos of Leo Laporte.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.000]   Connect with Facebook, so you and your friends can each--
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.960]   Wow.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.400]   And then it has my Twitter account.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.680]   Wow.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.960]   Very interesting.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.320]   We connect with Facebook and see--
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.880]   OK, I'm now allowing Bing to post on my behalf.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.880]   That's always scary.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.720]   Don't you love that?
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.840]   Now I see that Trey has posted pictures of me.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.280]   Paul, Sarah Lane.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:50.760]   Oh, dear.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.880]   It says Sarah Lane has a photo of Leo Laporte.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.280]   I probably don't want to see that.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:59.480]   That scares you, doesn't it?
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.240]   I know what you did last night.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.080]   Oh, my God.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:02.880]   These are weird.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.720]   OK, let's not click that.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.040]   When you get that DM saying, they're
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.920]   these weird photos of you in Twitter.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.640]   When you get that on Facebook, it usually is a virus saying,
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.520]   I know what you did last night, and I have video to prove it.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.840]   And then they get you.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.640]   But for you, is it was true?
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.140]   Yeah.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:22.840]   In fact, there is video.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.280]   It has to go virus Leo.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:29.160]   So what do you think?
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.840]   How does Bing steal market share from Google?
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.440]   This?
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:38.720]   My fear is that it has to Google stuff later.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.800]   I think this goes back to your argument before.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.760]   Search is now getting very cluttered.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.080]   It's like Yahoo takes over the world.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.160]   God, that's a depressing thing.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.320]   They're adding more stuff on trying to make you--
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.480]   ours is better, but no, ours is better.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.880]   We have free jalapeno peppers on our search.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:01.120]   Do any of you have the new Google knowledge graph stuff
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.280]   showing up yet?
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.160]   How do you get that?
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.680]   So this is the technology is being
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.280]   used to provide popular facts about people, places,
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.800]   things alongside Google's traditional results.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.200]   It looks like a Wikipedia box, but there may be a bit more
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:14.680]   split than that.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.120]   Or the baseball cart, the digital age.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.680]   I like this idea.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.440]   Knowledge graph flows into units.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.720]   They have no official name.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.240]   So Danny Sullivan writing on search engine land
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.200]   says he calls them knowledge panels.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.320]   They don't always appear, only showing up on Google
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.280]   deems them relevant.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.000]   I think this does not bother me, but you're right.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.040]   It is cluttering, right?
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:40.920]   That's the only thing.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.320]   Yeah, I'm afraid we're going to get into a war,
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.000]   and the whole world is going to look like Yahoo.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.960]   And you know what happened to Yahoo, folks?
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.120]   Google says it's compiled--
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.920]   I think Google's A/B testing will be fairly good at making
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.280]   them the right size.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.400]   That kind of optimization they're good at.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.360]   All right, I'm going to search--
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.440]   I'm going to now cute-cutely, I'll
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.640]   complain about the addition of Google+ to search.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.960]   Yeah, I wasn't too happy about it.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.160]   So I guess I'm not getting it, because I searched for a movie
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.760]   star, and that would be what you'd get.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.080]   So they say they've compiled 3 and 1/2 billion facts,
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.320]   information about, and relationships between 500 million
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.640]   objects or entities.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.640]   Entities are persons, places are things.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.800]   So I'm assuming this is the free-based stuff, but--
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.560]   So what is free-based?
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.040]   Is that an acquisition that Google made?
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:37.680]   Yes, so it was a semantic mesh, basically, of information
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.360]   like that.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.040]   A lot of it is based on Wikipedia.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.720]   A lot of these semantic things end up being useful,
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.800]   useful crawls of Wikipedia.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.720]   Do you think that's a potential--
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.240]   But it's still a source for you.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.640]   I think Microsoft is using the same data set for their stuff.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.960]   Do you think that's a potential problem?
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.040]   Because what it's kind of doing is putting Wikipedia
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.560]   information on the web without really highlighting
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.560]   it's from Wikipedia.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.520]   And I know there's a lot of schools and people who say,
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.440]   ah, you're not allowed to use Wikipedia information,
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.560]   because I trust Wikipedia.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.400]   But you're not allowed to use it in a lot of schools, for
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.760]   instance.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.480]   And this is kind of--
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.840]   Well, it's not just using the information.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.080]   It's crypto-wickipedia.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:19.800]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.920]   But it's not just using the information.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.120]   As Kevin says, it's what it's really first trying to do is
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.040]   to recognize entities.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.720]   Daylight has a very smart engine doing that as well.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.600]   We're full disclosure of my partner.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.320]   But what they want to know is the entities.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.160]   So once you know the entities, then you can say, ah, well,
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.960]   here's all the stuff we know about that entity.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.840]   And here's the relationships with that entity to other
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.840]   entities.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.320]   And here's patterns of the entities.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.240]   Did you get that--
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.640]   Chad, so Chad's turned on.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.040]   Oh, yeah, that's it.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.560]   That's it.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.080]   Chad, we know a lot about you.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:49.600]   You're right.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.160]   Brad, it as your default here?
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.200]   Well, I searched bicycle, and nothing came up.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:54.560]   So--
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:40:01.560]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.560]   It should find out.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.560]   It's a good test.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.280]   It will not find Habermas.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.360]   Now, one thing that I did was I signed out of my apps account
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.120]   and signed into my Gmail account.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.320]   So if you're signed into apps, it may not be available.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.440]   Now, in Docs, now you have this too.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.600]   So if I type Brad Pitt in a doc, I can right-click on it.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.120]   So probably it'll report.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.960]   Well, see, I think I don't have it turned on.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.960]   Are you in Docs?
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.680]   Once again, that's--
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.400]   I'll say apps.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.880]   You're using Google Apps as twit.tv.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.160]   So if you sign out, you'll get it.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.360]   Do an incognito window.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.840]   Oh, an incognito window.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.880]   Because I switched, and it didn't help.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.880]   Yeah, it's not working for me.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.320]   So if it's turned on for your IP range, it might work.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.520]   OK.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.560]   Chad got it.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:46.920]   So we've got it.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.960]   Yeah, so I turned it on over here.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.440]   Let me get to the correct thing.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.560]   And so we're in that-- this is the Twitcraft doc.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.000]   And so you turned on research over here.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.800]   Oh, it's now a bar.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.320]   Right.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.560]   On the document.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.680]   Exactly.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:06.880]   So maybe I wanted a quote that started with Minecraft.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.480]   And let's see.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.120]   No quotes with Minecraft.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.880]   Let's not do that.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.920]   Let's say Google.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.400]   Search everything instead.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.360]   OK, now we have--
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.000]   this is very small.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.200]   So did you sign out of all Google?
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.000]   No, I did the double sign in.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:24.680]   OK.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.600]   Where if you scroll back up here--
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.680]   Your sign in either of those, right?
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.840]   So there's my other email address.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.320]   And here's the apps account.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.360]   So Google Apps for Business.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.960]   Now, this doesn't seem very relevant.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:41.680]   I don't know how I'd-- I guess I'd insert this link into--
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.680]   could I drag it over?
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.960]   I guess I'd cite this.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.880]   I mean, this seems-- now it's added a little one over here.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.240]   Yeah, and then I put the footnote.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:50.600]   Look at that.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.400]   It's going to-- so describe because people
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.760]   are listening as well as watching.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.440]   Right.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.480]   So there's this little bar on the side.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.280]   And so let's search for something more relevant.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.440]   It's not so little, by the way.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.280]   It's a fairly wide column.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:06.360]   Let's say architecture.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.480]   And I'm butchering architecture.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.560]   ARC.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.160]   Oh, that worked.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:11.600]   Look at that.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:11.960]   Perfect.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.080]   So Wikipedia is the first result.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.680]   Right.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.040]   But there's other stuff like--
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.480]   Let's say in this document, this is man.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.800]   I really want to use that.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.480]   That's what I want in my thing.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.480]   So let's drag it into Thomas.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.880]   You just drag that in.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.720]   So you dragged an image of the Python on it or whatever.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.360]   Right.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.920]   And then it cited it already.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.840]   So there's a lot to do.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.520]   You're getting it.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.400]   And I'm not.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.960]   That's-- I want--
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   That's why I--
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.000]   I heard a--
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.080]   The Doc's stuff is separate, though.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.040]   You can--
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.040]   You can turn that on.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:42.240]   Right.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.360]   Yeah, you can turn that on.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.160]   Where do we turn that on?
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.280]   Is there a setting?
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.080]   In the Tools menu, there's an item called Research.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.760]   Or research, I think.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.600]   No.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.760]   It has to be in a--
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.560]   When you join a Doc, you do Control Alt R.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.040]   OK, right.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.040]   And that brings up the research tab.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.640]   The keyboard shortcut.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.120]   Or R.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.960]   But once again, I don't think it works for Google Apps yet.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.880]   Maybe it doesn't work in Safari, which I'm using.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.160]   So OK.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:09.800]   OK.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.440]   This is kind of-- I guess--
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.400]   I think this is cool.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.840]   You know this strikes me who this might before
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.200]   is tablet users who don't have Windows.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.920]   Because one of the things-- one of the issues--
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.160]   you know, a lot of schools are looking at using say
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.040]   an iPad in school.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.160]   But the problem I have is I'm doing research,
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.320]   I'm doing a report.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.840]   All right, maybe I bought a keyboard
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.120]   because typing on glass is bad.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.600]   That's problem number one.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   But then the other problem is I'm not windowed.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.160]   So I'm writing, and then I have to go to another full screen
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.080]   to see something.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.200]   Well, what if I were writing in a Google Doc,
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.320]   and I had a research bar on the right,
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.440]   that would make it a lot easier, wouldn't it, on a tablet?
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.320]   I don't know if that's--
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.600]   Well, I guess it also tries to--
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.520]   Google wants to give you answers to any question,
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.160]   anytime, for any need.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:52.520]   Anywhere.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.800]   So when you're writing a letter or anything,
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.160]   the idea is get your answer right here right now.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:02.280]   By the way, if you're using Chrome,
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.960]   version 19 should have been pushed to you
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.680]   in the last few hours or days.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:11.040]   And you will get something very interesting that is definitely
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.040]   a geek feature, tab syncing.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:16.520]   Yes.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.360]   Did I tell you it was a geek feature?
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.480]   Tab syncing.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.360]   What does that mean?
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.480]   I don't understand.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.280]   Gina, what are we talking about here?
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.200]   So if you turn on tab syncing and you're running Chrome
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.760]   on, say, your Android handset, and when you launch Chrome
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.120]   on your Android handset, you can say,
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.360]   show me all the devices that have Chrome open.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.160]   You can switch to a different device
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.320]   and open up any one of the tabs, say, that's
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.440]   called on your computer.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.600]   So that doesn't open 48 tabs on my Android phone.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.600]   No, it doesn't.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.640]   That would be untenable.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.160]   OK.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   Yeah, it would be untenable.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.480]   It just says, hey, here's the name of your computer.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.480]   It's got tabs open.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.920]   Here's a list of the tabs that are open,
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.240]   and you can just tap one and open it.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:54.760]   Cool.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.120]   We're just supposed to be able to do that five versions ago.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.960]   You're supposed to have the tabs go across and never work for me.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.680]   It's been in the beta.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.400]   This tab sync has been in the Chrome beta for a while,
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.440]   but it just got released to the stable version 19.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.200]   And there's been syncing from Chrome to Chrome on desktops.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.400]   But I think this is the first time it's--
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.640]   correct me if I'm mistaken, chat room.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.160]   I think this is the first time it's going to Chrome on Android.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.040]   I could never get it to work on desktop to desktop.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.480]   That's just me.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.400]   I can't get Wi-Fi to work, so.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.240]   And would it be in my Chrome settings that I would enable this,
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.000]   or is it just enabled by default?
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.360]   Yeah, I know it's not enabled by default.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.600]   I had to turn on.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.440]   If you click on the wrench and go to Settings,
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:43.200]   and then it's the Advanced Sync Settings button.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.400]   And then you have to be logged in to Chrome
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.360]   as your Gmail account as well.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.640]   Yes, at the top of the page, Leo,
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.800]   on the right advanced sync settings.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.080]   OK.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.880]   Scroll up.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:57.440]   Yeah, Advanced Sync Settings.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.040]   OK.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.360]   Oh, there it is.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   I'm signing as Leo.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:05.160]   OK, now my Advanced Sync Everything, encrypted data types.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.240]   Oh, look, you don't have it.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:06.760]   I don't have it.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.640]   Even though I did check, and I am on Chrome 19.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.920]   That checkbox is right below theme.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.400]   The theme is one more item in that checkbox.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.400]   Yeah, I guess it's going to be on Chrome 19.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.040]   Chrome is up to date.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.040]   Wacky.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.400]   Wacky is right.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.800]   They're holding out on its Google today.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.400]   They're like, "Twit, blacklist."
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.080]   You know what?
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.160]   That's what it is.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.360]   Except for Chad.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.120]   Chad, I bet you have it.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.120]   It's like that, Chad.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.200]   I'm not signed in on this computer.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:33.720]   All right.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.400]   Yeah, we don't want to-- yeah, that's a public computer.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.920]   We don't want to sign in there.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.920]   Huh.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.080]   Maybe you have to be on the Google+ suggested user list
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:43.360]   before we go.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.360]   Oh.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.640]   I'm off it, by the way.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.600]   I'm off it.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.000]   Oh, you see, you should never have complained.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.280]   They don't mean-- I never complained.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:52.800]   What?
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.000]   But they don't mean--
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.360]   He's not a technology person.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.080]   Kick him off.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.120]   Kick him off.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.320]   That syncing is apparently rolling out slowly.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.920]   And because I had it, I just assumed
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.120]   that it was out to a lot of people.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:05.360]   But--
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.360]   Well, let me see if--
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.800]   Now, how would I know if it's on Android?
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.200]   Because it is supposed to be an ice cream sandwich.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.640]   So when I launched the browser, which is not Chrome,
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.120]   by the way, on Android--
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.680]   Well, this is the thing.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.840]   You have to be running the Chrome data on Android.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   Ah.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.000]   So this is--
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.160]   Not in the browser.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.560]   It's in the Chrome browser.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.080]   Right.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:24.560]   Right.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.400]   Can I get that from the Play Store?
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.840]   The Play Store, yep.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.440]   Isn't that sound stupid, just saying that the Play Store?
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.240]   I'm going to go look in the Play Store.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.080]   You're not going to get yourself back on that list, do you?
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:35.580]   No.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.120]   I'm talking like that.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.800]   I love Matt Cuts.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   All right.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.080]   All right.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.400]   I'm going to go look on the Play Store.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.160]   Chrome beta.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.680]   At least it's free.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.920]   And then so I would be able to then turn it on on the Chrome
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.600]   beta.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.840]   Then you'd be able to see-- you'd be able to say--
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.360]   there's a button.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.400]   I think it's in the menu.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.440]   It says request desktop site.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.720]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.240]   So that's kind of the next step of Chrome to phone, which
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.880]   has always been around as an extension where you could send
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.720]   to your phone any page you were looking at.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.720]   Now, if you just leave it open in Chrome,
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.720]   you'll be able to pick anything that any tab you've
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.760]   got open on your desktop.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.920]   Yeah, which sounds pretty geeky.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.320]   But the point in the future when Chrome is Android's default
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:19.520]   browser, and this all just sort of happens in the background.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.360]   If you're reading something on your computer
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.000]   and you've got to dash off to the dentist,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.680]   looking at it in the waiting room, that's a nice--
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.560]   it's a really nice feature.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.800]   Now, what if--
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.920]   I mean, this is a way of Google getting everybody
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.000]   to just use Chrome everywhere.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:33.560]   This is smart.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.120]   This is the kind of thing Apple does.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.320]   Although Apple doesn't do it.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.040]   And I wonder if people would get upset if Apple did this.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.960]   Well, I think Apple assumes that they're different experiences
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.800]   and you don't want to merge them.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.560]   Because that's a very different approach.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.040]   Ah, yeah.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.800]   Why would you want to do that?
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.200]   They're saying.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.680]   It is a geeky-- I have to say it's a geeky feature.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.400]   I don't think most people care whether they can do that.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.520]   But I think that geeks who use tabs like Crazy--
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.440]   I've never understood it.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.600]   If you ask a geek, anybody on any of these shows,
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.400]   how many tabs do you have up in Gina?
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.400]   Doesn't.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.840]   Oh, as always, too many to leave the title bar.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.840]   Yeah, a lot of tabs.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.840]   They're all little.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.320]   It's a sign of optimism in life.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.520]   I'll get to that later.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.520]   Aha!
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   Yes.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.280]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.520]   Oh, I'm going to read that.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.440]   Oh, yeah, definitely want to keep that around.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.440]   I'm never close.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.800]   It's the same people who have--
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.960]   It's hoarders.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.440]   It's digital hoarders.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.440]   Hey.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.440]   Hey.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   That was--
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.600]   Pretty soon you're not going to be able to walk down the hall in your house because
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   it's full of magazines.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   It's a bit.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   It's a bit everywhere.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.600]   Now it's just bits.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.400]   That was one of the conversations that the Providence
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:52.720]   community conference was discussing about whether you should design to minimize retained
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.720]   data.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.200]   And the comment was, well, engineers are hoarders.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.200]   They keep everything.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   They just log it all.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   Right.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.880]   They just go and find them and get them to delete it.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.200]   And I'm thinking, yeah, that's kind of true.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   We sort of log everything.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.000]   Well, because bits don't take any space, so why not?
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.520]   Well, we got space to store all this stuff.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.200]   And later on, you may want to debug that.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.400]   You also know what's going on.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.360]   And you don't want to value in it.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.040]   You can't predict the value today of what that data--
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.400]   anomalies will show you tomorrow.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.040]   Yeah, but I'm going to give you Leo's law.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:22.480]   The more stuff you hoard, the less value it has because you can't find anything.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.480]   Not data.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:24.480]   You have Google.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.480]   You have Google.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.400]   So this is the whole point of Google's worldview is we'll fix that for you.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.400]   Ah, we can find it.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.400]   Save it all.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.400]   It's in there somewhere.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:38.880]   It's like Gordon Bell, who was wearing the former digital equipment guy who went on
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:45.680]   to be a Microsoft fella and wears a camera around his neck that takes pictures every
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   few seconds of everything he does.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.960]   And he says, I'm not going to worry about that someday.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:49.960]   I'll need that.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:53.360]   He just has pictures of everywhere he's been everybody's talked to.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.560]   And what you're waiting for is the technology to catch up to do all the face recognition,
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:01.080]   for instance, and say, oh, yeah, you had a meeting with Kevin on Friday and you did
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.080]   this and talked about that.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:08.240]   But the other thing I do in Gmail is I will see an email on my phone or whatever.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:12.840]   And then I'll mark it as unread, believing that it will come back up with the list somehow
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.840]   magically.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.600]   And I will then deal with it later.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.600]   It is.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.600]   It is.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.360]   Instead, what happens is three weeks later somebody says, did you go by email?
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.240]   And I have to see my eyes roll.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.560]   I was vague memory.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.560]   I dimly read it.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.800]   I read it at one point.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   I handled it.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.240]   Yeah, this is you hit the nail in the head.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.520]   It's my John Paul of stars.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.520]   Yes.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.520]   Yes.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.520]   He's full of stars.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.360]   It is a form of optimism.
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.720]   I have four stars universe has.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:44.120]   You're all jolly jolly people who think the world is a good place.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:48.280]   And someday they'll be in an infinite amount of time to go through your stars.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.280]   Wow.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.280]   I like that.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   I like to just land on it.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.040]   We're going to take a break.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.480]   We're talking about the Google.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.560]   This weekend Google is on the air.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.280]   Jeff Gina and our guest today, Kevin Marks.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.880]   I want to ask you about PII in a second, Kevin, and what's going on?
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.840]   What's the latest in privacy and identity?
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.760]   But first let's talk Ting.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:13.720]   Why would a service asks Ting treat its best customers like criminals?
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:17.120]   Oh, you're talking about cell phone industry, aren't you?
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:20.480]   Where the you just you cannot.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.360]   You can never get out of it, right?
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:27.520]   You join it and for two years they own your, I want to say, you know what, but they own
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.000]   your tuckus.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.440]   Ting is totally reinventing the cell business.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.160]   Now Ting is using sprint.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:38.080]   So if you've got good sprint coverage where you are, Ting is going to be everybody as
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.080]   good as sprint.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:44.400]   They have great phones, but unlike everybody else, they have fees that are fair, honest
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:49.400]   and out there, forth, right, they believe in full disclosure.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:53.600]   And they never penalize you for using more than you said you would.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:59.280]   They refund you for minutes, text messages or data that you didn't use.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.800]   There is never an early termination fee.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.560]   Everything is month to month.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.120]   Oh, I love this.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.160]   You love your netcast.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.320]   How about your phone company?
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.520]   Ting welcomes twig listeners.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:09.520]   I love that.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.520]   That is really cool.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.400]   I love these guys.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.400]   They're doing right now.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.680]   They're doing a contest for May at the D, a dump your contract contest.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   They'll buy out one winners mobile service every day this month and sign up for Ting.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.680]   Ting.com/dyc.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:33.280]   They'll cut you a check to pay your early termination fee from anywhere from $100 to $300.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:39.000]   Ting.com/dyc, you could share your contract termination horror stories and follow contest
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   winners on Facebook.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   I love that.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.440]   And you can't enter every day to win.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.120]   So simple, honest, fair pricing.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.520]   You pay for just what you use.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:55.240]   Let's go to the plans page and you can see you can choose ahead of time how many phones
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.240]   you want.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:01.080]   So it's great for families or businesses, $6 per phone, flat fee once a month.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.800]   And then you choose how much data you're going to use, how many minutes you're going
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.320]   to use, how many text messages.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:10.720]   But do this kind of, you know, you don't have to, it doesn't matter really because you
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.200]   could pick zero across the board and you'd still pay the same amount.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:22.840]   If you pick the XXL 3000 minutes, 6000 text messages, 3 gigabytes of data and you don't
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.480]   use it, they refund your money.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.200]   So this is a really, I don't know, you know, this is like the phone company's got, this
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.320]   is Randall Stevenson is losing sleep over this.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.160]   He ought to be if he's not.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.240]   So look at that.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.640]   If you do that plan, it tells you kind of what it would be.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:42.520]   That's really what this is for us for planning because in truth, you only pay for what you
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:43.520]   use for.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.520]   There's never a penalty.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.320]   By the way, included free at all on all Ting phones at no charge voicemail, picture and
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:57.440]   video messaging, three way calling, caller ID, tethering and hotspotting at no additional
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.760]   charge.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.000]   And look at these phones, great phones from feature phones to the top of the line, smart
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   phones.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.920]   I would get the Galaxy S2.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.920]   That's my personal favorite, the 4G effect.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.080]   I use that on sprint and it's a great phone.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:17.520]   The Samsung conquer, they even have very inexpensive phones, basically burner phones.
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.080]   For 170 bucks, you can get the LG Optimus S. That's a great Android phone.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.920]   They say it's not a cheap Android phone.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.440]   It's an Android phone and a good price.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:33.000]   And I'm going to help you get 50 bucks off if you go to ting.com/twig, 50 bucks off of
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.800]   any of their phones.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:43.560]   Just pick the phone you like, subtract 50 bucks, save money, only, only use this, what you
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.000]   need and never pay a penalty.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   There's no waste.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.640]   It's wonderful.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:53.880]   These guys really, I hope they win because this is exactly how phone service should be.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:58.360]   Ting.com/twig, and to enter the contest, ting.com/dyc.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.360]   See, you can do both.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.360]   It's okay to do.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.360]   Hey, Ting guys.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.360]   Ting.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.360]   Get your fixed hotel Wi-Fi.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.360]   That's next.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.360]   You know what?
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.360]   You know what?
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.120]   It's Eliot Noss who runs two cows.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:11.720]   And he's fixed domain registration with Hover.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:12.720]   He's fixing the phones.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.480]   I wouldn't be surprised if the next thing is Hotel Wi-Fi.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:19.840]   Eliot, if you're listening, please, please, please.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.520]   So tell us about PII, Kevin Marks.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.920]   What is this about?
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.800]   So it's privacy, identity, innovation.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:33.480]   So it's the collection, Jeff, I think, came to the first one.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:37.000]   And it's, in some ways, it's the collection of people that Jeff rails against, because
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.280]   there are privacy commissions, people like that here.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:47.880]   But there are also geeks, people from Facebook and Twitter and me and EFF people.
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:52.160]   And there are also some lawyers who, thinking about privacy policies and things like that.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:57.080]   So it reminds me a bit of the Supernova conference where you would get a group of people, a
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:01.520]   group of people who are normally at loggerheads and not talking to each other and put them
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.360]   together for three days and get to talk to each other.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.160]   So it's very good from that point of view.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:09.760]   And I've been impressed with the conversations we've had here because they haven't been
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.280]   raiding at each other too much.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:14.000]   What are the problems that people feel we need to solve?
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.880]   I mean, I think when you say the word privacy, that's the problem.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:23.880]   But what are they identifying as the problem?
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:28.440]   The problem is to some extent, overreach and some extent leakage, that's what they're
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:29.440]   saying.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:33.600]   It's like, are you correlating things you shouldn't be correlating?
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.880]   And how do we stop that happening?
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:42.720]   And the debate is, do we make it an offence if somebody collects data they shouldn't?
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.600]   Or do we make it an offence if they use that data?
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:52.600]   But the interesting thing, one of the things has been, there's been a lot of public pressure
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:57.920]   when people discover apps are gathering information that they don't think that they need.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:02.920]   And having those things pushed out in public has actually caused the apps to draw back
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.160]   and then think more about what they should be collecting.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:12.520]   So that's actually been working better than legislators or even FTC suits in many cases
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.520]   to do that.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:20.880]   So the power of the web as public shame is working better as a sort of privacy restraint
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.560]   in many cases than government action.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.000]   And of course, the other half of this is that the governments do not talk about it
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.400]   as they're mounds because one thing they say, you can't collect this stuff and the other
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.160]   thing they say, you must collect this and give this to us.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.160]   Save it for us.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.160]   Exactly.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:39.360]   You can't collect this data, but can you send it to us?
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.360]   Yeah, we'll take it.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.360]   No, wait.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.360]   Hey, you could trust us.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.360]   We're the government.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.360]   Right.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:47.240]   And there's been a bit of pieces like that.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.120]   Who do you trust more, a large company in the government?
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.680]   And the answer tends to vary depending whether you're from the US or Europe.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:53.680]   Right.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:54.680]   Yes.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.680]   That's interesting.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.680]   It's purely cultural.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.680]   But it's a weird paradox.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:04.520]   When I was in Germany at Ray public a year ago, two years ago, presenting what was then
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:08.160]   to become public parts, I talked about the German paradox, the European paradox.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.680]   It's very stood up and said, well, that's the American paradox.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:14.400]   You've had a better government than we've had for much longer, but you all don't trust
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.400]   government.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.280]   And we have better companies, better regulation companies here.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.840]   We don't trust companies.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:21.840]   Yes.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:27.160]   So the other thing we're seeing is we're starting to see more of the personal local
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.360]   time projects and things like that show up, which I've put into those.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.040]   There's a good ideas.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:35.000]   And so some of the startups people have been showing off have been things like that.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   There's personal.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   There's--
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.800]   Kevin, Kevin, the other person.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:46.720]   The locker idea versus the server of your identity ideas, the locker just a place to
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:51.440]   store your own stuff or is it-- which Jean has been kind of heading to, too, to place
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:54.240]   from which you can serve your stuff at your option.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.920]   Jeff, forget a bunch of wind if you can position yourself.
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.920]   OK.
[00:59:58.920 --> 00:59:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.920]   It's a bit of both.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   There's both variants of the idea.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.800]   So one is downloading stuff so you've got a record yourself.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:13.000]   There's interesting ideas from a startup called Curious that is trying to do that for medical
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.600]   data so gather together all the stuff in your senses, your attention to yourself.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.440]   And it's one of the founders of 23andMe and she wants to correlate that with kinetic
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.680]   information and other stuff, too.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.760]   So there's those kinds of sort of personal lockers.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.560]   And her argument was this is a way around this medical privacy thing is it's very actually
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.760]   very hard to gather clinical data for clinical trials because of all the rules about this.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.560]   But gathering data on yourself is allowed.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.080]   And if you want to do that and share it with other people that can work, which I think fits
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:47.520]   in with Jeff's discussions of sharing his illness in public and things like that.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.960]   So there's that side of it.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:55.120]   There are also ones that are providing an encrypted store that will then fill in forms
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:01.640]   for you on the web or will potentially provide an API as an alternative to using Facebook
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:07.920]   for all effectively.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.880]   The challenge there is still we haven't got those standards converged yet.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.280]   But there are several ones working on that that's interesting.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.920]   So Glyph is one of those.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.520]   I think SecureMe was one of those as well.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:22.640]   There were several different startups showing stuff like that here.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:29.000]   And then the other aspects of this that have been, I was on the big data, it becomes big
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.400]   responsibility panel just talking about the idea, what happens with the so-called big
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:45.040]   data, which I was reframing as is actually messy data where what the sort of map reduce
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.680]   worldview comes down to is taking a large amount of messy data and constructing a data
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.720]   miss out of it that you can use for other things.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:59.960]   And that is the size of the data is not so important as the schemallessness of it, if
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.960]   you like.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.240]   And the fact that you can reconstruct schemers arbitrarily rather than spending the time
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.400]   getting the data into the format that you've already decided, you can say, "Oh, I wonder
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.840]   if I can find data in this format, in this pool," and then you write the map reduce to
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:14.840]   construct that.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.040]   And then you've got a database that has that piece in it.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.840]   That makes sense.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:26.320]   But there's tension around that as well because it's the same thing of, "Oh, you mean now
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.280]   I can run facial recognition over all the photographs that you posted 10 years ago that
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.760]   you didn't realize that was possible?"
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.440]   So there is this problem of the computer in the future getting better at making sense
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.440]   of the stuff it has.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.000]   And that does make people nervous to some extent.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.560]   It's something that Google has said that Google has been backing away from facial recognition
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.600]   stuff because it crews people out.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:51.320]   And they're going to end up doing it because everybody else is going to push it forward.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.960]   There's an iPhone app called Click.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.360]   If you take a picture of people, I tried it out.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.360]   It's amazing.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.360]   I took a picture of Chad.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.360]   I didn't even have to take a picture.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.320]   I pointed it at Chad and said, "Oh, this is Chad."
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.480]   Now it's doing it from my social graph from people I have already taken pictures of.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.480]   So I guess in that...
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.480]   Right.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.480]   Which is the case.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.480]   So there's...
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.480]   Right.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.480]   Pecanosa has a good version of that.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.480]   And IOS has a...
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.480]   Nydia's good version of that.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.480]   Right.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:20.440]   Interesting because I think what happens is that's nibbling away at the corners.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.000]   And eventually Google could try to hold the line.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.600]   But if everybody else ends up offering similar things, Google's going to say, "Well, we've
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.040]   got to give in."
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.960]   And then it's really out of the cats out of the bag because Google has so much information.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.800]   And Google has got very good face recognition.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.800]   They know how to do it.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   Come over here.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.800]   I'll take a picture of you.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.440]   Let me see if it can recognize Kevin Marks on TV.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.440]   With a headset on TV.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.440]   Now we can start using the ugly...
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.440]   Yes.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.800]   You want to see something creepy and scary?
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.800]   It did.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.160]   So let me take the picture.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.880]   Let me take the picture.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.880]   And it did it in seconds.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.120]   See it says, "Kevin?"
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.440]   It knew immediately that that was you.
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.440]   Okay.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.440]   That's what face recognition looks like.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.000]   Now, again, don't...
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   Let me see if it does...
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.400]   It'll do you, Gina.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.400]   Don't get scared because this is taking it out of my Facebook.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.560]   Friends, if you're not my Facebook friend, it won't.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.400]   Of course, why do you need it if you're a friend?
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.760]   It would be that as a may.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.640]   Well, because what it does is I take pictures at parties...
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.400]   Ah, stop hiding your face.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.400]   I take pictures at parties.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.400]   And...
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.040]   I'll just start wearing sunglasses inside.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.360]   And it's already tagged because that's what you do in Facebook.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.720]   It thinks you're Lin Fu, by the way.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:30.720]   So you're...
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.720]   Okay.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.720]   You're kind of Asian looking.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.720]   That's right.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.720]   That's right.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.720]   That's right, Jeff.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.720]   She has this in of Asian.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.520]   Coming to us from Blurney.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.760]   Blurney, Jen, Sydney, Australia.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.520]   Let's see if I can get...
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.640]   But by the way, it also gets smart because it learns.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.800]   So you can add people and learn about this.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.640]   This is K-L-I-K on the iPhone.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.320]   It's one of those apps where they haven't tested on moving much.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.400]   Maybe it only works on guys.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.400]   You know what?
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.040]   It's only recognized guys so far.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.800]   And it doesn't recognize you, but you're pretty blurry, Jeff.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.680]   Oh, you moved your head and said, "Oh, I know who that is."
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.680]   Let's see.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.840]   Keep moving your head.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.840]   What's that?
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.800]   It's K-L-I-K on the iOS platform.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.800]   Click.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.600]   But I tell you, I want...
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.600]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.000]   I want this.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.840]   I know everybody, I understand women especially are terrified of the stalking potential blah,
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.920]   blah, blah.
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.760]   But I don't think that's really an issue.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.880]   I think that this is going to be valuable.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.120]   I mean, if somebody's going to stalk you, they don't need to know your name.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.840]   They just follow you.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.080]   I mean, you're looking at someone.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.080]   Right.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.800]   And it just helps you know who it is.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   That's too problematic.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:49.440]   If you take a photograph of someone on the subway and it looks up their name out of the
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.520]   global pool of faces, that's too problematic.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.880]   But you know that the government has this ability and uses this ability now.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.920]   Well, I think the thing is it doesn't actually work very well for the government's use case,
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.680]   which is finding the one terrorist out of millions of people.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:06.560]   But it is quite good at this use case, which is finding the person for the subset of people
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.760]   you already know.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.760]   Yes.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.760]   Right.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:16.720]   One of the things I think Google did an experiment on this where they trained it on faces of
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.480]   celebrities and then got these defined celebrities in photographs.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.560]   And that works well because they have a good training set and they have it and there's
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.800]   only a certain pool of celebrities.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.080]   So you can use it for that.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.480]   But it's not as good at picking somebody you only have one fuzzy photograph of because
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:34.680]   he's a terrorist and he's been hiding his face out of the moving video stream of a camera
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:35.680]   like that.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.120]   Well, let's move on.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.480]   Federal judge has learned to code.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.480]   This big news.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.880]   I love this one.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.200]   And this is a great bit.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.200]   Love this.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.280]   And there was a wonderful blog post from Codinghars that please don't learn to code.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.080]   It comes from Michael Bloomberg who's doing that.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.600]   I don't think Michael Blair of New York really is learning to code, but he tweeted, Oh,
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:00.520]   I'm going to learn to code because there's this new startup, a New York startup.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.520]   That's kind of cool.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.520]   It does teach you.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.800]   I can't remember if it's Ruby or JavaScript.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.440]   They teach you online.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.560]   And so Bloomberg signed up for it.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.600]   Codinghars points out that it will not help him be mayor in any way, shape or form.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:18.680]   And anytime he spends learning JavaScript from code year.com is time wasted solving the
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.680]   problems of.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:23.000]   Well, he's got a little for a new job.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.760]   You know, so by the way, he says, yes, that when Bloomberg does learn to code his his,
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.480]   his first program, his only program will be 10 print.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.080]   I am mayor 20.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:34.080]   Go to 10.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.760]   Which is fairly likely.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.000]   And he says, and I think this is a good point.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.520]   Can you explain to me how Michael Bloomberg would be better at his day to day job of leading
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.720]   the largest city in the US if he woke up one morning as a crack Java code or Jeff atwood
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.440]   coding horror.com.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:56.880]   However, it's nice if it's nice if the judiciary at least understands technology.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.560]   Yes, which they seem to have a great lacking so far.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:04.840]   So if you've got the quote there for the judge, this is wonderful.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.200]   He says, ironically, wait a minute, let me see here.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.000]   Let me find it.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.440]   This is from the O'Reilly radar post by Mike.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.680]   Look at, look at these.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:22.200]   Judge William Alsop learned Java in the course of the trial.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.040]   Can you believe that?
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.160]   I'm trying to find the quote here.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.240]   I think that it's in the link to it.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.520]   It's a wired and it's in the wired.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.880]   He told the court he had learned to code Java for the trial implying he knew other languages
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.960]   as well.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.960]   He said he had written some of the infringing code at least 100.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.960]   What?
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.960]   He says, wait a minute.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.000]   So I've got a two-third transcript here.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.320]   He says, I couldn't have told you the first thing about Java before this problem.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.920]   I have done a significant amount of programming in other languages.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.840]   I've written blocks of code, like range check, 100 times before.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:54.840]   I could do it.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.840]   You could do it.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.080]   The idea that someone would copy that when they could do it themselves just as fast,
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.080]   it was an accident.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:02.000]   There's no way you could say that was speeding along to the marketplace.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.280]   You're one of the best lawyers in America.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:04.920]   How could you even make that kind of thing?
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.880]   Wow, David, boys, wow.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.480]   And boys, I want to come back to range check.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.480]   And the judge says, range check.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.200]   All it does is make sure the numbers are in, put it in range and it gives them some sort
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.600]   of exceptional track.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.400]   That witness, when he said a high school student could do it.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.400]   This is great.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.560]   I wish I'd been in court during this.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.560]   Wow.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.560]   Wow.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.680]   So the point is, the thing that's good about this is not the judge learned to code, which
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.000]   is, that's good in itself.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.080]   The point is, it's part of the culture now.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:36.040]   The fact that people can understand what coding means and what effort is, is really,
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.400]   really important because it means we more like to get sensible decisions in cases like
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.520]   this rather than treat it as some kind of magic like boys is trying to get them to do.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.120]   And that's the difference between, you know, the court cases now and these kinds of losses.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.560]   We've had five, 10 years ago where it was, all this code is pure magic.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.720]   Kevin, Kevin, you're absolutely right.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:10:00.360]   But in journalism, I find this desire to have the mythical journalist coders going to solve
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.360]   everything.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:04.680]   And I think the difference here is that what you're talking about is literacy.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.280]   The judge made it a standard to be literate about coding.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.240]   And that's what we really need.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.240]   Yes.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:17.240]   On the bench in Congress, absolutely.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.240]   But they don't need to code.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.760]   They need to be digitally literate.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:25.800]   But I think that a judge who could say, hey, a range check is simple.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.800]   Anybody could do this.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:32.120]   So calling this infringing code, by the way, this is the Oracle versus Google case, Oracle,
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:40.720]   which bought Sun, which created Java is asserting that its patents and copyrights were violated
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.240]   by Android's use of Java.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:49.200]   But I have to say, I like it that the judge in this case is making these arguments.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.200]   And I think that's good for Google, right?
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:57.760]   He's even saying, you may, you may not have any statutory damages here, which means you
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.960]   may get zero.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.960]   You may continue.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.600]   You may even win this case and get zero Oracle.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.000]   But then then you had stories in the lineup that I didn't understand.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.360]   What's the so so Google doesn't pay anything.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.920]   They could afford anyway.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:15.200]   If they win the case, though, what is the precedent that's this sets?
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.680]   What's what's what does it do to the rest of us?
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.680]   What other cases?
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.680]   Well, it says a precedent that you can copyright APIs, which means they can go around suing
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.160]   other people because their APIs are copyright.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:29.240]   So that's different from copywriting code or patenting code.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:34.800]   Copyrighting an API saying the ability to interface with my software.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:39.520]   By the way, people have pointed out an API could be something as simple as, hey, give
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.000]   me that web page.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.680]   I mean, it's very simple stuff.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.240]   This is the way to access the interface with the system.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.960]   It could be it could be a get request as an API.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:50.960]   Absolutely.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:55.240]   So it makes method patents look like kids worked right.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.200]   And we're already bitching about method patents.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:01.640]   If you could copyright an API and say, hey, get his ours.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.800]   You know, you can't Netscape could say get we invented get.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.840]   No other browser can use it without licensing it.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:08.840]   Oy.
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:09.840]   Oy.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.840]   That's a good word.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:11.840]   Right.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:17.280]   It could totally goes against the whole purpose of an API, which is that people can use it
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.080]   to interface with the system.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.840]   But this is a question of copying the API.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:25.440]   Like, this is about, correct me if I'm wrong on this, but this is because Google created
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:30.360]   Dalvik, which is a different Java runtime, which mimics all the same APIs at the official
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.360]   Java runtime.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:36.360]   The code within Dalvik probably doesn't, I mean, originally Oracle asserted that the
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.080]   code was copied, but I think that they've lost on that.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:42.240]   So now they're saying, well, even if the code wasn't copied, our either.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.240]   This is the interface.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.240]   They're playing with these nine lines in the range check, you know, which is clearly trivial.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.240]   Deminimous.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.240]   Right.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.960]   So throwing that out now, okay, well, but you copied our interface.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:58.520]   But see, that's, well, that goes back to the earliest days of computing when, for instance,
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:03.520]   Phoenix copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS to make it possible to make IBM clones.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.680]   They didn't, they did it in a clean room environment.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.120]   They reverse engineered it.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.680]   They merely made it interface compatible.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:16.400]   That allowed the entire explosion of technologies, personal computer technologies, we know it.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.320]   That would all be thrown out.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.320]   Right.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.320]   Right.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:24.240]   I mean, in a lot of ways they were respecting Java's kind of right once we're on anywhere.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.200]   They could have built Dalvik with a completely brand new lead to five interface, right?
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.880]   Which would have been insane for Java developers.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.960]   They wouldn't have been like, you know, what are these classes?
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:37.040]   What are these methods and interfaces that I'm so used to?
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:42.000]   So in a way, you know, you want them to respect the interface, but they didn't license it.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.520]   So that then that's the issue.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:53.680]   Also Google's attorney complained because there is a debate over how much money was
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.280]   made and Oracle said, well, we're going to find out.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:02.520]   We're going to call Larry Page and Eric Schmidt to the witness stand for the damages phase.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.320]   Google's attorney argued it was a stunt designed to turn the case into a Java versus Android
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.360]   battle when only a few lines of code were infringed.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.280]   Calling the top executives was outrageous.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.840]   The judge did not agree in that case.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.160]   He says the fact that Mr. Big is being subpoenaed.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.760]   This is a big case.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.280]   That doesn't cut much with me, but he did not make a ruling.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.640]   He said, you guys work out.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.480]   He said, I'm busy.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.880]   You figure it out.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.720]   I have to say, does not look like it's going well for Oracle.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.480]   Is that your sense of it to Kevin?
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.480]   That was different.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.480]   My sense of reading that last transcript.
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.760]   But isn't it the argument though that is that but Oracle may win nothing, but we all lose
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.760]   everything?
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:48.120]   Well, it would be if this API if we're allowed to copyright an API, but I have to say I'm
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:52.360]   encouraged by Alsop's clear understanding of what's going on.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.080]   I love it.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.920]   A judge can say, I wrote a range check.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.400]   That's not so hard.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:01.840]   It's pretty fantastic.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.160]   Well, given that they systematically excluded all the jurors who knew how to code, which
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:10.720]   instead of the client, county was like a third of them or something, they've now got a judge
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.520]   and knows how to code, which is good.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.400]   The best person saying that that's the encouraging part for me is that there is a broader understanding
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:22.240]   of this stuff now in the same way that there's a broader understanding of open source ideals
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:26.280]   because Wikipedia is out there and people understand they can edit it.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:32.000]   So that means that we're less likely to get bizarre decisions by courts or even by politicians
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.360]   because they don't have an understanding of this because it is actually more pervasive
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.360]   this culture.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.560]   So that's good.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:47.800]   But it isn't over by any means and the guy who writes Fos Patons, who I think is a pretty
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:55.640]   intelligent guy, Florian Miller, and is by the way a paid consultant for Oracle, I think.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   Microsoft.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.400]   Sorry, Microsoft.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:07.440]   Well, he wrote a blog post saying that yes, I'm a consultant for Oracle, but the timing
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.840]   is a coincidence.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.680]   I'm doing something else.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:17.760]   In any event, Mueller take this with whatever grain of salt you wish says that there's no
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.520]   way Google's use of Java could be considered fair use.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.520]   I take it.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.440]   That's what Google's asserting.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.280]   He says it's equivalent to hijacking the platform.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.800]   Google benefited from the development of Java by basing its code on it, then specifically
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.000]   made Android incompatible.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   Yeah, if you're an open source guy, this is kind of exactly what open source people
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.120]   hate the most, which is you took advantage of our open source work and then you closed,
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.160]   you know, you pulled the ladder up behind you.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:52.720]   He says, on the other hand, George Reese of in Stratus Network says, if APIs can be
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.760]   copied protected, that would be incredibly destructive to the internet as a whole.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:00.240]   Not just the internet technology in general.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:05.720]   As you say, it would have repercussions far beyond the patent problems we already have.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.240]   But we'll see.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.040]   We'll continue to follow this story.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.320]   Court cases are so difficult for us.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.600]   We do have a good show, which I recommend called This Week in Law, where actual attorneys
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.800]   discuss these issues intelligently.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.800]   So that's novel.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.480]   Well, there's so much to talk about, but running out of time, let me just quickly run
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.880]   through a couple of the other top stories.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:35.240]   Apple is probably according to rumors, credible rumors dropping Google Maps for its own in-house
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:41.360]   mapping with an incredible quote, quote, 3D mode.
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.120]   See that coming.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.760]   Yeah, that was pretty obvious.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.760]   And I don't think.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.120]   I think it's a risky move since Google Maps is the default, but remember, Maps Quest used
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.360]   to be the default.
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.360]   And there are.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.360]   Right.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.360]   So these things can change.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.000]   I'm surprised that Google has it tied in more of your personal information into the
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.440]   maps, the more that they brought in our preferences, our history, all that, the more we would be
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.760]   loyal to Google Maps.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.760]   Right.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760]   Well, they do have a lot of issues.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760]   Well, they have a lot of issues.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.760]   But who you, I don't know.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:11.760]   I use latitude.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.760]   I like to be started with something.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.000]   I can still play it with it.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.600]   Yeah, in fact, Kevin and I are the only people who do use yet in that latitude.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.600]   What exactly?
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.600]   Actually, the only people who check in on latitude are people who work for Google.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.200]   That's for us really immediately.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.200]   I see.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.000]   I go, it says, do you want to check in?
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   I go, OK, I'll check in.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.400]   It's like, oh, the leaderboard is like, oh, it is.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.800]   It's all Googles.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.800]   You're right.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.800]   Come to think of it.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:33.800]   Um, it's so funny.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:40.000]   But no, um, but the thing that I found amusing about some of these reports was, was
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   the people who clearly never used Android saying, and these maps are going to be great.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   They're going to have navigation in them.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   And it's like, well, you have actually looked at Android navigation.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   And that is.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   And that's, you know, I suspect Apple can get away with this.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.200]   They can make something that replicates the features they've got now, which, you know,
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.000]   basically haven't moved in two years.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   And add something a little bit better.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.400]   And they'll be like, oh, that's great.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.000]   It's like when they got notifications to iOS.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.800]   But the deep navigation stuff that Google has got will be really hard to replicate without
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.600]   them buying turn by turn data from somebody.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.000]   Because Google got that by driving all those cars.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   Oh, interesting.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.400]   Google made its own turn by turn.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.400]   Right.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.720]   That was the other half of the street you think was actually gathering the turn by turn.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:19.720]   I didn't know that.
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.360]   They didn't buy that from anybody.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.800]   And they bought it before.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.960]   And then they realized when they wanted to do navigation, that was the piece that they
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.120]   weren't going to be allowed to do.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:33.000]   And after Nokia bought one of the big providers coming, which one it was, that was the other
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   shoe dropping.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.240]   There was Navtech and Telenav and Nokia bought one.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.960]   And Eric's in there.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.200]   Somebody bought the other one.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:45.320]   And that was, that did partly led to Google having the, you know, okay, we better get
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.560]   this ourselves as we got more control and everything.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.560]   Interesting.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.640]   And I haven't seen any Apple Street View vehicles.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.640]   No, no.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:55.120]   So I think they would have to license Nav from one of those others.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.360]   But the open street map stuff is good.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:02.360]   And the fact that that's available and that those layers are being supported and even by
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.760]   Microsoft is good too.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.360]   Again, the open stuff.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.800]   I love open street map.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:12.880]   But there's no Nav in open street map and there's no satellite or street view or any
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:13.880]   of that stuff.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.440]   It's just maps.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:21.040]   And the other thing that Google has on Android, which potentially Apple could do is the each
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.840]   Android that's using Nav is feeding the bank traffic data.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.840]   Right.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.080]   There's a huge advantage.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.080]   That's huge.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.120]   And so the Apple, you know, Apple could do that with iPhones.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:35.640]   They could gather it that way, but it's, it won't give them, it could potentially eventually
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.480]   get turned by turn data that way, but you have to have something to bootstrap it.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:45.840]   And a lot of the terms in the data you buy from people, it explicitly tries to stop you
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.840]   doing that kind of thing.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:49.400]   It's trying to mix data from more than one source.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.400]   Interesting.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:54.320]   Finally, the Google glasses are now patent protected.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:59.600]   Of course they would be apparently not just the glasses, but the ornamental design.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:03.320]   Oh, oh, it's geeky.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:04.320]   Now, yeah.
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.960]   The ornamental air quotes.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:08.960]   Wow.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:13.320]   Well, that means they're serious about project glass means nobody else can do project glass
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.440]   quite the same way.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.040]   That's what, that's what.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:20.200]   And the case was here and she had some glasses that really looked like that.
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.800]   I would, I think we should mock some up and walk around and pretend we'd know more than
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:24.800]   we do.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.880]   Oh, hi, Lin Fu.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:29.880]   Wait a minute.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:36.680]   That is truly the only time in my life anyone's ever told me I looked slightly.
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.960]   It wasn't me.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.960]   It was the app.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   It was the app.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   It was the app.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:42.960]   Don't blame me.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.960]   Okay.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:48.120]   And I maybe even the app didn't, I don't know.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:53.680]   And by the way, this patent design has the heads up display right over the eyeball.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:57.280]   So unlike the ones we've seen before where it looked like you had to look up, it looks
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:01.880]   like you really are looking through a screen for this.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.720]   So whether that's telling, I don't know.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.600]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.320]   Come back with tips, numbers and tools.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:15.240]   If you would like Kevin Marks, I will seed my Google tool position to you.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.680]   If you have something you want to talk about otherwise, I could let you go.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:22.160]   If you want to go back to your conference, I see if I can think of a tool.
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.600]   You think about something while I do an ad.
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.480]   If you're not there when I come back, I'll know you recuse yourself.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.480]   Run away.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:29.480]   Run away.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.480]   Run away.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.640]   Want to talk a little bit about go to my PC, the best remote access out there from our
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.400]   good friends at Citrix.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:37.720]   Citrix has a great philosophy.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:42.480]   Make the product better and better and better, upgrade, always be upgrading.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:45.720]   ABG always be upgrading.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.400]   Go to my PC is the best remote access out there.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:51.560]   They started with, of course, the brilliant Citrix platform.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:58.680]   Mac or PC, they use NAT traversal so you never have to do anything scary like open firewall
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:01.840]   ports or things like that.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.280]   They make it simple to install.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:08.680]   You don't have to call IT and say, "I don't understand what's going on."
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:09.680]   It's so great.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:13.000]   It sets up in minutes and then, by the way, you can leave work.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.240]   You can go home.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.360]   You can take, you hit the road.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.160]   You can get work done wherever you go.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.200]   Here's one of the features just added that I think is so cool.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:26.400]   You don't have to just use a computer to access your office computer Mac or PC.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:33.520]   You can use your iPhone or your iPad or your Android tablet free apps available.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.120]   You can use all three.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.280]   Here's the deal.
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.280]   You want to try it?
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.120]   30 days waiting for you at go to my PC.com.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:42.280]   Click the try it free button.
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:45.840]   Use the offer code TWIG.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:52.960]   You can get those free apps, the App Store or the Android Play market.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.600]   You're ready to go.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.360]   Hit the road, Jack.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.680]   Anybody calls you up from work and says, "Hey, where are you?"
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.680]   I'm right at my desk.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.560]   I'm going to send you an email to prove it.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.400]   Send and receive email access to any network resource running program.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.400]   Go to my PC.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.000]   Try it free for 30 days.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:18.600]   Go to my PC.com and then get the app because it's so cool.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:23.520]   Gina Trapani, time for your tip of the week.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.440]   Just got an email about this today.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.360]   An app that we talked about a few episodes ago called Schemer.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.360]   Schemer.com.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.360]   This is a Google app.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:35.160]   It doesn't really quite look like a Google app, but it's a lifeless goal setting app.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.640]   You log in with your Google account.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:40.880]   You say, "I want to climb Mount Everest," or learn how to speak French fluently.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:44.880]   Best icon ever though, because it's just a blue icon with a mustache.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.760]   The mustache icon is great.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.280]   The iPhone app launched today.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.520]   I think when we talked about it on the show, you need an invite.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.760]   You don't need invites to sign up.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.440]   There's a new iPhone app that launched today.
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.200]   There's an Android app.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:02.800]   It's a fun kind of lifeless bucket list kind of app.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.720]   It's really neat to see what your friends want to do.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:09.360]   It all ties into your Google account and your circles.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.360]   The app's pretty good.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.760]   I was playing with it for a little bit before the show.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.680]   Does it look pretty much like the Android app?
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:17.840]   It looks similar to the Android app.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:22.400]   It's iPhone only, not iPad, but it looks similar to Android.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.400]   You know what I love is it gives you this thing.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.640]   How many people I've inspired?
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.360]   I've inspired 651 people.
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.520]   I don't know how.
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.240]   I don't know what I did.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.640]   That means that people have looked at your schemes and hit the "I want to do this" button.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.120]   I mean, they want to do that.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:39.240]   My top schemes install a custom ROM on a rooted Android device.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:40.240]   Done it.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.920]   Visit all seven continents.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.120]   I'm missing one.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.120]   Antarctica.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.360]   Traveled to Norway.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.360]   Did it.
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.400]   So I only have one left on my bucket list.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.840]   But I'm sure there's some other ones.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.400]   So that's kind of cool, isn't it?
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.840]   Yeah, it's a fun app.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:54.840]   Schemer.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:57.440]   Free on iOS now as well as on Android.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.200]   It's really neat to see how many people are scheming to get on Twitch someday.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:03.200]   I'm just saying.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.200]   Stop it.
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.200]   That's a good idea.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.200]   That's a good idea.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:07.200]   I like it.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.480]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.720]   I switched here to get the Opera House behind me if you can see it there.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:14.720]   Look at that.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.720]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:16.720]   The sun's hitting the city.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.720]   The Opera House.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:18.720]   That is gorgeous.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.040]   I also want to thank Uleo for the power of the Ola port last night.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.520]   Only about a few hours beforehand.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:25.760]   I said, oh, anybody wanted to do a twig meet up?
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:30.760]   And Sydney, it's suddenly 15 folks were at a bar with good time.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.320]   I was amazing what you can do.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.960]   So the number of the week is 240.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   There's a story on NPR, which will be on the list about a pizza guy who used $240 worth
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:43.000]   of Facebook ads and really tried to learn how to go viral.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.680]   And so basically he found that everyone on Facebook in New Orleans finally saw his ad.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:48.680]   Wow.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:51.320]   There were general voters which just dropped Facebook.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.000]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.880]   They had a $10 million in your budget on Facebook.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.880]   They said it didn't work.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.880]   The thing that this demonstrates to me is the guy with the pizza guy knew that this is
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:02.880]   about relationships.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:03.880]   He had to drink it.
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:09.600]   He had to figure out who the old days GM of just saying, you will listen to our message
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.600]   are over.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:13.960]   And I think that, yeah, I don't know the Facebook is good or bad as an ad medium.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:14.960]   I don't know.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:18.720]   But I do know that that old attitude that GM would show is over.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:23.560]   Well, I have to say Scott Monty, who's a social guy for Ford, responded to GM pulling
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:29.160]   out saying, well, it kind of depends on exactly what you said, how well you engage, what kind
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.840]   of content, how well you do it.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:33.480]   He said, we're very, Ford is very happy with our Facebook.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:39.080]   Well, Scott, I don't know if that was a chance to zing GM or if they, if they really
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.760]   am in it, but I think that's, that's probably the case.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.840]   Now I have to say people pulling out of a Facebook just makes me happy because of course
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:50.520]   we provide a different kind of advertising from banner advertising and social network.
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.480]   It's a much more engaged kind of advertising.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:55.360]   So I'm not unhappy to see GM pull up.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.360]   There was some concern around here.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.880]   Was this mean forza pull up from Twitter?
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.480]   No, it's exact opposite if anything.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.280]   Jeff, I mean, Kevin, I gave you a chance.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.080]   Do you want to show us something cool?
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.400]   Yes, I do.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.040]   I remembered one.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.760]   So there's now the turntable FM app for Android.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.560]   Oh, he's actually really good.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:14.160]   It's nice to see the iOS one.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.360]   So if you know, turn it over to FM.
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.680]   It's a website that you log into.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.200]   It's American only at the moment, sadly.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:24.880]   And you, you play music for each other in rooms.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.200]   And then there are a bunch of rooms you can go to and he'll play music to you, but you
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.520]   can become a DJ and play music for your friends.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.120]   What I found is the Android one works really nicely.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.120]   It works well.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:36.240]   And it actually has been a good alternative radio for me as I'm driving the car around.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.440]   I can just pick one of the rooms out.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:44.160]   I pick the SCAR music channel and click on that and play a nice range of different SCAR
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:47.200]   music while I'm driving around town.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:52.400]   And so you've got these rooms that are themed and they, but you can also join in and step
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.400]   up and be a DJ.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:58.600]   So I can go into the room and you get the little UI that, from the website there with
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.720]   little animals dancing and stuff going on.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:03.720]   That's really, that's beautiful.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:04.720]   There it is.
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:05.720]   That's very cute.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:09.920]   Now, is it true that no matter what room you go into, it all becomes dubstep eventually?
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.360]   No, no, that's the point.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.360]   Whoops, which one's going on my way?
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.600]   They're actually curated pretty well.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:17.800]   Good.
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:21.920]   By the way, the phenomenats are coming to the mystique, the Phoenix across the street,
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.080]   if you want to come to town next weekend.
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.960]   They're fabulous SCAR band.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.880]   Time table.fm now on Android.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.880]   Thank you.

[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:39.320]   Kevin works for a sales force, but he's also a well-known, very well-spoken advocate
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.560]   for open standards on the net.
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:45.600]   And he does a great podcast called Tumble Vision available at tumblevision.tv.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.120]   Thank you for stopping in.
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:49.120]   Thank you.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.120]   We really appreciate it.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.960]   Kevin Marks on Twitter and of course on Google+.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:57.480]   From Sydney, Australia, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Jarvis, the author of Public Parts.
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:01.560]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com and Google+ is Jeff Jarvis.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.560]   Nice to see you, Jeff.
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.560]   Boy, that's beautiful.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.560]   The sunrise is Sydney.
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.560]   Trying to get it for you.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.560]   That's gorgeous.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.560]   Look at that.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:09.560]   Wow.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:11.560]   Thank you for being here, Jeff.
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:12.560]   Thank you all.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.560]   Gina Trippani is at smarterware.org.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.480]   And of course, she's on Google+, Gina Trippani on Twitter and Gina Trippani.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.160]   Thank you, Gina, for being here.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.160]   Thanks for being here.
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.160]   Thanks for having me.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:28.160]   And I'm going to wrap it up with a video from Google on how email works.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.640]   The story of Send.
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:33.760]   If you've ever wanted to know, Google has a very cute explanation for you.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.760]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.760]   We'll see you next time.
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:36.760]   We'll see you next time.
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.520]   The journey begins as soon as you press Send.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:44.200]   This prompts your message to travel through cable or DSL lines to our infrastructure and
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:46.120]   into our data center.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:50.040]   When your message reaches our data center, we protect it with a wide range of security
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.040]   measures.
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:56.800]   Like security cameras, IRIS scans, and fingerprint scans in our buildings.
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:00.760]   Your message then enters the networking room where our equipment sends it to the Gmail
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:03.680]   servers on our server floor.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:08.120]   Our servers work together to process your data, including duplicating your message to
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.120]   create backups.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.560]   We read everything you write and then we put an ad on it.
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:14.000]   Anyway, that's the story of Send.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000]   You get the idea.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.920]   At one point, they say they keep their server rooms at 82 degrees.
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:20.920]   Really?
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:21.920]   They save on cooling costs.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:22.920]   Not 70 degrees.
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:26.720]   So when I said, you know, or Googlers can come to work in their shorts.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:31.920]   You know, in the video, there's a guy, a bearded guy in shorts going by and is scooter.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:32.920]   It's about green.
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.320]   And scanning it for viruses.
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:40.560]   All our servers are shared between our products, which means we can do more with less, more
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.560]   searches.
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:42.560]   Thank you.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.560]   Goodbye.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:47.200]   You can find this if you want to watch the whole thing on their Google green account
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.200]   on YouTube.
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.040]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.680]   We do this show every Wednesday, 1 p.m.
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:52.680]   Pacific or p.m.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.360]   Eastern time, 2000 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:00.600]   But if you miss it, you can always get video and audio after the fact at twit.tv/twig.
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:04.720]   Join us next week for another episode and welcome to our new producer, Chad Johnson.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.640]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:16.640]   [MUSIC]
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:19.220]   (gentle music)
